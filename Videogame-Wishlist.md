# Videogame-Wishlist

This is a preference list that I decided to record and publish.  It's not about real games, and real games may or may not be able to take items off the list.  There's no particular reason to believe anything on this list will ever come into existence if it doesn't already have examples in the wild.

1.  Dragon Life Simulator
    * 1 turn = 1 season?  Tons of ways to do this, and my idea of dragons is typically civilian to boot.  I still think someone should make a dragon merchant simulator.  Anyways, this is a perennial for me.
    * Examples:  Golden Treasure, only?
2.  Ballistic Passenger Business Simulator
    * Imagine if airline travel used rockets.  This would be a good excuse for a near-future sci-fi setting, since we could technically already do this, and it might help get people over a certain fear of rocket travel.  The game would have obvious potential to expand into interplanetary transit; expanding your business to service Lunar flight would be a good 'early-mid' objective, expanding your business to service Martian travelers would be a good 'mid-late' objective, and expanding to the outer planets would either be 'endgame' in a base design or a great material for a DLC.
    * Examples:  None that I know of; rocket simulators aren't rare, but profit-oriented passenger rocket simulators...  Well, I know of one, but it's purely interplanetary.  People don't seem to realize that terrestrial rocket passenger transit is possible, yet I think any business that launches people between worlds is likely to start out by hunting down profitable edgecases for accelerated transit in terrestrial markets.
3.  Reincarnationist Life Simulator
    * A minimalist life simulator designed for playing many briefly simulated lives, with soul variables accreting over time.  Soul variables in turn influence future lives.  Making different choices available and altering what choices are prosperous is the obvious thing for soul variables to affect, but I think it'd be more interesting if there was a sort of multiverse of diverse potential lives such that the player could try to 'aim for' different potentials by accumulating the right karmic soul traits.
    * Examples:  None?  I loved the life simulator genre ~15 years ago, but I never got to play the full versions of the programs that I loved most, and one of the ones I played exhaustively kind of lost me to the genre.  I'm not big on life simulators anymore.  The basic concept of a minimized life simulator with many iterations that accumulate some kind of stats over iterations seems like it might exist already, albeit that I would expect its current existence to be in a "grinding for progress" mode without full respect for the narrative potential of its game mechanics.
4.  Capacity vs Confidence vs Flexibility Economic Simulator
    * A nation or psuedonational entity simulator focusing on **abstractly** managing the development in a geographical area, with a key variable trichotomy implemented across many of the kinds of development: capacity vs confidence vs flexibility.  Capacity is the development's ability to provide normal services under normal conditions.  Confidence is the development's ability to gain capacity over time.  Flexibility is the capacity's ability to absorb shocks (demand spikes and/or disasters) as well as its ability to tolerate fluctuations in available resources (due to planning changes or opportunistic adjustments).  All three are desirable and under normal conditions in most of the development sectors all three grow over time; despite this, the three should be a trichotomy in that they trade off against each other in policy.  Think about how expensive disaster planning can be.  THe resources put into that aren't being put into providing normal services under normal conditions.
    * The technologies, policies, and other player-interfacing state modifications given by the game should modify the balance of the trichotomy in various domains.  The basic currency of policy actions is then given by the flexibility in each category of development.  All actions which do not increase flexibility instead deplete it, and actions which demand flexibility that isn't there cannot be taken.
    * Spending too much flexibility changing policies increases vulnerability to disaster; building for flexibility to enable both active policy management and disaster resilience risks long-term deficits in policy confidence (too much uncertainty to implement services).
    * The actual economy should have a bunch of numbers.  Lots of numbers.  Snrk.  I mean, it should also be an economic simulation.  The 'kinds of development' - perhaps I should call them sectors - should be goods and services that make sense as being critical for the nation or psuedonational entity.  An example that occurred to me as good for illustrating the trichotomy is housing.  We can imagine that the housing market has a market capacity, a market confidence, and a market flexibility.  Disaster planning investments would increase housing market flexibility while sapping its confidence; same for urban planning actions in general.  A flexible housing market is good at providing unshakeable capacity, but if it lacks all confidence, it may be apt to be providing that capacity in the form of bunkers, tents, and brutalist apartments, which is to say flexibility in the absence of confidence offers within this model a mixture of what is miserably planned with service provision that is never good enough to insist on keeping.  If you instead promote aggressive capacity gains, you will produce much better housing, but unless some great disaster knocks flexibility back into the policy, you may never get back the planning resources you put towards increasing confidence.
    * Oh yes, great disasters.  A major focus of this system should be events reported from beyond the ordinary policy flow, some large, many small, some fast, some slow.  The simulation's numbers should be frothy.  I don't think actual governments ever quite feel like they're in control of the economy, and that is missing from a lot of games.  The abstractness of this presentation (standard trichotomy and lots of numbers) should make it easier to come up with fluctuating elements that keep the economy from feeling quite controllable.  Sectors should be suffering frequent shocks and fluctuating pressures, preserving an overall growth trajectory only on average.  I think "preserving an overall growth trajectory only on average" is an excellent description for how human economic development tends to proceed.  This will need some mathematical proving to balance correctly.  The reward of doing it is that this rolling whale of an economy is what gives power to the question of pursuing confidence or flexibility in this simulator's concept.
      * Do you trust the twisting economy to not collapse when you tell it to push hard forward in a sector?  When, and with what preparations?
      * When are investments in flexibility protective of confidence through mitigating disaster?  Which sectors benefit most from being hardened against the froth in their event potentials?
      * When is it tolerable to let a sector get hollowed out by economic fluctuations?
    * Examples:  None.
5.  Cannabis-Friendly Exercise Game
    * It's harder to focus on exercise while high, but when I've managed to do it, I've enjoyed exercising while high considerably more than exercising sober.  I think people may be missing out on it as a hedonic potential.  Cannabis is known for being a stunning/slowing kind of effect, but in my sample=1 of experience, resisting the slowing from cannabis also makes exertion feel better.
    * If there's one thing videogames are good at, it's grabbing attention.  That this attention-grabbing function works beyond the realm of merely sitting down and pushing buttons has been core to much of my own exercise.  The interactive training environment can mitigate the disadvantage of exercising while high (poor focus) so that doing it is more reliable.
    * This concept promotes a recreational psychoactive for the sake of its customers' health.  I confess to pharmacoutopianism.
    * Exercise games are always of lower quality...  I think they're more than a genre shift, as different as being a wholly different technology in the videogame industry.  The best I've found have already made a positive difference in my life, and I think this is something that the industry will develop as a broader talent in the future.  Exercise games are just such an important tool for making good health voluntary...  They're a pure application of [[hedonology]].
    * Examples:  I'd be surprised.
