# Videogame-Wishlist

This is a preference list that I decided to record and publish.  It's not about real games, and real games may or may not be able to take items off the list.  There's only one item on the list; I'm in no hurry to define this space.

1.  Dragon Life Simulator
    1 turn = 1 season?  Anyways, this is a perennial.
    Examples:  Golden Treasure
