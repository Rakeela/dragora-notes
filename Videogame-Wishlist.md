# Videogame-Wishlist

This is a preference list that I decided to record and publish.  It's not about real games, and real games may or may not be able to take items off the list.  There's no particular reason to believe anything on this list will ever come into existence if it doesn't already have examples in the wild.

1.  Dragon Life Simulator
    * 1 turn = 1 season?  Tons of ways to do this, and my idea of dragons is typically civilian to boot.  I still think someone should make a dragon merchant simulator.  Anyways, this is a perennial for me.
    * Examples:
      * - Golden Treasure
      * - TBF (To Be Found)
2.  Ballistic Passenger Business Simulator
    * Imagine if airline travel used rockets.  This would be a good excuse for a near-future sci-fi setting, since we could technically already do this, and it might help get people over a certain fear of rocket travel.  The game would have obvious potential to expand into interplanetary transit; expanding your business to service Lunar flight would be a good 'early-mid' objective, expanding your business to service Martian travelers would be a good 'mid-late' objective, and expanding to the outer planets would either be 'endgame' in a base design or a great material for a DLC.
    * Examples:
      * - There's at least one of these already on the market; I believe I've scrolled past one on Steam a dozen times by now.  There might be two.  Or four.  I'll play one eventually.
      * - I've also played one of these, it's already in my Steam library.  I'll list its name here if I ever play it again.  It disappointed me in this sense by inadequately developing the ballistic passenger phase of the business simulation.  I want a more specialist title, like an Aerobiz Supersonic of passenger rocketry in Earth orbit, which opens up gradually to new markets in other orbits.
3.  Reincarnationist Life Simulator
    * A minimalist life simulator designed for playing many briefly simulated lives, with soul variables accreting over time.  Soul variables in turn influence future lives.  Making different choices available and altering what choices are prosperous is the obvious thing for soul variables to affect, but I think it'd be more interesting if there was a sort of multiverse of diverse potential lives such that the player could try to 'aim for' different potentials by accumulating the right karmic soul traits.
    * Examples:  
      * - TBF
4.  Capacity vs Confidence vs Flexibility Economic Simulator
    * A nation or psuedonational entity simulator focusing on **abstractly** managing the development in a geographical area, with a key variable trichotomy implemented across many sectors of development: capacity vs confidence vs flexibility.  Capacity is the sector's ability to provide quality services under normal conditions.  Confidence is the sector's ability to gain capacity over time.  Flexibility is the sector's ability to absorb shocks (demand spikes and/or disasters) as well as its ability to tolerate fluctuations in available resources (due to planning changes or opportunistic adjustments).  All three are desirable and on average all three tend to increase; despite this shared tendency, the three should be a trichotomy in that they trade off against each other in policy.  Think about how expensive disaster planning can be.  The resources put into that aren't being put into providing quality services under normal conditions.
    * The technologies, policies, and other player-interfacing state modifications given by the game should modify the balance of the trichotomy in various domains.  The basic currency of policy actions is then given by the flexibility in each sector.  All actions which do not increase sectoral flexibility instead deplete it, and most actions deplete it.  Actions which demand flexibility that isn't there cannot be taken.  Planning actions typically deplete flexibility as well rather than provide immediate gains, but they are actually investments in increasing flexibility's growth tendency.
    * Spending too much flexibility changing policies increases vulnerability to disaster; building for flexibility to enable both active policy management and disaster resilience risks long-term deficits in policy confidence (too much uncertainty to implement services).  Since planning investments deplete current flexibility in exchange for future flexibility, overinvestment in planning can expose your capacities to being immediately wrecked while you're working on gaining the ability to defend them.
    * An example that occurred to me as good for illustrating the trichotomy in action is housing.  We can imagine that the housing market has a market capacity, a market confidence, and a market flexibility.  Disaster planning investments would increase housing market flexibility while sapping its confidence, possibly quite directly; urban planning actions in general would create a kind of weight of government which would have the same effect over longer time horizons.  A flexible housing market is then good at providing unshakeable capacity, but if it lacks all confidence, it may be serving its capacity in the form of bunkerized architecture.  If its capacity is not also excellent, it is more apt to be a society of bunkers, slums, and tents, which is to say flexibility in the absence of confidence offers within this model a mixture of what is miserably planned with service provision that is never good enough to insist on keeping.  If you instead promote aggressive capacity gains, you will produce much better housing, but unless some great disaster knocks flexibility back into the policy, you may never get back the planning resources you put towards increasing confidence.
    * Oh yes, great disasters.  A major focus of this system should be events reported from beyond the ordinary policy flow, some large, many small, some fast, some slow.  The simulation's numbers should be frothy.  I don't think actual governments ever quite feel like they're in control of the economy, and that is missing from a lot of games.  The abstractness of this presentation (standard trichotomy and lots of numbers) should make it easier to come up with fluctuating elements that keep the economy from feeling quite controllable.  Sectors should be suffering frequent shocks and fluctuating pressures, preserving an overall growth trajectory only on average.  I think "preserving an overall growth trajectory only on average" is an excellent description for how human economic development tends to proceed.  This will need some mathematical proving to balance correctly.  The reward of doing it is that this rolling whale of an economy is what gives power to the question of pursuing confidence or flexibility in this simulator's concept.
      * Do you trust the twisting economy to not collapse when you tell it to push hard forward in a sector?  When, and with what preparations?
      * When are investments in flexibility protective of confidence through stabilizing performance?  Which sectors benefit most from being hardened against the froth in their event potentials?
      * When is it tolerable to let a sector get hollowed out by economic fluctuations?
    * Beyond the trichotomy, the game's economy should also have a bunch of numbers.  Lots of numbers.  Snrk.  I mean, it should also be an economic simulation.  The sectors should represent categories of development that make sense as being critical for the nation or psuedonational entity that the player is influencing.  This determination of which sectors are present is a very central reflavoring potential in this game concept; a sci-fi game about an alien uplift government trying to turn a backwater economy into an advanced and futuristic one (I tip a wing to [[The Viceroy]]) would have very different sectors from an [[existential threat]] simulator focused on the perils of well-matured growth tendencies.  Renaming the sectors and reseeding their event tables could produce very different games.
    * Examples:  This is too conceptually specific to implement.
5.  Cannabis-Friendly Exercise Game
    * It's harder to focus on exercise while high, but when I've managed to do it, I've enjoyed exercising while high considerably more than exercising sober.  I think people may be missing out on it as a hedonic potential.  Cannabis is known for being a stunning/slowing kind of effect, but in my sample=1 of experience, resisting the slowing from cannabis also makes exertion feel better.
    * If there's one thing videogames are good at, it's grabbing attention.  That this attention-grabbing function works beyond the realm of merely sitting down and pushing buttons has been core to much of my own exercise.  The interactive training environment can mitigate the disadvantage of exercising while high (poor focus) so that doing it is more reliable.
    * This concept promotes a recreational psychoactive for the sake of its customers' health.  I confess to pharmacoutopianism.
    * Exercise games are always of lower quality...  I think they're more than a genre shift, as different as being a wholly different technology in the videogame industry.  The best I've found have already made a positive difference in my life, and I think this is something that the industry will develop as a broader talent in the future.  Exercise games are just such an important tool for making good health voluntary...  They're a pure application of [[hedonology]].
    * Examples:
      * - TBF
6.  Abstract yet Detailed Grand Strategy Game with Weird Maps
   * I was thinking about Warlock 2's usage of a many-little-planar-bubbles map, and I thought that a decent game might be made through collapsing each planar bubble to a single location, essentially a 'province' tile in a strategy game operating at the more abstract scale where 'cities' and 'units' are less individually considered.  I like weird maps (as with fantasy strategy gaming), but weird maps are less represented at the abstract scale of strategy gaming.
   * Examples:
     * - Dominions series (with creative fan-made maps) (still uses individual units)
7.  Mental Transcription Economic and/or Political Simulator
   * I think at least one entire very fascinating game could be derived from the Mental Transcription technology from [[The Viceroy]].  Imagine adjusting the thoughts of the public via control of the policies of an institution which transcribes information to their minds.  This could be a very interesting variation of an economic and/or political simulator.
   * As a pure political simulator, this would be heavy; it would necessarily lean on the control aspect.  This is probably the *easiest* title to make with this concept, although I think it disappoints the potential of it.  Easy to make and easy to play, but bluntly didactic.
   * As a pure economic simulator, this would be much lighter; expanding the service and making it more productive would be nearly or entirely the whole of the game.  This is the most cheerful possibility, but it would also be rather ferocious to implement, as the simulation would need to account for rapidly fluctuating skills and talents across the population.  It would need to tell the story of the public changing as they use the service.
   * Other options exist on the spectrum between them.  I think the continuum may be smooth, such that increasing political content makes the economic simulation steadily easier to make, while also making the game get steadily starker and darker.
   * I think this tech would be awesome IRL, but only if it were run with full respect for civil rights.  Which should certainly be an *option* in any such simulations...  I think a purely economic approach is most likely to intuitively respect civil rights.  Overwriting people's free will with information transcription is likely to be difficult, controversial, and costly... all things that can be readily avoided by making sure the service runs voluntarily and in pursuit of customer satisfaction.
   * This concept expresses the transhuman concept of "Machine-Assisted Free Will"... especially in settings where people have their rights protected, since if mental transcription is implemented without rights violations what it does is that it makes people effectively much smarter and quick to learn.  It would empower the public to make the process of self-changing over time quicker and more competent.  They would become more like their own ideal self.
  8.  Anti-God God Game
   * A God Game in which God wants people to be atheists who disbelieve in God's existence, but is stuck governing people who are both attentive and superstitious.
   * Trying to help a society develop without getting blamed for it is the central challenge of the game.
   * This may also be appropriate theming for a game based on 'Alien Uplift' scenarios.  The uplift engineers want to help people very badly, but they don't want to be blamed for anything they do.  They instead want the society they help to develop the capacity of helping itself.
  9.  Civ vs Weather Game
   * Historic civilizations sometimes died due to climate mismanagement... or even due to climate fluctuations that weren't credibly their fault.  Long-term development frequently knocked over too many forests, built too many walls of dry stone, or leached too many nutrients from soils that people didn't know how to conserve.  People didn't know what they didn't know.  Sometimes people even intuited pieces of the right answer, but didn't pass their knowledge on effectively to others.
   * This might be suitable for some kind of abstract 'zeitgeist' game where the player has limited influence over the development of a planet full of nations that separately (and competitively) develop across the planet.  I have no idea what kind of influence to give the player for this concept.  Inspirations for the people in the nations?  Specific surprise weather events to unleash against them?  Temporary regional climate alterations to favor, distort, or restrict development?  Who is the player: God, Gaia, or an Uplift Overseer?  The player doesn't necessarily have to be identified (who is 'the player' who can decide all the things the player decides while playing Civ?), but the question begs to be asked when deciding what toolkit the player has access to.
   * The nations should respond to the simulation according to their own AI, while playing a slightly different game with each other.  (They're strategy game AIs.)
   * Left to their own devices, the developing civilizations should destroy the ecology, sometimes self-destructing in the process.  As they get more capable, their ecological blast radius should increase accordingly, until the end game is managing late industrialization without the ecology collapsing globally.  The game ends when the planet's sapients are collectively sustainable or dead; the player's job is to make a simulation that will play itself to death achieve sustainability instead.
   * For rating 'sustainable' outcomes (only), I would recommend tallying multiple high score boards for the game.  The first high score board I would recommend would treat the player's unspent influence budget as their score.  This rewards the player for minimalist interventions such that the game *mostly* plays itself.  The second high score board would be a turn count with ties broken by the planet's historic average quality of life score.  This rewards the player for active intervention which spends influence freely to stabilize the simulation as quickly as possible.  The third and final high score board I would recommend, would be the historic average quality of life score with ties broken by the turn count.  This rewards the player for active intervention which spends influence freely to achieve a 'best possible outcome'.
   * For rating 'dead' outcomes, I recommend a single Tragedy board.  The Tragedy score is the planet's average quality of life score across the entire game, on the idea that the better their lives were, the greater the collective tragedy that their society burned itself out.  Ties are broken by the turn count as with the third sustainable high score board, but here higher turn counts are preferred.  Spending a long time holding on in quiet desperation at a high level of development makes the tragedy greater.
