# Videogame-Wishlist

This is a preference list that I decided to record and publish.  It's not about real games, and real games may or may not be able to take items off the list.  There's only one item on the list; I'm in no hurry to define this space.

1.  Dragon Life Simulator
    1 turn = 1 season?  Tons of ways to do this, and my idea of dragons is typically civilian to boot.  I still think someone should make a dragon merchant simulator.  Anyways, this is a perennial for me.
    Examples:  Golden Treasure, only?
2.  Ballistic Passenger Business Simulator
    Imagine if airline travel used rockets.  This would be a good excuse for a near-future sci-fi setting, since we could technically already do this, and it might help get people over a certain fear of rocket travel.  The game would have obvious potential to expand into interplanetary transit; expanding your business to service Lunar flight would be a good 'early-mid' objective, expanding your business to service Martian travelers would be a good 'mid-late' objective, and expanding to the outer planets would either be 'endgame' in a base design or a great material for a DLC.
    Examples:  None that I know of; rocket simulators aren't rare, but profit-oriented passenger rocket simulators...  Well, I know of one, but it's purely interplanetary.  People don't seem to realize that terrestrial rocket passenger transit is possible, yet I think any business that launches people between worlds is likely to start out by hunting down profitable edgecases for accelerated transit in terrestrial markets.
