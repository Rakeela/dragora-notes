10:11.  I got up early and played videogames for hours!  This morning was so fun.  I completed my Old World playthrough and then I played a round of Democratic Socialism Simulator.

10:12.  59,250.  59,252.

10:14.  It's such a privilege to be exposed to human culture.

10:33.  59,334.  My inspiration is dwindling.

12:26.  Back to work, sort of.  I have a TTRPG thing going simultaneously.

14:10.  TTRPG thing over.  59,462.  As you can see, I wasn't very productive during the game.

16:40.  60,965.  Taking another break.  Whee, I'm not working too hard this time.

21:04.  62,881.  3,631 words of progress.
