#envs100-World-Hunger 

I could just blather for a page here, couldn't I?  I feel like confronting this assignment while being myself is cheating, somehow.  The emotional loading is still real, though.

I hope to someday perform experiments with xenomitochondria, transplanting mitochondria of different species to each other, hunting for clues as to what factors optimize mitochondrial metabolism.  I'm prone to strange ambitions, and I confess that I'm drawn to this very much for the fact that I think it could have applications for opening space travel to humanity[1], yet in more down-to-Earth applications I think transgenic mitochondria could yield increases in the rate at which plants accumulate energy.  As mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell[2], I hope that crop strains with improved mitochondrial genetics will have higher EROI.  Intuitively, that seems likely to improve crop growth rates, but I'm a little concerned about jumping straight to food applications; rather, I believe that a better first yield of plant mitochondria transplants would be to attempt to create crops more suitable for biofuel processing.  This is particularly salient as the most amenable crops for mitochondrial experimentation are likely to be algae, due to their well-established role as a research subject[3], rapid growth properties[4], and existing role in biofuel industry[5].

[4]  Algae's fast growth is good for research
[5]  Algae is used for biofuel, OR being studied for biofuel applications (redraft in this case)

This is not a one-page essay, but I bet it'll get longer as I work it over.
