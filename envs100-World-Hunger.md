#envs100-World-Hunger 

I could just blather for a page here, couldn't I?  I feel like confronting this assignment while being myself is cheating, somehow.  The emotional loading is still real, though.

I hope to someday perform experiments with xenomitochondria, transplanting mitochondria of different species to each other, hunting for clues as to what factors optimize mitochondrial metabolism.  I'm prone to strange ambitions, and I confess that I'm drawn to this very much for the fact that I think it could have applications for opening space travel to humanity[1], yet in more down-to-Earth applications I think transgenic mitochondria could yield increases in the rate at which plants accumulate energy.  As mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell[2], I hope that crop strains with improved mitochondrial genetics will have higher EROI.  Intuitively, that seems likely to improve crop growth rates, but I'm a little concerned about jumping straight to food applications; rather, I believe that a better first yield of plant mitochondria transplants would be to attempt to create crops more suitable for biofuel processing.  This is particularly salient as the most amenable crops for mitochondrial experimentation are likely to be algae, due to their well-established role as a research subject[3] and rapid growth properties[4].  Note that source doesn't attest to algae specifically, but it gives the properties research organisms should have: the ability to grow on simple medium, give rise to large populations quickly, and with easily isolated genomic material.

This is not a one-page essay, but I bet it'll get longer as I work it over.

Also, why am I a farmer?  I completely resent feeding people *and* I tend to want hyper-processed foods exclusively... but getting into space requires biotechnological advances.  Bah.

I'm really disappointed by that source 4.  I found this information about algae directly, but I wasn't successful at digging it up this time.  The way I use these sources might change when I redraft this tomorrow.

I think I need to load this up in Pages to get a better sense of what "1 page" is.

Drafted in Pages; I think this is my final copy:

**Algae and the Dragon’s Desire**

I’ve been prone to big ambitions all my life. Challenged with being asked how and why I would fight world hunger, my reaction is split between the existential horror of the problem itself, and the enthusiasm I have for how fighting it fits into my personal ambitions.

As an otherkin transhumanist, I need human biotechnology to advance in leaps and bounds for me to exist in what I consider my own flesh. Along the path of biotechnology, I am aware of the potential for many advances in agricultural productivity. This is the WHY for my will to oppose world hunger. The more conventional altruistic perspective… horrifies me, in truth. I find it overwhelming to think about the extent of human suffering, and so I have to own the selfish perspective as the one which lets me face the problem in a way that would help. I want to change who I am, but I have to change the world to do it.

As for the how, I believe that one of the technologies supportive of transformative surgeries will be mitochondrial transplants. Medically, I would like to produce protocols for donor mitochondria and mitochondria fabrication, so that better mitochondrial support can be made available for serious surgeries, reducing tissue damage and promoting a swift, complete recovery. This technology has agricultural applications as well, as I believe that transgenic engineering of mitochondria can be utilized to produce the next generation of new, superior crop strains. It is no mere foolish aphorism that dubs the mitochondria “the powerhouse of the cell,”\[1\] but that aphorism gained its power as we should wish all aphorisms would: by its apparent accuracy. I believe that by improving mitochondrial populations, we can accelerate the growth of crops. Most particularly, I believe that this should be directed towards creating next-generation biofuels to resolve resource exhaustion issues in the economy; nor by this do I mean to step away from the issue of resolving world hunger, as I believe that the necessity of fuel in agriculture is broadly and straightforwardly comprehensible.

I intend to try to create organizations the necessity of which humanity doesn’t yet understand, and I expect that one way or another those organizations will be involved in global agriculture. Although I would love to direct all research efforts wholly and purely at the objectives of my ambitions, I understand that I will need to serve other causes in order to gain the necessary resources. In one form or another, I believe that my greatest eusocial aptitude _is_ agricultural. I do not believe that humanity should have ever-growing populations (the basic nihilism of naturalism contributes to the existential horror of the altruistic attitude to agricultural productivity), but I do believe that the problem of world hunger can be solved in a way which supports people in living meaningful lives.

I would even like to move off-world someday. I believe that ‘upgraded’ mitochondria will be the solution to muscle wasting in space\[2\], and if I am wrong about that, I am nevertheless reasonably confident that mitochondrial research will be a necessary aspect of finding the correct answer. This is more of the ‘why’ and less of the ‘how’, but I believe that it’s important to mention. Turning agricultural supply towards the support of industry is critical in achieving sustainable industries that will uphold human prosperity in a truly indefinite manner.

To return briefly to the ‘how’, I look forward to a day not so many years in the future when I will be performing or overseeing the performance of experiments using fast-breeding algae strains to find mitochondria which can further optimize the growth of the algae. As a food crop, algae is dispiriting slime; as an industrial and research crop, algae is inspirational microflora. It is already being studied for biofuel\[3\], and I want to be part of that.
