If we wanted to accelerate carbon storage in forests, could we try to use 'maximum sustainable yield' without extracting the resulting wood?  Compost it and redeliver it to the forest, or cover a desert with it to try to alter local microclimes in a way that reverses desertification, or throw it in the sea somewhere that rotting a bunch of wood will release nutrients to the ecology.

The trees store carbon as they *grow*.  If we get rid of competing trees, will the trees not grow faster?  Especially if this is paired with local soil improvement and other afforestation management measures, it could be used to create a planned carbon sink that invests in the humus of its region.

Alternatively, wood could be used to deliver moisture to the desert.  It could change the ground's heat absorption and reflectivity profile, while shading the soil and encouraging condensation.  It would tend to retain water if any fell on it; although the wood of its own would end up bone dry, it would still retain water *relatively* better than the sand, and so a region of a great deal of dry wood would exceed the desert in retaining water.  If all that dry wood caught fire, the ashen region would still be better soil than the desert.  Alternatively, if the wood were kept moist, it would rot in place, providing habitat for insects and pioneering flora that would push back desertification.  This would also result in more carbon sinkage and eventually better available soil quality.

The third possibility that occurred to me would be to throw the wood into the sea.  Aquatic environments are often scarce of resources, but they're important for maintaining the climate's self-regulatory capabilities.  Making them less resource-scarce, as by harvesting a forest not for building material but for biological material, would make the more effective as carbon sinks.  We might also use this surplus wood to provide biodegradable protective structures and growing surfaces for important classifications of life, such as heat-sensitive reefs.  If reefs get too hot...  why don't we build reef-shades?

A lot of times in my life, it has seemed like systems around me are hyper-responsive to prove that they're attentive, but strictly only when their hyper-responsivity would itself be abusive.  When I've honestly and greatly needed interventions, they've always been missing.

Oftentimes the frustration factor has been greatly intensified by the fact that the interventions which are most necessary amount to "showing up" - people showing up and speaking supportively at the right times would have saved me from a lot of grief in my personal history.  People make a show of doing that, but only when it's useless, such as in private, or after they've publicly staked a claim against me and are thereafter privately contradicting it while publicly continuing to try to hurt me.  My husband does a lot of that, and has pretty much contributed to my being kicked out of social environments by "supporting" me only in private while publicly endorsing the idea that I deserved to be punished.  It's part of why I don't consider him a suitable father; I wouldn't want him to treat a child of ours that way.

I've just realized; I'm a public figure.  Not in a conventional widely-recognized sense, but in the sense that any aspect of who I am may have been examined by a stranger at some point, and I don't really have an "other side" which is concealed from that visibility.  Furthermore, I'm most comfortable interacting with other people who are public figures in the same sense.

I can't be doxxxed.  That would only drive attention to me.  Everything that a doxxxing watcher might try to root up has already been tried unsuccessfully to hurt me.  Someone dumping a lot of information to me, face-to-face, under their own name and acknowledging my name, wouldn't be stalking me.  They'd be showing me more respect than an authoritarian stalker cult could bear to grant.
