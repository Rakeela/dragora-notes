Qualms per Challenge
One of the hidden themes of this game seems to be the question of whether all of its technologies are actually desirable.  That extends to the challenges and their cures.  I'll list all of them and mark 'no objections' if I've come up with no qualms.

Ecological Collapse
Economic Restrictions
 * Cure tech:  Lord Economic
 * Commentary:  Centralizing economic authority to that extent is a downright bizarre concentration of power.  It's hard to imagine such a thing being proven to be scientifically optimal.  In an environment of blatantly excessive restrictions, it's a little easier to imagine such a thing being proven to be scientifically optimal, and yet that only seems like a potentially harmful temptation.  Particularly in an environment of ecological collapse, it seems likely that the restrictions arose with sensible purposes, and leaving them to be resolved by domestic authorities rather than destroying them at viceregal command seems friendlier to the region.
Invasive Organisms
 * Cure tech:  Orbital Surveyor
 * Commentary:  No objections.
Photosynthetic Plague
 * Cure tech:  Hydroponic Farms
 * Commentary:  No objections.
Ecological Collapse
 * Cure tech:  Weather Control Network
 * Commentary:  No objections.
Erratic Orbit
 * Cure tech:  Green Belt
 * Commentary:  Why should the galaxy be denied the specific variations of life that develop under these wide seasonal variations?  This is the kind of thing that could lead to discoveries in how to prosperously inhabit more edge-case environs.  Working too hard to fix this seems much less rewarding than working around it.  Also, the cure tech makes little sense; I'm not convinced that the society depicted in the game would actually be able to fix an erratic orbit.  I'd be a little more content in this sense if the cure tech were 'Beyonder Engines'.
Ice Age
 * Cure tech:  Orbital Habitats
 * Commentary:  Since this is 'fixed' by Orbital Habitats, I'm assuming that means moving the population centers to orbit so that the green band around the center of the planet can be more completely reserved for agriculture.  I have no objections, I just wanted to record my thoughts about how to interpret the cure tech.
Biological Embargo
 * Cure tech:  Stasis Controller
 * Commentary: I kind of like all the embargo zones in this game.  Conceptually, areas that are operating X or Y embargo are resisting a tendency to destructive overspecialization while encouraging the development of local industrial and technical capabilities which may ultimately diverge from galactic standards in novel ways.  I can see how breaking these embargo zones would result in short-term productivity gains, but I don't like doing it.
Solar Disruption
 * Cure tech:  Solar Moderator
 * Commentary: I wish I could say 'no objections', because an unstable primary star sounds terrible.  Yet my opinion goes to the same thing as the Erratic Orbit opinion.  What kind of lifeforms would prosper in a kaleidoscopic weather system?  If the ecosystem were supported heavily (symbiotic ecosystem research and weather control systems) what would vibrance look like in an environment where the weather changes so often?  That seems like a better spectacle to offer the galaxy than yet another star smoothed by imperial stellar infrastructure.
Systemwide Quarantine
 * Cure tech:  Orbital Hospitals
 * Commentary: Well, it's definitely described as an unpleasant thing, but is it actually proper to go in and extinguish a life-form found in only one place?

Political Collapse
Judgmental Society
 * Cure tech:  Distributed Thought
 * Commentary:  This has a lot of good and a lot of bad.  Distributed thought systems are a Beyonder-managed hyperspace cognition link which can be installed across a planet to ensure that technical workers are smarter on their jobs than off them, among other applications.  Using that to cure a judgmental society...  I can imagine a few things.  I can imagine the system robbing the thoughts of people whose judgmental tendencies make them a social liability.  I can imagine the system making everyone smarter when they're working on cultural goods and stupider when they're enjoying them.  That would make the local critics easier to satisfy while simultaneously making appealing to distant critics easier.  This definitely does sound like a shift that fits within the serenity of the empire, but it also suggests a certain basal stupidity being enforced on society whenever "they don't need to be smart" is true about their lives.  It could be kind of just a different misery for the smartest of that society, because although they'd be surrounded by less arbitrarily judgmental people, their fanbases become much more likely to be stupider than they are.
Religious Animosity:
 * Cure tech:  Subconscious Education
 * Commentary:  This is a game about being an alien invader.  The Viceroy is an emissary of galactic society, coming in backed by the power of the Commonwealth's navy, plus the navies of the Panarchy and participating Imperial states, for the purpose of taking over every government in the region.  At best, it's a story of being an alien uplift manager.  It's very unfortunate that people are sad about their religion, but I'm immediately unsure if alien invaders, even aliens invading for the purpose of installing benevolent uplift managers, should go about trying to fix religions.  I think this underscores the bad ethics implicit in the subconscious education technology.
Restrictive Education:
 * Cure tech:  Absolute Freedom
 * Commentary:  The panarchy might prefer that the restrictive education system stayed in place.  Absolute freedom is far into the ideology of the Commonwealth, and to the extent that strange subset educational systems might result in people thinking thoughts and bearing values well outside of the galactic norms, curing restrictive educational systems risks reducing the diversity of thought in the galaxy.  I, however, think this is one of the flaws in the ideology of the panarchy in this game, and I have no objections to this cure for this problem.
Common Culture:
 * Cure tech:  Palace of the Arts
 * Commentary:  As long as they're willing to import cultural goods in exchange for other services, I think it should be okay for some people in some regions to be content with carrying the galactic choir.  I don't think the institutional structure suggested by the palace of the arts technology would have any great evil itself, but it doesn't seem right to try to 'cure' a common culture.
Culture of Bribery:
 * Cure tech:  Enlightened Policing
 * Commentary:  No objections.
Determinist Culture:
 * Cure tech:  Eternal Bank Tower
 * Commentary:  I'm not sure how the cure technology in this case can do anything about a determinist culture.  I would object that philosophical diversity makes this something that shouldn't be cured, but determinism in this case is being described as learned helplessness, ie depression.
Civil Unrest:
 * Cure tech:  Local Government
 * Commentary:  If it isn't making people less happy, the same complaint applies to fixing Civil Unrest (a Base Culture penalty) as applies to fixing Common Culture... although it may be slightly weaker in this place, since factionalized groups can be demanding on others in a way that doesn't apply to the blandeur of a common culture.  Also, the cure tech is very basic.  It makes sense that if you're equipped for specific areas in the region to develop their own government, people will naturally tend to segregate the more stressful and annoying conflictants into district theming decisions.  Implement slowly?
History of Horrors:
 * Cure tech:  Nationalist Indoctrination
 * Commentary:  Don't fix this.  Work around it.  The galaxy doesn't need nationalists taking pride in a history already rooted in horror.  The region's antinationalism isn't even making people unhappy, it's just making galactic society look away from them a bit.  Moderating the attention of an active and populous galaxy could be a positive relief.
Incompetent Regime:
 * Cure tech:  Panarchic Capital
 * Commentary:  Hm.  I can see the applicability of galactic bureaucratic structures for attracting a level of talent from across the galaxy which could obliterate an incompetent regime by ambient competency, but I do have a certain aversion to the Panarchy's tolerance for declaring everywhere the capital of everywhere.  Must every planet *truly* be the center of the universe?
