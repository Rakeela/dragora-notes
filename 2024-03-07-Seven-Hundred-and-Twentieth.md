5:31.  Day two without carbamazepine.  I can't sleep, because I'm being bothered by an electronic whine.  To no surprise, I discovered that it's still there if I step outside, though to discover that I first had to get dressed.

6:47.  612 words.

10:57.  2,821 words.  2,209 words of progress.  It's such a relief to work on a new project!

13:02.  4,108 words.  Also, 1,450 words on the file previously at 1,416 words.  That's 34 words of worldbuilding, and 3,496 words of writing.

13:44.  4,542.  3,930 words of writing.  Stalled.

14:14.  5,176.

17:24.  I got totally absorbed in The Viceroy when I was supposed to be running my Hc Svnt Dracones session.  Nobody seems to have noticed I was gone because the rest of the group didn't cohere in my absence.  I feel like if I'd stuck around pestering people, it would've come together.

17:27.  That game session totally obliterated my mental context, taking my head from full and creative to empty.

17:44.  I feel dissatisfied and unproductive.  There's so many things I have to read.  I have to get through them to be productive.  I don't want to read.  When I don't want to read, how can I work?

17:49.  Am I sleepy or something?  My eyes kinda hurt, and I'm brain-fogged.  All I can think about right now is basic pleasure, and even that produces a disinterested response.

21:05.  5,176.

21:58.  6,038.  5,424 words of progress.

22:03.  I think that's enough for today.
