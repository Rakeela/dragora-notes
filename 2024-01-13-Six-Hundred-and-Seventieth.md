13:24.  My weight is considerably increased.  I've been psychologically incapable of fasting for quite a while now.  The voices in my head sabotaged my old fasting patterns by relentlessly criticizing them as inadequate.  When my morale to fast was broken, I fasted dramatically more inadequately.  While I had confidence in my fasting, it actually worked.  Frankly, I suspect there's a mindrape program that did it on purpose, intentionally sabotaging my will to fast so that I would gain weight again.  If the voices had never criticized my fasting, I see no reason to believe I would've fasted less.

13:49.  335.

13:59.  The voices also sabotaged me by telling me that hard liquor doesn't break fasts.

Before they told me that, I never drank while fasting.
