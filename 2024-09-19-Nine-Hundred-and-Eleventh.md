7:49.  I have been so tired lately.  It's affecting my writing.  I'm not producing a good sensorium for my characters to inhabit.  44,196.

8:53.  44,802.  Taking a break.

10:50.  Okay.  Back to work.  I played Nationstates.  I worked a bit on my kobold simulator.

12:31.  45,593.  1,397 words of progress.  This is such a terrible slice of life story.  Nothing happens.

19:01.  46,914.  2,718 words of progress.  Argh!  I put in the hours, but I didn't get the word count.

19:17.  Ugh.  I'm bored.

19:36.  I'm reading Stone and Paintings.  I actually really like this book.

20:08.  I'm at 60% in rereading Stone and Paintings.  I found a few more corrections, including to one really clunky bit of text.
