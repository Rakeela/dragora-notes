6:27.  I woke up at about 5:40 and am only just getting my first time point recorded.

7:57.  I've finished my morning stuff, but I'm going to go to the store and back before getting started on work stuff.  I don't get moving quickly in the morning...  it's a little disappointing that I've been up since 5:40 and this (7:57) is when I'm done with the stuff I do every morning.

10:46.  I played Cultist Simulator... for too long.  I was seized by the prospect of advancing towards the win condition I seek in the game.  I was absorbed in the juggling act of keeping my influences on the board.  I was fantasizing about the extremes of Moth influence.  I longed to paint with the Moth 15 influence, "That Old Yearning".  It's the only one with an incomplete description.  It just says *please*.  I could use it for the victory condition I'm trying to achieve in-game, but that's not why I want it.  I just long to have... functional passions?  I guess I kind of do.  I spent all day yesterday from early in the morning until late in the evening working on the tasks I set for myself.  But now today I've spent two hours playing Cultist Simulator!  No, checking chat logs... one hour.  Hm.  Still, it feels like a breach in my passions.  A wound.

10:52.  I feel like my emotions aren't so fervent.  It's not that I don't have them, absolutely not.  I am happy sometimes, miserable sometimes.  Often.  But in Cultist Simulator, emotions are the fuel of painting well.  You pour your passions into your painting and you get a quality count that is generally correlated with the passion you put into it.  Of course, if you produce excess quality, you get a Fascination marker, and your rewards don't actually get better...  As though the extremely invested painter were believing in their own masterpieces rather than producing actual masterpieces.

11:21.  82,577.  Not sure where I'll get wordcount from here on out.  I maaaay just publish this book a bit shorter than the others.

12:06.  82,840.  Credit 3,797 words of editing.  263 words of progress.  Hm.  Making quota today may not be feasible.

12:36.  82,856.  Appending something to my records for preservation before I delete it from the draft:  **(DRAFT NOTE: This is not the final draft.  The distances in this journey are much, much too small.  The journey by wing from Oriaryo to Skrend should take four days and expect to arrive at midday.  The journey from Griolor to Asere should take two days and arrive in the afternoon; this doesn’t need to change, as having Taltios fly ahead on the morning of the second day is still appropriate.  The journey from Asere to Oriaryo should take two days and arrive in the evening; the berserk rush of the flying express boat should take two days and arrive in the morning.  The journey on foot from Oriaryo to Skrend should take sixty six days and arrive in the afternoon.  The Skrendian forest alone takes nine days to cross from Kwivray’s Temple to Skrend.  From here on out, I’m going to try to write with the appropriate distances.)**  82,707.  Shame that erodes my daily wordcount, but it certainly has no place in the final work.  If I credit what I wrote before (279 words), I could use this point to retrench my word count and start continuing the count from 82,707.

12:48.  82,796.  89 words of progress.  368.  Credit 3,661 words of editing.  Even when I'm trying to extend the text rather than abbreviate it, it's hard to gain length while editing.

12:58.  Ugh.  I'm very tired.  I thought I could put the treadmill away and keep working, but I'm still tired.  I'm taking a break - properly, as opposed to by sitting here spacing out and rubbing my eyes.

13:48.  I watched another stream of the Goodbye Volcano High demo.  2023 most anticipated title (to me).
