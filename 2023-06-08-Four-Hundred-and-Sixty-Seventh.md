05:34.  Just got up.  I decided to record my first time point promptly this time, or "promptly" as it were.  I woke up at 05:27, what felt like a few minutes after I checked my watch and discovered it was 04:11.

05:37.  I woke up with leg pain, so today is not a day for the treadmill.  It feels like muscle soreness.

07:26.  I just flossed.  The dentist (and the staff thereof) always bugs me to floss more.  Last time I was at the dentist, I got quizzed by the hygienist about how frequently I brushed.  "Once a week, twice a week?" asked the hygienist.  I said, "Twice a month?"  She said something like 'props for honesty', but I wonder if that estimate of mine was accurate.  If I recorded every time I floss in my records, would it be even twice a month, or would it be rarer than that?

08:40.  I got up early, but I have not gotten to work in any timely manner.  I am not sure I will today.  I mean, it seems likely, but meh.  Two energy drinks in, and I'm tired.  Achy.

08:56.  70,566 words on the file.  0 words on the chapter.  Ugh.  Part of the problem is that the next thing which needs to be done is...  I mean...  the story is not shaping up the way I want it to.  I have 19.5k words of the intended 90k to resolve a plotline that took 60k words to set up.

09:36.  Now that Kura and Kaire are interacting, I want the next chapter to somehow be a Kura chapter from the first paragraph.

11:38.  71,369.  811 words on the chapter.

15:05.  71,556.  998 words on the chapter.  Ugh.  I've been distracted.  And I've overeaten.  Overeating affects my productivity worse than staying up late.  Eating one meal a day has been good for my writing productivity...

15:26.  Including Oreos in my candy vault was such a mistake.  They're so inferior.

17:56.  It was... really unproductive, but...  I greatly enjoyed today as a feast day.  Every time my stomach settled I ate more.  Now my stomach has settled again, and I haven't eaten more.  In a few minutes, I should be able to get back to writing again.
