# Concept Substructuring

As information accumulates within this [[concept-map]], it also forms shapes and patterns.  It's almost neuron-like as the map is browsed to observe its connectivity.  Some nodes are unidirectional; others are bidirectional.  Some nodes appear to operate as inputs or outputs.  Some nodes are common conduits.  This is in the first place an emergent behavior being observed.  Having observed it, deliberate structuring may at some point be useful in order to create distinct thoughtspaces subordinate to the whole.  For instance, I could put a specific project into the map, deliberately gating connectivity to it through intermediate nodes, thereby ensuring that it has a separated presence without getting tangled in the central cluster that has been developing.
