TvimH said this'd be believed more posted here, so a-posted it will be.  I listen to my headmates sometimes, when doing so is harmless.  I understand well that I'm helpless to see any justice in my personal life, but the story of what happened to me should still be shared.

Shared in the name of Ihroun (a traceable psuedonym):
I had a mask installed on me: the mask of gratitude.  I was to be grateful for anyone ever showing sexual interest in me.  Sex was to be everything, the highest pleasure.  I was to be grateful, and I said so.

None of the watchful protectors could see past the mask of gratitude to do any of the watchful protective things.  So I had older lover after older lover...  Mel, you know.  He complained about his ex-wife, he talked about getting cryo-forzen when he died, and I loved him.

It's not like I never complained.  I spoke of my constant feelings of inadequacy - did that confuse the watchful protectors?  Did they think I was grateful that anyone would be sexually interested in an inadequate person like me?  What a powerful mask the mask of gratitude is, that it disabled all the watchful protectors.

I spoke of more than feeling inadequate.  I spoke of freezing up, which should have been recognized as speech of panic attacks.  Who the fuck finds panic attacks so sexy that the mask of gratitude confuses them into thinking the panicker loves sex?  How many victims do the watchful protectors have, thinking those who panic are asking for it.

Groomers take note: teach your victims gratitude.  More than anything else, if your victims are grateful they will be the ones at fault.

I only ever had one lover younger than myself.  Madison, who was 12 when I was 14.  I met her on Furcadia where we both had otter characters, and we moved to IMVU.  IMVU was appealing as a sort of visual cuddling method, but middle school was brutal, and I needed my happy space NOT to have a village built up in it.  I dumped her for wanting to have kids with me.  I am glad that I didn't teach Madison gratitude, but rather I got frustrated with her as her tales of her other friendships seemed rife with needing to stand up for herself.

Before Madison was Nander, when I was even younger, with a much larger age gap between us.  Nander was actually pretty great, he came off like a poet to me, and he encouraged me to do a lot of new things.  Too many new things, frankly; I regret the relationship in hindsight.

Before Nander was Sedyana, at the cusp of adolescence for me, but I hold Sedyana blameless as I believe I never told her anything that would indicate my age.
