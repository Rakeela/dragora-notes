(Commentary: I'm going to get in trouble for not taking notes this quarter at some point.  This teacher works too exactly from the book and I forgot my computer today.)

Alkanes w/ 1-4 carbons are gases at room temperature.  They're often used as fuels.

Alkanes w/ 5-8 carbons are liquids at room temperature.  They're often used as fuels.

Alkanes w/ 9-17 carbons are liquids at room temperature.  Examples include motor oil, kerosene, and jet fuel.

Alkanes w/ 17+ carbons are solids at room temperature.  They're known as parafins.

Alkanes have the lowest melting and boiling points of organic chemicals.  They are only nonpolar and have only weak dispersion forces.  Dispersion forces are more technically known as "London dispersion forces".  Dispersion forces increase with carbon chain length.

Branched isomers have lower boiling points and are more compact.  Their nonlinear shape cannot line up as smoothly, reducing their dispersion forces.

Cycloalkanes have higher boilint points.  Their close-stacking shapes have many points of contact, promoting (relatively) strong dispersion forces.

Crude oil is distilled and sorted in cooling towers as different hydrocarbons separate at different temperatures.  Vaporized hydrocarbons rise up the distilling tower and are extracted at the level matching their condensation temperature.

Alkanes have strong, non-reactive C-C bonds, making them non-reactive.  However, they combust readily in oxygen.  They are insoluble in water.

In organic molecules, C atoms form bonds with H, C, O, S, N, P, and halogens F, Cl, and Br.

(Commentary:  There was a table here giving attributes of the different elements by group, but I didn't get it copied fast enough.)

(Commentary:  I originally wrote these in a notebook that isn't primarily FOR chemistry.  I transcribed them on the subsequent Sunday.)
