I'm an artist.  Whatever else I am, I'm an artist.  Always.  Beauty is meaning in life, and [[art]] is the construction of beauty.  I'm not a skilled or popular artist, but it's only incidentally a social activity.  I make art for myself.  I would continue making art if I had no external interactions whatsoever.  I consider making art essential to being an [[immortalist]], in fact.  I don't believe that people can have an immortal psychology if they can't make their own art.

I make [[abstract-art]], mostly.  It's a release valve.  I have more artistic desire than I have artistic skill.  I must be an artist; I can't be an artist.  I don't know how to make art.  Well, I can make tons of interesting patterns.  My interest is easily caught by small details in shapes created mostly by applying filters and noise.  I like it when the sharpen tool makes patterns jump out of other algorithmic transformation, too.  The XOR effect amuses me, and many other minor discoveries.  Every so often my methods turn up something really stunning.

I have a modest production of [[music]].  I like listening to the same things so much, for such extended durations, that I find it hard to be motivated to make more music.  I haven't produced an album worth of content yet, much less a coherent album worth of content.  I can listen to the same track for hours and hours if I like it, and I can listen to the same track that long on many days.  This impairs my actual musical productivity, though I look forward to making a few albums across the next several centuries.

I produce a lot of [[stories]].  I always have.  I consider writing a form of art as well.  This got pretty weird for me with past coercions and subsequent privacy violations to find out what I was "concealing"...  Yuck.  When I wasn't willing to produce the porn that the stalkertrash set demanded, they ripped through my private files in desperation.  They did find a lot of content that I never published to them when they were asking for it, but missed the part where I spent years hunting for ways to make people notice the mediocrity in a sexually-fixated life.  I've written a lot of sad whore characters over the years for the benefit of people who apparently believed I was writing about god's holy paradise for the faithful... pardon my frustration.  Obligatory sexuality is NOT empowering, but the kind of people who rip apart privacy in fear of the perfect lure of sexual hedonism seem to be themselves the population that would migrate to the pornoverse if they could, since they're the ones who want it too badly to recognize it as a form of mediocre life history.

Finally, I believe that rhetoric and ideology are artforms, but I am not sure they have quite the same role as the others have.  I don't know if they're a helpful part of the immortalist psychology in the same way.  So many people use rhetoric and ideology to fuel hatred and war, that I can't in good conscience encourage their study.
