One of my old pain relief strategies was 'channeled arousal'.  Being aroused increases pain tolerance.  Pain is unsexy to me, but by force of will I could push past that.  Needing a lot of pain relief is part of how I got in trouble; it's part of why I spent a lot more time on (cyber)sex than I actually wanted to spend.

I don't know why people found that unthinkable.  Pain can coerce people into doing a lot of things.  It gave me an incentive to go along with anything.  Not a strong enough one, ultimately; I didn't have a sustainable emotional environment to go along with it.

I'm thinking about it today because ow.  Naproxen and acetominophen together are not providing enough pain relief.
