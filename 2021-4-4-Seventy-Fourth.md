One of my old pain relief strategies was 'channeled arousal'.  Being aroused increases pain tolerance.  Pain is unsexy to me, but by force of will I could push past that.  Needing a lot of pain relief is part of how I got in trouble; it's part of why I spent a lot more time on (cyber)sex than I actually wanted to spend.

I don't know why people found that unthinkable.  Pain can coerce people into doing a lot of things.  It gave me an incentive to go along with anything.  Not a strong enough one, ultimately; I didn't have a sustainable emotional environment to go along with it.

I'm thinking about it today because ow.  Naproxen and acetominophen together are not providing enough pain relief.

I completed a twenty four hour fast today, then I ate two and a half donuts.  Tonight's dinner?  Pizza.  I wonder if someday I'll be skinny and people will wonder how I can eat the way I do without getting fat.  I'll have a real answer, not just 'lucky metabolism', because I'll be able to say, "It's because I only eat like this twice a week."  My metabolism is actually slow!

I also just ate a durian mung bean cake for the first time.  I like durian, and I like mung bean, so I thought it'd be great!  Unfortunately, there's an *off* note in the flavor of durian, which the mung bean accentuated beyond tolerance.  I found the combo gross.  I have three more durian mung bean cakes.  I feel bad about throwing away a food that traveled all the way from Vietnam to get here, but bleh.  I don't think I want to eat the others, and I'm the only person I know who likes durian.  They're likely to just get discarded.

Next week is a week of Huel.  Eating Huel is kind of demoralizing, but I seem to lose weight almost as well while eating Huel as while eating nothing, without having to go hungry.

In other trivia, I've found that at its lowest setting, I can use my motorized standing desk while sitting on the floor.  I like this desk.  My life is full of petty luxuries that can't make up for living in pain.

...seriously, I don't understand why I got so little understanding of the idea of using arousal to manage pain.  Like there are reasons people do things.  Treating me as lonely or boredom-prone was both abusive and deluded; I'm happily married!  I was even in a polyamorous relationship.  Like one of the mistakes I made in that relationship was believing Jacel when sie said, "Don't do anything that hurts you."  Which had me step *back* sexuality, because if I was *safe*, I was often more interested in just thinking and hurting rather than pushing myself to engage and service others.

Channeling arousal and edging myself for hours was a way for me to be "productive".  When I thought I was loved, I didn't want to do that, the way I don't do it for Kistaro.  I've never done that for Kistaro.  Kistaro loves me.

If I'd been treated with more empathy, I would've gotten to a better place in my life with way less suffering on the part of others, yet though I committed no offense against the rights of others, people preferred to wreck themselves in hatred rather than try to fix problems with kindness.  They projected sociopathy at me while behaving in a shamelessly sociopathic manner.  People who behaved with shocking abusiveness and dishonesty to me lauded themselves as honest, virtuous, and "reciprocating hatred"..?  I've been dedicated to a "save all lives" position since I was like 11.  "This world is made for LOVE AND PEACE!", y'know?  Trigun is still my favorite anime after all these years.

I wanted to make transhuman connections.  Mel told me I should be bonobian for futurism.  He didn't live up to that.

I think pain management may describe some "sex-obsessed" men, and social obligation may describe some of others.  Would we even know?  Hatred of men for being sluts is so ubiquitous in our society that trying to help any man who has ever expressed a libido is utterly forbidden.  When people break themselves in stagnant obedience to hatred, what they're really enforcing is a taboo against actually fixing the problems that hurt them.  Asking the "sex-obsessed" for their side of the story is seen as some kind of endorsement of rape culture.

Yet in my case, the real rape culture was made of the people who enforce that taboo.  I had to service people, I was disposable when people got bored of me, and nobody cared if I got hurt meeting their needs.  I was taught mangled social lessons, punished when I didn't conform, and rejected as a sexual predator when I preferred basic asexuality.  How many men are like me and not having their story heard, because society's prejudices make listening to them forbidden?  I don't know.  All I know is the power of the taboo that was brandished to keep me from having *my* story heard.

We need better medicine.  Persistent inflammation creates a lot of pain.  Immunotherapies can help people with persistent inflammation problems.  If we can't *talk to* men who suffer chronic pain and use sexuality to limit it, if that taboo is too strong to challenge, maybe new therapies can be invented which will sidestep the taboo by helping *mutely*.  That's something I hope can be advanced with new dendritic cell therapies.

Or you know, we can just embrace sociopathy and punishment forever, whee stagnation and hatred, such LIBERATION!  Who needs science, justice, or tolerance when society permits us to hate the suffering and blame the victims?

Liberalism got shived by "liberals", but it didn't get shived by liberals.
