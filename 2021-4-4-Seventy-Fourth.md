One of my old pain relief strategies was 'channeled arousal'.  Being aroused increases pain tolerance.  Pain is unsexy to me, but by force of will I could push past that.  Needing a lot of pain relief is part of how I got in trouble; it's part of why I spent a lot more time on (cyber)sex than I actually wanted to spend.

I don't know why people found that unthinkable.  Pain can coerce people into doing a lot of things.  It gave me an incentive to go along with anything.  Not a strong enough one, ultimately; I didn't have a sustainable emotional environment to go along with it.

I'm thinking about it today because ow.  Naproxen and acetominophen together are not providing enough pain relief.

I completed a twenty four hour fast today, then I ate two and a half donuts.  Tonight's dinner?  Pizza.  I wonder if someday I'll be skinny and people will wonder how I can eat the way I do without getting fat.  I'll have a real answer, not just 'lucky metabolism', because I'll be able to say, "It's because I only eat like this twice a week."  My metabolism is actually slow!

I also just ate a durian mung bean cake for the first time.  I like durian, and I like mung bean, so I thought it'd be great!  Unfortunately, there's an *off* note in the flavor of durian, which the mung bean accentuated beyond tolerance.  I found the combo gross.  I have three more durian mung bean cakes.  I feel bad about throwing away a food that traveled all the way from Vietnam to get here, but bleh.  I don't think I want to eat the others, and I'm the only person I know who likes durian.  They're likely to just get discarded.

Next week is a week of Huel.  Eating Huel is kind of demoralizing, but I seem to lose weight almost as well while eating Huel as while eating nothing, without having to go hungry.

In other trivia, I've found that at its lowest setting, I can use my motorized standing desk while sitting on the floor.  I like this desk.  My life is full of petty luxuries that can't make up for living in pain.
