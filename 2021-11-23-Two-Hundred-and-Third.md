I'm reading the book "Dialogue: The Art of Verbal Action For The Page, Stage, and Screen" by Robert McKee (or perhaps by ROBERT MCKEE, given that the name is typeset larger than any of the rest of what's on the front of the book), and on page 67 it has praise for an improv scene in Forrest Gump.  That movie is such a classic!  I love being reminded of it.  So far.  Now that I've said that, someone in my denied-to-exist hatedom will desperately immiserate themselves trying to find a way to hurt me with it, because they're miserably hateful people who do that kind of thing, but hey.  Forrest Gump is a classic movie that I highly recommend.

I don't recommend a lot of movies, but mind you that doesn't mean my recommendations are any better for the scarcity.  I've no practice and I'm out of date.  C'est la vie!  I recommend Forrest Gump (1994) all the same.

The voices in my head love chyawanprash.  That's a very abnormal recommendation to give, but I'm noting it here anyways, because I'm going to go buy another can.  I think I go through one can per month, but by noting it here, I'll find out how long the next can lasts.
