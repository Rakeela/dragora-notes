Morning Weigh-in:  249.1 pounds

I ate another .54 pounds of fava bean salad.  Same size container as last time, but it rang up as weighing more this time.  It's a salad of fava beans, garbanzo beans, and tomato wedges.  I'm amazed by how little food is half a pound.  If I keep to small amounts of food like that, I'm sure to lose weight.

Sometimes, Kistaro worries that my dieting will cause muscle wasting.  That worry makes me want alcohol more often.  One of the things that causes muscle wasting in calorie restriction is the breakdown of muscle tissue for amino acids that are processed by the liver into glucose.  Alcohol interferes with the liver's production of glucose from amino acids.  I wish I knew the optimal rate at which to consume alcohol in order to impair gluconeogenesis with a minimum of side effects.

Food is a ravage.  Misery drives me towards it, but misery is all I get from it.  How unproductive!  I don't feel bad about the fava bean salad, that's both delicious and nutritious.  Yet I am surrounded by less healthy options.  Then too, even more of the fava bean salad would be a mistake.

I'm having trouble getting to work on writing.  Every time I think about writing, I think about not wanting to handle the difficulty in my next chapter.  Sometimes I think, "I'm sure I can handle it."  Somehow that doesn't make me want to do it.  Maybe the problem is that there's no way around it being a planning task.  I can't just write by the seat of my pants and expect to solve it... or if I can, I might require multiple attempts to complete the chapter successfully.

I'm watching a movie I never wanted to see and it turns out I was right to skip it.  That was [[Detective-Pikachu-2019]].  It wasn't a terrible movie, I just didn't enjoy it.

I think our scale broke.  I may not be able to do regular weighings for a while.

Correction, it needed new batteries.  Fixed.

Sigh.  I need to skip eating at least one day of this weekend.  It looks like my old "I can't eat enough in two days to overcome five days without" may be outdated.  I most certainly can.  I think the problem is the handpies.  I can down massive calorie counts of handpies, which means massive amounts of sugar.

I wrote up something today about the [[Carrying-Capacity-of-Earth]].

New file.  1,205 words on the file.

35,591 steps.  10.6 miles.  1,780 kcal.  7 hours, 30 minutes, and 1 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.

Phew.  Let's finally sit down.  I'll eat a handful of baked cheese and a shot of cream to celebrate, eh?  I've eaten more cheese than usual today.  I appreciated the salt of it.

I downed a handful of pecans, too.  I'm just spoiling myself tonight.
