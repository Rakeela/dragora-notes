# Existential Threat

Existential threats are a special moral category that resolves very differently from other imperatives.  An existential threat is a threat to the future existence of the individual contemplating it.  The most basic existential threat is murder, though the term is typically utilized to refer to threats to whole societies.  "X-risk" is a synonym for existential threat.

I believe that existential threat contemplation is a naturally allied cause to immortalism, as any [[immortalist]] will need to take personally all existential threats.  People who live for supremely long periods of time will necessarily be concerned for the importance of doing so sustainably.

The contemplation of existential threats should be noted to have a characteristic downside.  Since it abrogates many normal moral rules, the insistence that an existential threat exists is also an insistence that normal morality should not apply to the resolution of a question.  This problem is [[moral-hazard-of-existential-threat]].
