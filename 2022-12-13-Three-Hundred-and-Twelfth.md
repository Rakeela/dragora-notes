I'm 41 hours into a 336 hour fast.  295 hours to go!  Every hour feels like an achievement.  I shed a surprising amount of weight (five pounds) on day one.  I know what that was: my body was burning through my glycogen reserves.  Weight will be lost more slowly once fat stores are being burnt instead, because fat has a lower water content.

I played a bit more Star Traders: Frontiers.  I've built up my captain in that file to be untouchable.  Every faction regards him as a hero simultaneously.  He's a spy!  Who loves a spy?  Well he's not just a spy.  He also runs a traveling hospital so impressive it can provide medical services on almost any world in the game.  What is he doing?  Providing top-end medical services to elites and politically valuable people?

I've reduced the gameplay to travel around while numbers increase.  There's nothing to do with money after a few million.  The potential dramas of a hospital ship are left entirely to imagination, abstracted away to just +2-4 reputation points per landing.  Every NPC encounter can be resolved by retreating peacefully except for xeno encounters, which require Skip Off the Void (and a quick pitstop for repairs).  The gamestate represents a very successful pacifist run.  The gradually mounting difficulty level in the game is unlikely to ever matter at this rate, unless it forces two xeno encounters back-to-back.  I could play it indefinitely, but there's nothing left of the gameplay.

43 hours in.  I bought a container of brandy eggnog that I'll drink when I complete my fast.  Not the whole thing at once, obviously.  I think I'd die.  But it'll be delicious come the evening of Christmas when my fast concludes.  Longing for alcoholic eggnog was actually the motive for this ambitious fast.  I wanted it very badly, but it's so unhealthy.  I decided that I needed to do something impressive to earn it.  If I complete this fast, the net effect of a fast followed by drinking that alcohol should be favorable on my health.

Even with the candy I've bought for the 25th.  I found new candy that I haven't eaten!  It seems like there's always something new.  There are some chocolate mint cakes that I hope will be available later in the month, too.  They'd go stale if I bought them now.

44 hours.  Every hour feels like an achievement.  I'm going to go to the store and buy some mushrooms.  They're zero calorie!
