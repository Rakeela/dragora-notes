I'm 41 hours into a 336 hour fast.  295 hours to go!  Every hour feels like an achievement.  I shed a surprising amount of weight (five pounds) on day one.  I know what that was: my body was burning through my glycogen reserves.  Weight will be lost more slowly once fat stores are being burnt instead, because fat has a lower water content.

I played a bit more Star Traders: Frontiers.  I've built up my captain in that file to be untouchable.  Every faction regards him as a hero simultaneously.  He's a spy!  Who loves a spy?  Well he's not just a spy.  He also runs a traveling hospital so impressive it can provide medical services on almost any world in the game.  What is he doing?  Providing top-end medical services to elites and politically valuable people?

I've reduced the gameplay to travel around while numbers increase.  There's nothing to do with money after a few million.  The potential dramas of a hospital ship are left entirely to imagination, abstracted away to just +2-4 reputation points per landing.  Every NPC encounter can be resolved by retreating peacefully except for xeno encounters, which require Skip Off the Void (and a quick pitstop for repairs).  The gamestate represents a very successful pacifist run.  The gradually mounting difficulty level in the game is unlikely to ever matter at this rate, unless it forces two xeno encounters back-to-back.  I could play it indefinitely, but there's nothing left of the gameplay.

43 hours in.  I bought a container of brandy eggnog that I'll drink when I complete my fast.  Not the whole thing at once, obviously.  I think I'd die.  But it'll be delicious come the evening of Christmas when my fast concludes.  Longing for alcoholic eggnog was actually the motive for this ambitious fast.  I wanted it very badly, but it's so unhealthy.  I decided that I needed to do something impressive to earn it.  If I complete this fast, the net effect of a fast followed by drinking that alcohol should be favorable on my health.

Even with the candy I've bought for the 25th.  I found new candy that I haven't eaten!  It seems like there's always something new.  There are some chocolate mint cakes that I hope will be available later in the month, too.  They'd go stale if I bought them now.

332 words of progress.  421 words remaining.  Ugh.  It's slow going today.

664 words of progress.  89 words remaining.

1,082 words of progress.  329 words over quota.  I'm going to mark it.  Further progress will be another session of writing.

44 hours.  Every hour feels like an achievement.  I'm going to go to the store and buy some mushrooms.  They're zero calorie!

46 hours.  I know, I said "every hour feels like an achievement" twice, but it does.  In fact, that's three times.  I'm sure I'll get sick of checking constantly how many hours it's been, but I was sure I'd stop counting words per day, and I was sure I'd stop naming these day logs by date and count, too.  Maybe I'll just keep tallying hours.

48 hours.  That's two days down.  Twelve days to go.  The food obsession is maddening.  I bought more candy for myself.  I've ransacked all the grocery stores in the area for candies that I haven't eaten yet.  I've bought $60 of candies that are mostly-novel.  I have two kinds of marzipan candy, one I've had before and one I haven't.  I am ravenous for sweets.  Ravenous!

There are no grocery stores in the area that I haven't visited to look for new sweets.  Tomorrow, I will have to satisfy myself by counting my sweets.  I may tally them in tomorrow's day log just to have something to do.

49 hours.  I went to bed early last night because I couldn't bear to be awake anymore.  The sleeping hours are the best.

51 hours.  I pawed through my candy stash again.  So much beautiful chocolate.  I even have ruby chocolate.  What does that taste like?  Berry delicious, according to the wrapper.
