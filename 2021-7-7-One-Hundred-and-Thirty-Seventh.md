Liberalism thrives in light.  An openly operating surveillance system tends to become narrowly defined, and a narrowly defined surveillance system is one that punishes only crime.  When crime is well-guarded against, people do not evince the conservative drift that occurs when people get victimized by criminals.  Expecting that society protects their rights, they do whatever they want with their life.

Concealed surveillance systems do not tend liberal.  Consider the classical conservative judgmental community... and look at the Arab world, where liberal activists get murdered.
