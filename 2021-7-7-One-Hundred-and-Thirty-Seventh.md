Liberalism thrives in light.  An openly operating surveillance system tends to become narrowly defined, and a narrowly defined surveillance system is one that punishes only crime.  When crime is well-guarded against, people do not evince the conservative drift that occurs when people get victimized by criminals.  Expecting that society protects their rights, they do whatever they want with their life.

Concealed surveillance systems do not tend liberal.  Consider the classical conservative judgmental community... and look at the Arab world, where liberal activists get murdered.

I've been exercising more lately!  Daily cross-town scooter usage.  I've also bought a walking treadmill and I've converted my standing desk to a treadmill desk.

I'm going to go visit a soup kitchen this evening and ask about volunteering opportunities.  I may do Kairn's thing after all, too; I was thinking today that I miss hymns.

Would it be possible to cure Crohn's Disease by producing a vaccine for the biofilm characteristic to its pathogenicity?  If the immune system could competently break up those biofilms, the gut would be less hospitable to the lingering accumulations of microbes which bring on symptoms in Crohn's.

Investigating the gut-adhesion properties of blastocystis may also be relevant.  Eliminating undesirable microbial stickiness in the gut could achieve therapeutic ends in both disorders.  This path of investigation could also lead to non-vaccine treatments based upon the chemistry involved, which could be suitable for more conventional drug therapies.
