#2021-11-4-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Third

I forgot to weigh myself yesterday, but a 1:46 AM weighing yielded the result of 216.9 pounds.  I'm still well-hydrated, and I believe this sets a new low mark.  I want to weigh less than 200 pounds someday!

In about twelve hours, I intend to eat... another piece of candy.  Not from my hoard this time though, today I'll eat some chocolate mint yogurt.  I'm looking forward to it!

Oh, and I've continued drinking a Huel shake (~400 calories) per day.  My first one was a little larger than two scoops, and since then I've been adding a bit of creamer to it every day, so I think these have been ~430 calories instead.
