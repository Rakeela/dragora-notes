I forgot to weigh myself yesterday, but a 1:46 AM weighing yielded the result of 216.9 pounds.  I'm still well-hydrated, and I believe this sets a new low mark.  I want to weigh less than 200 pounds someday!

In about twelve hours, I intend to eat... another piece of candy.  Not from my hoard this time though, today I'll eat some chocolate mint yogurt.  I'm looking forward to it!

Oh, and I've continued drinking a Huel shake (~400 calories) per day.  My first one was a little larger than two scoops, and since then I've been adding a bit of creamer to it every day, so I think these have been ~430 calories instead.

Thanks, psychosis.  The presences - aka the little loops, although these were a pair of 'moderate presences' who were bugging me in particular - told me they were in contact with my stomach, and wanted to work with it on meals.  They used this to try to encourage slower eating and the discarding of some of my yogurt.

At their urging, I ate the yogurt I'd planned to eat well in advance, sort of.  I don't know where the chocolate mint variety got to.  And now I think I'm going to eat something else, just to bite back at them.  -_-

Down one Pop-Tarts Bites, "Kooky" chocolate fudge flavor.  These pouches claim to be 150 calories each.

These guys have bugged me so much about gluttony that they make me hate fasting.  Also, they recruited my stomach into that scene successfully, but that made it worse for them.  I *have* heard my stomach speak before across the brain-gut link.  It has a *very* distinctive voice, which messed up their lie.

Now they say that my stomach is bugging me by talking to them.  Okaaay?  Good for them.

Oh, but P.S.  Even though they were lying, that yogurt is staying discarded.  It should've had cookie dough bites, chocolate chips, and rice crisps in it.  It tasted like it had cookie dough bites, chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips in it.  That is so wrong.  Ingredient mismatches are revolting.  Why would rice pieces melt in the mouth with a flavor like butterscotch?

I ate a ration brick, too.  Further discussion of what my stomach likes.  To internal discomfort among the presences, as they're complaining that having just linked my stomach in to "the hive mind" is awful for them.  It only thinks about food, and doesn't have anything to do except talk.

I may take a break from my diet today.  Seriously...  I can't tell if they're ever telling the truth, but at least this time they're talking about nerves.  One of the 'major presences' claims to feel like he's getting poked when I poke at the back of my head in various ways, and I opened google images to see if I could tell one of them which scalp nerves link to him.  The greater occipital nerve is the one that seems to report to him.
