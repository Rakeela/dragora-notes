8:51.  Ugh.  I'm tempted to play Starfield this morning.  I've been awake for nearly two hours and I haven't done anything except check social media.  While feeling lonely and disconnected from people!

12:12.  i've been awake for five hours now.  I haven't played Starfield, but all I've done has been to hang around online and read a book.  It's a good book, but it makes me feel bad about my second-rate writing.

12:21.  I went to the store twice.  It's practically a second hangout.  I did that while reading my book.  So more walking, more reading, but also the spending of money.  Sigh.  I got new cookies that I've never had, and some cake things that were on clearance.  The cake things were still overprice, but it's been ages since I had overpriced petit fours, so whatever I'll try them.  Tomorrow.

14:33.  I feel intellectually flattened.  I could be doing more.  For science!

14:36.  Like, I could be reviewing my old research on immunity.  I could be trying to write essays talking about immune disorders and the potential new therapies targeting them.  I feel like I can't do that anymore.  I can't do that today.

14:58.  I fill my time with stuff that doesn't matter.  I'm harmless, but I'm not good for anything.  All I'm doing is eating sweets and losing weight.  Slowly.  It's like.  Eating sweets and losing weight is hard to do, but it's not impressive to do.  But I got so much to eat tomorrow.  Like wow.  And that's just...  I mean.  It'd satisfy me if the world were perfect, right?  If nothing needed to be improved and all needs were met, I'd be totally happy living a tiny little life.  But this world has problems.  I ought to do more.

16:58.  I know what I want to write next.  It's what I want to write, but it's no good.  I'm not actually skilled at any kind of writing other than rhetoric.  Rhetoric is horribly stressful.

17:00.  All I've got is public policy writing.  I don't even want to do the research to do it right.  There's always more research to be done in public policy.

17:02.  I could write letters!  There are important public comment things that the government looks at when making decisions.  I can write in ways that change minds.  I can be recognizably a person, making connections mind to mind.  I can change the world!  So why can't I figure out what would popularize my interests on social media?

17:07.  I've drank twice what I usually do today, and I'm considering making it thrice.  I just can't do anything.  I had an awesome dream last night.  I need to write.  Writing is all I've got.  I need to self-promote.  I can't self-promote.

17:09.  I'm not drinking more right now.  I've had enough.  I'm just...  at a loss.  I can't give up draconity for any earthly reward.  Draconity doesn't pay.  Hello, integrity.

17:24.  I'm just... eating sweets... and losing weight...  That's all I can do.  I'm a crippled mutant.

18:13.  To be clear, I'm not eating anything today.  Today is a skip day.  Eating every 28 hours designates a day of skipping eating every...  fourth day?  If I eat at 8 one day, I'll eat essentially five hours later the next day, accounting for the time it takes me to be satisfied that I'm done eating.  That's 8, 13, 18, 23.  The 23 is the skip day, and then the cycle starts over at 8 again.

18:48.  I always think, oh, I have to eat less.  And yet I just keep buying more and more food.  I have stuff to eat tomorrow that I want to have a crack at while it's reasonably fresh.

19:05.  55,798.  Yesterday's concluding tally was 55,708.  I've had a hard time making myself write today.

20:17.  56,889.  1,181 words of progress.

20:36.  57,274.  1,566 words of progress.  There!  I have made quota.  Considering I have felt terrible all day, I am going to release myself from the work and not try to maximize my progress tonight.
