9:43.  This morning sucked.  I would've gotten up faster if I'd suffered less MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS with getting up.  Now I look out the window and discover a suspicious vehicle that I thought had moved on.  It's this truck that someone leaves parked out there in the guest space.  There's a sticker on it that says "UNEMPLOYED" as if anyone would actually put that on their vehicle.  Given the elevated rate of crimes targeting the unemployed, that's like sticking a kick-me sign onto a vehicle, and that makes me suspicious that the vehicle as a whole is being used in a hostile manner.  I feel like it's not a coincidence that I posted about being unproductive due to madness yesterday and that vehicle showed up here again today.
