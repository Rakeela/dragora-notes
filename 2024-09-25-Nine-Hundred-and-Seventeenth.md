9:16.

9:20.  62,881.

9:38.  I'm a hedonist and an asexual.  The stock hedonism that conservative imbeciles argue against presumes that "hedonism" means sexual excess.  I'm a hedonist who doesn't drink much and who doesn't do any drugs.  The stock hedonism that conservative imbeciles argue against presumes that "hedonism" means intoxication-seeking.  Hedonism means doing what feels good.  These things that feel good to conservative imbeciles do not feel good to everyone, and they have consequences that do not feel good even to the conservative imbeciles who require all of society to weigh in against them lest the conservative imbeciles become total wastrels.  I think conservative imbeciles are afraid of their own badly repressed and wholly uncultivated hedonistic urges, not actual philosophical hedonism, which doesn't bar much of anything valuable.

9:40.  It took me two minutes to write the above.

9:41.  Hypothetically, a self-righteous person who felt very, very good about their ethics would be expressing hedonism by acting accordingly to their ethics.  They would be gaining pleasure by it - they would be feeling good.  This is valid hedonism even if their ethics are starchly opposed to "hedonism".

9:42.  The above took one minute.

10:08.  63,059.  I'm so unfocused.  It's hard to control my tendency to drift in attention right now.

13:00.  I am disappointed there is no achievement in Old World for founding all the faiths in one civilization.

13:36.  Democratic Socialism Simulator has made me a lot fonder of taxes and the IRS.

13:38.  63,059.  Back to work.

16:56.  63,212.  Argh.  I worked briefly and then got distracted.

19:39.  I've been roleplaying for hours.  63,212.  You see!  No progress.
