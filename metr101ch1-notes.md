# Metr101Ch1 Notes

If I've taken notes on this chapter, I did so in a disorganized form.  I was surprised to do rather poorly on a practice quiz, so I've opened this file.  If there's a --- divider immediately after this preface, that means I dredged up material from elsewhere in rescuing the organization of my notes.

I've decided that I should read through the chapter again, and I've noticed something about my own experience typing up my thoughts: I quite enjoy it.  I think I can use that to improve my natural interest in the textbook by writing up impressions of it, even if my thoughts are beyond the probable test surface for the course.

For instance, right at the start of the first chapter there is a boxed section on the second page speaking of the old proverb, "Red sky at morning, sailors take warning.  Red sky at night, sailor's delight."  It presents this in a context that speaks of how our modern understanding of the atmosphere and how it produces weather is based on the scientific method.  The proverb is given as an example of something useful, but not scientific.  The rest of the section goes on to boosterize the connection between science and meteorology, praising avenues of investigation which are being pursued.  Finally, at the very bottom right of the boxed section, it says, 'Could the scientific method be used to verify the old proverb: "Red sky at morning, sailors take warning; Red sky at night sailors delight."'

That caught my attention.  An increasingly complex series of "of course" and "not technically" answers occurred to me.  I think my favorite of them was this, "If you define outcome categories and the correlation between those outcome categories and the presence or absence of red skies during the period indicated in the proverb, it should be possible to give it a scientific validation or invalidation of the same approximate precision as the proverb itself in one trial.  It would be difficult to compare studies of this nature unless they were arbitrarily standardized, but both arbitrary standardization and projection of probabilities over slightly different categories of outcome and observation times are possible to reconcile that.  With enough testing, the presence or absence of 'redness' at different times of day could be added to weather prediction methods with a quantifiable predictive value, substantially exceeding the original proverb."

As the winning sentiment, this one also got saved as an engrammatic indicator and then burnished upon elaboration.  Imagining possible probability spectra is fun.

Albedo is reflected percentage, not absorbed percentage.

Earth is closer to the sun in January than in July.  The northern hemisphere experiences winter at perihelion, the southern winter experiences winter at aphelion.

Wool fleeced from stray thoughts: "We've got four sealed greenhouses here experimenting with plant cultivars under hypoxic conditions hoping to turn up genes for exceptional performance under hypoxic conditions.  We want to check the correlation between genes favorable under hypoxic conditions with genes favorable under standard oxygenation, for potential transgenic correction should oxygen-efficient phytochemistry prove to have advantages in other conditions.  In this greenhouse we have the control group, which has been given no special treatment.  In these two we have replication groups A and B, which are operating on hypoxic conditions previously studied.  Finally, this last greenhouse is where our calculated minimum oxygenation for the present experimental group is being tested for viability and addition to existing research."

I admit to distraction, but I got this from a section in the text which spoke of early oxygen being created by sunlight splitting water molecules spontaneously into hydrogen and oxygen, as well as the possibility that early plantlife got its start in a severely hypoxic environment.  I'm a little concerned that my meteorology textbook may be upon this point outdated and in error, as I was under the impression that oxygen had entered the atmosphere via bacterial emissions.

The thought of engineering hypoxic plantlife seemed worth preserving as a terraforming thought which may also have implications for general metabolic research.

This says 50 times the atmosphere's CO2 content is locked up in the ocean.  I immediately wonder if engineering a super-heavy form of fast-replicating microbial sea life could be utilized to create a lifeform that would suck up carbon, replicate, get too dense, and fall out of the water column.  Probably a foolish thought, though algae are good experimental subjects in general for transgenic engineering at Earth's current tech level.  They're fast-growing, amenable to laboratory environments, and quite safe.

When I think about enjoying writing down my thoughts, I start thinking about this kind of stuff.  There's a lot of questions that it suggests.  What does it mean for a microbial lifeform to be heavy?  What fraction of microbes tend to float vs which ones tend to sink?  Can simple or manipulable relationships be found between floating and sinking microbes?  Are there sinking algae already?

This technique doesn't seem like it actually needs transgenic engineering, thinking about it a little more closely.  How much algae could a station in the ocean sink if it was repeatedly refertilizing and poisoning algae blooms in the same location?  If its operation locked away carbon fast enough, such a station might be valuable.  What would be the effects on ocean life upon the floor beneath the station if such a station operated?  If its operation improved sea floor ecology in a usefully controllable way, such a station might even be economical in some locations.  Conversely however, if the station's operation were deleterious to the sea floor ecology, the availability of construction sites for such a station would be greatly reduced by the need to avoid harms to economic or ecological resources.

This doesn't require the invention of new microbes, though it would require the completion of oceanographic surveys and prototype experiments to implement, with either an additional investment in automation or accounting for the wages of a manual laborer to operate the station.  It's a kind of wild algae farming for ecological purposes.
