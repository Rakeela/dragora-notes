Extreme investments in surveillance don't make people happier.  What they do is they make expressing unhappiness unsafe.  By refining the abuse of unhappy people, they are driven out of influence, entrenching the powers that made them unhappy.  In this way one of the keys to the city of Omelas is ubiquitous surveillance.

I've injured both of my achilles' tendons while using my scooter today.  I also have a bruise on my left shin, and one on my right hand from a crash a few days ago.  The scooter is fun and convenient, but it's not very safe.

I was out buying a power strip for my grow rig in my garage.  I've got it.  This gives me enough electricity access to finish building the grow rig for my [[Chives-of-Wrath]].  I should be working on that, not writing this.  But my legs hurt, and I'm extremely fatigued.  I'll get back to it soon.  Probably.

I've found a bespoke indoor garden designer.  If my attempt to build a grow rig fails completely, I may tap them.  I don't presently think I'll fail, though I do think I'll have to jury rig the lights slightly to make them work for me.  The height of my grow tower and the height of my lights is currently identical, which is nonfunctional; if I can build the grow tower slightly lower or hoist the lights slightly higher, it'll work.

I think there's a chance - small but real - that I'll found Everloathing Agritechnologies as a farm company.  I haven't done the math yet to see if the finances would work.  I don't even know where to begin on that, so I don't know how to fully estimate the chances that I'll do that.  Right now the plan is still to found it as a research company foremost, but currently I don't have supplies for obtaining viable mitochondria for transplantation.  If I managed to get my grow rig set up today, I understand I would have 61 days before the plants were ready in which to set up my second grow rig and acquire transplant supplies.  That timeline shouldn't be an issue... not least because I don't think I'll get my grow rig set up today with two injured feet.
