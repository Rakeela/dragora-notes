17.4 Chemical Properties of Triacyglycerols

Many soft margarines, stick margarines, and solid shortenings are produced by the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils.  Learning Goal: Draw the condensed or line-angle structural formula for the products of a triacyglycerol that undergoes hydrogenation, hydrolysis, or saponification.

In hydrogenation reactions, double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids react with hydrogen gas to produce carbon-carbon single bonds.  Hydrogen gas is bubbled through the heated oil typically in the presence of a nickel catalyst.

In commercial hydrogenation, the addition of hydrogen is stopped before all the double bonds in a liquid vegetable oil become completely saturated.  THe partial hydrogenation of a liquid vegetable oil changes it to a soft, semisolid fat.

What product or products are obtained from the complete hydrogenation of glyceryl trioleate?  Glyceryl tristearate.

Unsaturated fatty acids can be cis, with bulky groups on the same side of the C=C, or trans, with bulky groups on the opposite side of the C=C.

During hydrogenation, double bonds are converted to C-C single bonds.  A small number of the cis double bonds are converted to more stable trans double bonds, causing a change in the overall structure of the fatty acids.  In the body, trans fatty acids behave like saturated fatty acids.  They're estimated to be 2-4% of our total calories.  They raise LDL-cholesterol and lower HDL-cholesterol (which is not desired).

Foods containing naturally occurring trans fatty acids include milk, eggs, and beef.  Foods that contain trans fatty acids from the hydrogenation process include deep-fried foods, bread, baked goods, cookies, crackers, chips, stick and soft margarine, and vegetable shortening.

Triacylglycerols are hydrolyzed (split by water) in the presence of strong acids such as HCl or H2SO4, or digestive enzymes called lipases.  The products of ester hyderolysis are glycerol and three fatty acids.  The polar glycerol is soluble in water, but the fatty acids with their long carbon chains are not.

Saponification is the reaction of a fat with a strong base such as NaOH in the presence of heat.  It splits triacylglycerols into glycerol and the sodium salts of fatty acids.  It is the process of forming "soaps" (salts of fatty acids).  Saponification gives solid soaps that can be molded into different shapes when mixed with NaOH.  It gives softer, liquid soaps when mixed with KOH.

The chemical reactions of triacylglycerols are similar to those of alkenes and esters.  (A table is given listing esterification, hydrogenation, hydrolysis, and saponification, with further columns "organic reactants and products" and "lipid reactants and products".)  (Teacher's commentary:  This table may be an appropriate addition to the exam notes card.)
