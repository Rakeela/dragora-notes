17.4 Chemical Properties of Triacyglycerols

Many soft margarines, stick margarines, and solid shortenings are produced by the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils.  Learning Goal: Draw the condensed or line-angle structural formula for the products of a triacyglycerol that undergoes hydrogenation, hydrolysis, or saponification.

In hydrogenation reactions, double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids react with hydrogen gas to produce carbon-carbon single bonds.  Hydrogen gas is bubbled through the heated oil typically in the presence of a nickel catalyst.

In commercial hydrogenation, the addition of hydrogen is stopped before all the double bonds in a liquid vegetable oil become completely saturated.  THe partial hydrogenation of a liquid vegetable oil changes it to a soft, semisolid fat.

What product or products are obtained from the complete hydrogenation of glyceryl trioleate?  Glyceryl tristearate.

Unsaturated fatty acids can be cis, with bulky groups on the same side of the C=C, or trans, with bulky groups on the opposite side of the C=C.

During hydrogenation, double bonds are converted to C-C single bonds.  A small number of the cis double bonds are converted to more stable trans double bonds, causing a change in the overall structure of the fatty acids.  In the body, trans fatty acids behave like saturated fatty acids.  They're estimated to be 2-4% of our total calories.  They raise LDL-cholesterol and lower HDL-cholesterol (which is not desired).

Foods containing naturally occurring trans fatty acids include milk, eggs, and beef.  Foods that contain trans fatty acids from the hydrogenation process include deep-fried foods, bread, baked goods, cookies, crackers, chips, stick and soft margarine, and vegetable shortening.

Triacylglycerols are hydrolyzed (split by water) in the presence of strong acids such as HCl or H2SO4, or digestive enzymes called lipases.  The products of ester hyderolysis are glycerol and three fatty acids.  The polar glycerol is soluble in water, but the fatty acids with their long carbon chains are not.

Saponification is the reaction of a fat with a strong base such as NaOH in the presence of heat.  It splits triacylglycerols into glycerol and the sodium salts of fatty acids.  It is the process of forming "soaps" (salts of fatty acids).  Saponification gives solid soaps that can be molded into different shapes when mixed with NaOH.  It gives softer, liquid soaps when mixed with KOH.

The chemical reactions of triacylglycerols are similar to those of alkenes and esters.  (A table is given listing esterification, hydrogenation, hydrolysis, and saponification, with further columns "organic reactants and products" and "lipid reactants and products".)  (Teacher's commentary:  This table may be an appropriate addition to the exam notes card.)

17.5 Phospholipids

Phospholipids are a family of lipids similar in structure to triacylglycerols; they include glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelin.  (Three diagrams are given showing off what a triacylglycerol, a glycerophospholipid, and a sphingomyelin are structured like.  Glycerophospholipids have two fatty acids and a phosphate group linking the glycerol to an animo alcohol.  Sphingomyelins have a sphingosine backbone linking a fatty acid and a phosphate group, with the phosphate group linking to an amino alcohol.)

Glycerophospholipids contain two fatty acids that form ester bonds with the first and second hydroxyl groups of glycerol.  They also contain a hydroxyl group that forms an ester with phosphoric acid, which forms another phosphoester bond with an amino alcohol.

Sphingomyelin contains sphingosine instead of glycerol.  They contain a fatty acid, phosphate, and an amino alcohol.

Amino alcohols found in gycerophospholipids are choline, serine, and ethanolamine.  They are ionized at physiological pH of 7.4.  (Condensed structural diagrams are given for each of the three named amino alcohols.  Each one is positively charged due to an oversubscribed nitrogen molecule.) (Commentary: Ethanolamine's structure is spectacularly simple, it's ethanol + an amine group.)

Lecithin and cephalin are two types of glycerophospholipids that are abundant in brain and nerve tissues.  They are found in egg yolk, wheat germ, and yeast.  (A diagram is given illustrating the condensed structure of each molecule.) (Commentary: The difference between lecithin and cephalin is that they have choline and ethanolamine for their amino alcohols, respectively.)  (Commentary:  Or is it?  The study check reference to cephalin with serine as the amino alcohol confuses me.  What IS the difference between lecithin and cephalin?)  (Teacher's commentary: Lecithin is always bonded to choline, but cephalin may be ethanolamine or serine.)

Glycerophospholipids contain both polar and nonpolar regions that allow them to interact with polar and nonpolar substances.  They have a polar head containing the ionized amino alcohol and phosphate portion, which is strongly attrated to water.  They have a nonpolar hydrocarbon tail soluble only in nonpolar substances such as lipids.

(A slide is dedicated to what the teacher identifies as the way that glycerophospholipids actually show up in nature.  The polar head is turned the other way from the glycerol, and thus the polar head is followed by two nonpolar tails.)  (An image on the slide depicts a green rectangle with two yellow tails, simplifying the head-and-tail structure.)  (Teacher's commentary: Having a difference in polarity between the two parts, the head and tails of a glycerophospholipid molecule repel each other and thus turn in opposite directions.)

(Note of an unrecorded slide - also, my caps-lock key was shifted even though I didn't touch that section of the keyboard.  Someone is messing with my controls.  Again.). (Commentary: This line preserved even though I'm filling in the slide.  PLEASE stop messing with my keyboard.)

Sphingomyelin contains sphingosine, a long-chain amino alcohol that replaces glycerol, an amide bond formed by the amine group on the sphingosine to a fatty acid, and a hydroxyl group that forms an ester bond with phosphate, which forms another phosphoester bond to choline or ethanolamine.

(A slide is dedicated to the condensed structural diagram of a sphingomyelin containing myristic acid and choline.)

Sphingomyelins are abundant in the white matter of the myelin sheath, a coating surrounding the nerve cells that increases the speed of nerve impulses and insulates and protects the nerve cells.

In multiple sclerosis, sphingomyelin is lost from the myelin sheath, which protects the neurons in the brain and spinal cord.  The myelin sheath deteriorates as the disease progresses.  Scars form on the neurons and impair the transmission of nerve signals.
