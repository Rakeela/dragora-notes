6:33.  I'm awake.  It seems to have taken 11 minutes for me to get downstairs despite still wearing my pajama bottoms, but I'm awake.

7:31.  For no self-apparent reason, I walked over to the door and opened it.  A bug immediately flew outside.  I closed the door behind it.  I feel like I just got psychically manipulated by a bug that wanted to go outside.

7:44.  I got up early enough to see fog lit by the morning light, but it's already gone.

7:49.  80,282.  997 words on the chapter.  

9:29.  81,343.  2,053 words on the chapter.

9:54.  81,585.  2,300 words on the chapter.

10:26.  81,993.  2,708 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?

10:38.  82,305.  3,020 words on the chapter.

10:43.  82,298.  3,013 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?

10:46.  82,285.  2,998 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.  2,003 words of progress.  Quota complete.  I'm probably not done for the day, but I'm going to take a break.  I need to think about whether I want an upcoming battle to start with Kaire's perspective or Kura's.  I'm leaning on Kura's, which makes me wonder if I should just get it started already.

11:16.  I bought more red velvet chocolate chunk cookies!  More smores cookies, too.  They were steeply discounted, in the "these are going stale so we have to sell them" section.  They're still good!

11:35.  Fluids are not very satisfying when I'm hungry.  I'm plenty well hydrated, but my oral fixation continues.

11:48.  82,492.  209 words on the chapter.  Ugh.  How does the battle start?  I don't like battle planning.

11:56.  82,557.  274 words on the chapter.  How does the battle staaaart?

13:03.  83,614.  1,331 words on the chapter.  I've been requested to perform an errand, so I'm pausing a moment to get that done.

13:54.  I'm boycotting the local grocery store.  Their manager doesn't want me to ride my scooter in there.  The safety argument is bogus.  I've never fallen off my scooter on level terrain, and I've never run into anything at all.  It's safer for me to ride the scooter than to carry it in (since the weight will swing if I carry it).  I'm sweeping out some of the stuff I've gotten from them from my #Candy-Vault, since it's for stuff that I'm potentially buying.  I'm happy to shift my grocery purchasing to Amazon (who will certainly never restrict where I can ride a scooter) and Whole Foods (which isn't on the two item list of stores that have banned the scooter).

14:04.  Feeding my diet soda habit without a car and without the local grocery store is going to be considerably harder.  I'm probably going to have to stop drinking bottled soda.  It costs over twice as much from Amazon.  Hauling it in from the other side of town would be a substantial commitment.

15:53.  83,695.  1,412 words on the chapter.  I'm having trouble continuing.

16:45.  84,024.  1,741 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?  Nope.  Too far under the minimum.

17:45.  84,202.  1,919 words on the chapter.  I'm resorting to an info dump to try to meet my word count target.  This is terrible.

17:49.  Intolerable.  I'd rather bust my lower boundary of word count than continue this.

18:27.  84,229.  1,946 words on the chapter.  I improved the writing.  It's now mostly in dialogue rather than exposition.  I'm still chewing on the last bit.

18:44.  84,370.  2,052 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?  No, it's still too short.

19:07.  I got nothin'.  4,088 words of progress.  The 'war' arc was a disappointment.  Thousands of words of setup, 806 words of battle.
