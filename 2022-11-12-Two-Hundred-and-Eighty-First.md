Starting with 3,821 on the file... and the first thing that happens is that I notice an error.  I'm at -1 words progress, 1,668 to go.

4,140 words on the file.  319 words of progress, 1,348 words to go.

4,292 words on the file.  471 words of progress, 1,196 to go.  Kistaro bugged me, so I decided to retally.  Work really isn't flowing today.  I hope today isn't the day I blow my quota... or pretend I met it when I didn't really.

4,644 words on the file.  823 words of progress, 844 words to go.  Just about halfway done.

4,796 words.  975 words of progress, 692 words to go.  This material is terrible.

4,839 words.  1,018 words of progress, 649 words to go.  Finished the file, so I had to stop and retally.  Next file has to go to 649 to finish my quota.

906 words on the next file.  1,924 words of progress, 257 over quota.  Done!
