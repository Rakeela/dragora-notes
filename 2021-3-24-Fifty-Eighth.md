#2021-3-24-Fifty-Eighth

I dreamed about being an anthro shark last night.  That was something different.  I was a VIP in an economic planning office for a civilization with a keen interest in economic planning.  We could breathe above water or below.  The whole office was submerged, though the aeration was poor; a two foot air gap under the ten foot ceilings provided somewhere to swim up to for a breath however often the deoxygenated water made it necessary.

I was trying to get the appropriations approved for the construction of a new cruise ship to serve the interspecies tourism market.  We liked tourists.  Ships could provide mobile surface accommodations that would dock over our (off-)coastal cities.  Yet my colleagues and subordinates in the economic planning office wanted to prioritize improving oxygenation levels in the city water, and talking to people in oxygen-poor office water, there was only so hard I could push back against that.

Thinking about leisure subsidies in [[The-Viceroy]], I keep thinking that one of the things which leisure subsidies might be doing for galactic society is helping to filter out people who really don't want to work.  Going with my concept that the game's galactic society is constantly collapsing and rebuilding in different places, and is searching for stable immortals throughout this process, leisure subsidies could be serving a morally ambiguous purpose of luring miserable people out of society.

This is more broadly something that I think the Commonwealth's purchased happiness policies accomplish.  If someone's use of leisure subsidies is light and consistent, and they still also get work done...  Fine, they can be a stable immortal.  If someone hits the leisure subsidies hard and is totally taken out of society by them, removing them fits with the Commonwealth's basic reliance on rape culture.  They don't need anyone who isn't providing them with children and labor, and trying to develop talent in an honest way is too much work.

I think there's a basic brutality to the Commonwealth.  They're killing miserable people in large numbers, saying "we care about you," but then manipulating people to death.

The "Prenatal Education" thing is part of this thought, too.  What is "prenatal education" in the absence of mental transcription?  It's an evolved state where people don't need much education to prosper.  Such as might attain in a society that has been horrifically manipulating people to quell genes which aren't useful for providing them with children and labor.  Generations of abusive filtration to find only people who naturally fit in would produce that.

Basically, the triumph of the Commonwealth Consensus looks like the triumph of scientific pedophilia.  The Commonwealth Consensus idealize rapid maturation, and then want to have more kids who'll mature very rapidly.  Well, we *know* how that can be achieved IRL.  It involves a lot of child molestation.  Molested children mature rapidly and are fecund.  They aren't usually scientifically competent IRL, but this game postulates an advanced galactic technology base.

If you combined ubiquitous child molestation with an extremely manipulative society constantly filtering people out as "dead" because they were too interested in leisure, and then also breeding the people whose minds still work when they're part of a generational pattern of victimization, you might indeed get a lot of science out of that.  You'd also get a lot of serial killers, but hey who cares?  Tons of cheap children and labor can keep people too occupied to worry about serial killers.

Having a large base of loyal serial killers to rely upon could help with further filtration on the leisure subsidy program as well, since once people are "dead" in leisure, why bother keeping them alive?  Nobody "comes back to life" who was given a perfect hedonic environment.

It reminds me of how I was treated.  I was regarded as a potentially intelligent person who wanted nothing but sex - a lusting hypernatalist with a mind.  So I was molested for years, and when I was deemed unsuitable for reproduction as a result of massive depression brought on by helplessness in the face of molestation, I was marked for elimination from society as a useless person.  By people who had systematically destroyed my potential with manipulations...

I was treated as having been killed by perfect leisure - as having been God granted a perfect fun time forever, having all my sexual desires slaked, even the most depraved!  When it's like... why.  Why was it so incomprehensible that I wouldn't like stuff that almost nobody likes?  Why did these perfectly virtuous people forget all the conversations we had about the ethics of fiction?  Why did I get raped?

Why would humans value a social system constructed of ubiquitous child molestation?

Conservatives throughout history have stalked the victims of child molestation, too.  That's the link between nationalist indoctrination, enlightened policing, and the surveillance planets.  Their society is all criminals... because their society is based on child molestation, has the violent erraticity of all societies with ubiquitous child molestation, and falls apart in non-reproduction if you seriously crack down on the molestation of children.

There's no need for an advanced society to be 'all criminals'.  IRL, almost everyone is lawful.  Humanity is not going to develop as these societies in The Viceroy develop.  The Glasswall Grid would work better than the "you're all criminals and will be happy or else" of the Commonwealth Consensus, but there are no Glasswall Grids in The Viceroy's technology tree.

There's a basic rape dependency of IRL governments who aren't willing to oppose pedophilia sincerely enough to be sexually liberal.  I wish conservatives cared about the welfare of children as something other than a posture they affect in order to improve their reproductive success.

I don't think the Basic Income technology is or could be part of what I imagine to be the basic evil of the Commonwealth Consensus, although in a pro-leisure sense it is fairly adjacent to it.  I think that basic income programs result in everyone in society having a stake in the productivity of everyone in society, so that technological advances no longer destroy quality of life.

The cultures that put the Commonwealth in their lower class have the approximate right of it; that pattern fades out early if society has advanced tools to deal with it.  The unity of the Commonwealth gives way to the unity of Empire, which yields in turn to the diversity of the Panarchy, this being at last the structure willing to acknowledge the rights of all.  If the high-Wealth societies could also refrain from reproducing so as to maintain the luxuries of space and sustainability, the game might truly depict paradise.

I do not mean to demonize sex with the completion of this sentence and the sentence that follows, but sex as an end in itself is a vapid and unfulfilling drive.  Nobody can be heavily invested in sex itself without failing to notice its emptiness.  Sex in the fuller hedonic form that sex-positivity relies upon is a celebration of relationships.  Strong romantic relationships help people to become better people; mandatory sexuality rather famously tends to make them worse.

Someday with rejuvenation technologies, relationships will become everlasting... but resources will still be *finite*.  I believe that people will understand that they can enjoy their good relationships for milennia only in a society that refrains from natalism and abusive sexuality.  I think that'll be a sex-positive paradise, too; ubiquitous sterilization will then permit sex to serve its proper loving role exclusively!

Pervasive digitization resolves violent culture.  It creates barriers between people, confining violent inclinations.  It favors peaceful people, who form connections more readily in an environment that covers them in a thick distance armor.  It provides for non-violent dueling tools, or else for 'violent' dueling tools which cannot affect population growth rates.  Finally, it provides for the creation of upload environments, where violence is *truly* useless in determining the evolution of culture, and only the artwar remains.

On the other hand, if you have pervasive digitization, I'm not sure resolving violent culture is necessarily important, since your upload population is just not going to be affected the way a physical population would be.  Using pervasive digitization to its full anti-violence potential feels a little like punishing non-reproduction and the desire for personal space.  A sufficiently digitized society could simulate violent culture exquisitely well while achieving a strong expectation that *even locally*, peaceful people are only being affected by externalities to the extent that they may find trouble finding people to engage in their preferred recreations.

To the extent that those preferred recreations are sexual, the 'pacifist' here shouldn't *be* favored.  As a pacifist anti-natalist, my opinion about violent culture is that it would be okay if I could be sure that the participants would never hit *me*.  People who want to do something other than sex for eternity are proposing to do something that doesn't destroy the basic sustainability of future societies.  I approve of that.

I mean, for a real world example of how simulated violence can turn aside real violence, look at MOBA games generally, and especially at DOTA 2.  That game seems to wildly stress out its participants, and it seems to be very thrilling to a specific kind of person.  If they want to be stressed out like that in this big nasty zero-sum conflict...  I don't get it, but I can't hate them for it.  Their love of that game does me no harm.  Go go gadget gaming league, hahaha.  E-sports are valid too.

It's a good idea to resist giving the orbital surveyors their capstone technology.  The upkeep cost reduction can only pay off when you have spectacular administrators (+100% bureaucratic cost reduction) or when you have totally lost control of the administrative work (>95% bureaucratic costs).  Otherwise, the bureaucratic expense eats the upkeep savings.  There's probably some way to exactly calculate the threshold at which the upkeep savings exceed the bureaucratic costs, but I haven't given it that much thought yet.

Armor seems to work better than shielding for the smaller ships.  Shields don't seem to matter until you have so much shielding and regen that you can tolerate incoming damage indefinitely, which is an easier threshold to attain for the larger ships.  Shields would also be more effective against Imperial ships that use slower-firing weapons... but if you have a small ship, you can get an awful lot of armor per each point of generators, so on cruisers armor is still better.

On this note...  What is a non-linear railgun?  Railguns have to be linear, don't they?

In other news, I'm out of (online) college for the semester.  Yesterday, I was thinking that today I could dive into my copy of Dendritic Cell Protocols, 2nd Edition, and fill out this day log with thoughts on it to try to keep myself engaged with studying it.  These day-logs seem to meet my unexpected personal need for publishing my thoughts in an ongoing way.  It's not quite as exciting as linking to something available online, but it might still work for me.

I'm not sure how to attribute dates to the chapters in this book, so they're all going to be listed as June, 2009, to which the book's foreword is attributed; my apologies if that's incorrect.

Weird personal trivia:  If I do not otherwise have present symptoms of illness and I have not recently sneezed enough for sneezing itself to be a source of suffering, then I feel a little bit luckier every time I sneeze.  Sneezing when I'm not sick feels like the touch of a benevolent god.  Not that I believe in any such thing, mind you.

Kalinski, P.  Wieckowski, E.  Muthuswamy, R.  de Jong, E.  (2009, Jul.)  Generation of stable Th1/CTL-, Th2-, and Th17-inducing Human Dendritic Cells.  *Dendritic Cell Protocols*.  Retrieved 2021-3-24 from a physical book.

Just looking at the title, this may be less than ideal for my interests.  Th17-inducing dendritic cells are a pro-inflammatory lineage which is up-regulated over the course of lifespan, and I consider it a likely candidate for causing immunosenescence.  Still, I'm hoping this will be instructive as to the methods of how to culture dendritic cells.

This talks about the plasticity of dendritic cells, which is something that I've seen mention of before in other texts when IL-17 emitting dendritic cells were being discussed.  I find myself wondering if the dendritic cell is an unusually stable basis for modification due to some kind of survivability trait.  A cell which has many entropic configurations is bad news for aging, but it might be good news for transgenic optimization, which in turn is something we need in order to create cures for aging.  I'm speculating way off from anything I know about, so this last bit amounts to wool-gathering, but I wonder if other kinds of specialist cell may be someday created using dendritic cells as a basis.

I want to create anergizing-specialist dendritic cells.  It's a bit of a wince to realize that this is talking about stable generation of Th17-inducing human dendritic cells, given that I consider IL-17 emission to be potentially an error state.  One of the challenges with studying human aging is that not everything which is 'faulty' is necessarily going to be something that we can immediately identify as faulty, especially when transitting from the macroscale to the microscale, and especially when studying zones of relatively novel understanding such as dendritic cells.  I've been repeatedly surprised by how recent this subject is.  I couldn't have gotten into this in childhood, because it didn't exist to be gotten into.

The protocol itself is a bit intrinsically dense.  I'd have to look up each piece of it.  I wonder how it would differ from a protocol that would filter exclusively for Th-17 inducing dendritic cells.  Will I be able to tell?  An earlier chapter (5) talks about in vitro (laboratory) generation of dendritic cells; a later chapter (8) talks about generating tolerogenic dendritic cells.  The information might be here.

It's petty, but I'm a little concerned about my fine manual dexterity for some of this work.  I'm clumsy, not graceful.  I have the hands of a pianist, the shoulders of a farmer, and the brain of something else.  Lab work may leave me wishing I had prosthetic hands so that I could have a system which would behave in more well-defined ways than my natural hands.  If my hands offend me, can I cut them off?
