I dreamed about being an anthro shark last night.  That was something different.  I was a VIP in an economic planning office for a civilization with a keen interest in economic planning.  We could breathe above water or below.  The whole office was submerged, though the aeration was poor; a two foot air gap under the ten foot ceilings provided somewhere to swim up to for a breath however often the deoxygenated water made it necessary.

I was trying to get the appropriations approved for the construction of a new cruise ship to serve the interspecies tourism market.  We liked tourists.  Ships could provide mobile surface accommodations that would dock over our (off-)coastal cities.  Yet my colleagues and subordinates in the economic planning office wanted to prioritize improving oxygenation levels in the city water, and talking to people in ogygen-poor office water, there was only so hard I could push back against that.
