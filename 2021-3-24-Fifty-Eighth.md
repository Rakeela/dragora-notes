I dreamed about being an anthro shark last night.  That was something different.  I was a VIP in an economic planning office for a civilization with a keen interest in economic planning.  We could breathe above water or below.  The whole office was submerged, though the aeration was poor; a two foot air gap under the ten foot ceilings provided somewhere to swim up to for a breath however often the deoxygenated water made it necessary.

I was trying to get the appropriations approved for the construction of a new cruise ship to serve the interspecies tourism market.  We liked tourists.  Ships could provide mobile surface accommodations that would dock over our (off-)coastal cities.  Yet my colleagues and subordinates in the economic planning office wanted to prioritize improving oxygenation levels in the city water, and talking to people in oxygen-poor office water, there was only so hard I could push back against that.

Thinking about leisure subsidies in [[The-Viceroy]], I keep thinking that one of the things which leisure subsidies might be doing for galactic society is helping to filter out people who really don't want to work.  Going with my concept that the game's galactic society is constantly collapsing and rebuilding in different places, and is searching for stable immortals throughout this process, leisure subsidies could be serving a morally ambiguous purpose of luring miserable people out of society.

This is more broadly something that I think the Commonwealth's purchased happiness policies accomplish.  If someone's use of leisure subsidies is light and consistent, and they still also get work done...  Fine, they can be a stable immortal.  If someone hits the leisure subsidies hard and is totally taken out of society by them, that fits the Commonwealth's basic reliance on rape culture.  They don't need anyone who isn't providing them with children and labor, and trying to develop talent in an honest way is too much work.

I think there's a basic brutality to the Commonwealth.  They're killing miserable people in large numbers, saying "we care about you," but then manipulating people to death.

The "Prenatal Education" thing is part of this thought, too.  What is "prenatal education" in the absence of mental transcription?  It's an evolved state where people don't need much education to prosper.  Such as might attain in a society that has been horrifically manipulating people to quell genes which aren't useful for providing them with children and labor.  Generations of abusive filtration to find only people who naturally fit in would produce that.

Basically, the triumph of the Commonwealth Consensus looks like the triumph of scientific pedophilia.  The Commonwealth Consensus idealize rapid maturation, and then want to have more kids who'll mature very rapidly.  Well, we *know* how that can be achieved IRL.  It involves a lot of child molestation.  Molested children mature rapidly and are fecund.  They aren't usually scientifically competent IRL, but this game postulates an advanced galactic technology base.

If you combined ubiquitous child molestation with an extremely manipulative society constantly filtering people out as "dead" because they were too interested in leisure, and then also breeding the people whose minds still work when they're part of a generational pattern of victimization, you might indeed get a lot of science out of that.  You'd also get a lot of serial killers, but hey who cares?  Tons of cheap children and labor can keep people too occupied to worry about serial killers.

Having a large base of loyal serial killers to rely upon could help with further filtration on the leisure subsidy program as well, since once people are "dead" in leisure, why bother keeping them alive?  Nobody "comes back to life" who was given a perfect hedonic environment.

It reminds me of how I was treated.  I was regarded as a potentially intelligent person who wanted nothing but sex - a lusting hypernatalist with a mind.  So I was molested for years, and when I was deemed unsuitable for reproduction as a result of massive depression brought on by helplessness in the face of molestation, I was marked for elimination from society as a useless person.  By people who had systematically destroyed my potential with manipulations...

I was treated as having been killed by perfect leisure - as having been God granted a perfect fun time forever, having all my sexual desires slaked, even the most depraved!  When it's like... why.  Why was it so incomprehensible that I wouldn't like stuff that almost nobody likes?  Why did these perfectly virtuous people forget all the conversations we had about the ethics of fiction?  Why did I get raped?

I don't think the Basic Income technology is or could be part of what I imagine to be the basic evil of the Commonwealth Consensus, although in a pro-leisure sense it is fairly adjacent to it.  I think that basic income programs result in everyone in society having a stake in the productivity of everyone in society, so that technological advances no longer destroy quality of life.

In other news, I'm out of (online) college for the semester.  Yesterday, I was thinking that today I could dive into my copy of Dendritic Cell Protocols, 2nd Edition, and fill out this day log with thoughts on it to try to keep myself engaged with studying it.  These day-logs seem to meet my unexpected personal need for publishing my thoughts in an ongoing way.  It's not quite as exciting as linking to something available online, but it might still work for me.

I'm not sure how to attribute dates to the chapters in this book, so they're all going to be listed as June, 2009, to which the book's foreword is attributed; my apologies if that's incorrect.

Kalinski, P.  Wieckowski, E.  Muthuswamy, R.  de Jong, E.  (2009, Jul.)  Generation of stable Th1/CTL-, Th2-, and Th17-inducing Human Dendritic Cells.  *Dendritic Cell Protocols*.  Retrieved 2021-3-24 from a physical book.

Just looking at the title, this may be less than ideal for my interests.  Th17-inducing dendritic cells are a pro-inflammatory lineage which is up-regulated over the course of lifespan, and I consider it a likely candidate for causing immunosenescence.  Still, I'm hoping this will be instructive as to the methods of how to culture dendritic cells.

This talks about the plasticity of
