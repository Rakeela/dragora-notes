# Exploited Hyperpalatability

Exploited hyperpalatability utilizes short-sighted engagement with peoples' preferences to extract economic resources from them and/or injure their long-term potential.  The most primitive example of exploited hyperpalatability is probably a simple poisoner's lore: "poison the food that people actually like so they'll make excuses to eat what you've poisoned, for if you poison the food that they're barely willing to eat they'll be hunting for reasons not to touch it."  Most modern hyperpalatability exploitation occurs in retail, though it is also endemic to food economics more broadly.

Extreme hyperpalatability exploitation is sometimes classified as an existential threat specifically known as '[[wireheading]]', which some people would classify as a subcomponent of [[plague]] (due to mind-virus psuedo-epidemiology), but which I personally consider to be properly classified as a subcomponent of [[war]] (since it is an existential threat derived from conscious actors directing the destruction of other conscious actors).

Exploited hyperpalatability must be contrasted with [[hedonology]], which uses the same information towards less evil ends.  Since hedonology uses the same information towards more positive stabilizing ends, it's important to beware the [[moral-hazard-of-existential-threat]] when agitating against exploited hyperpalatability.  Hyperpalatability research is not evil of itself, even though it has potentially evil applications.
