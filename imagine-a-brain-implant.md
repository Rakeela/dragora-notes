# Imagine a Brain Implant

This will be a list of all imagine-a-brain-implement moments throughout my notes.  I'll record them here and link back to the node where they were first described.

Imagine a brain implant that:
1.  Scavenges fatigue chemicals during the day (to improve peak productivity) and releases them in the evening (to increase the regularity of rest states). ([[night-and-day]])
2.  Maintains a reservoir of exogenous mitochondria and dumps them in the event of a stroke. ([[exogenous-mitochondria]])
3.  Taste-sense interceptor that does additional processing and reports its findings, permitting the bearer of the implant to experience additional layers of precision and detail in their sense of taste.  Beyond gourmand applications, this would also increase resistance to biochemical hazards (poisons and pathogens) through earlier, more accurate detection of conditions indicative of them or amenable to their proliferation.  Voluntary consciousness networking may also utilize this data for shared hedonics, performance-optimizing nutrition, or general health policy, whereas involuntary consciousness networking may use it for exploitation, torture, or assassination through manipulation of observed hyperpalatability (poison the foods that people like most).  ([[Hedonology]])
