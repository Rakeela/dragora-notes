# Imagine a Brain Implant

This will be a list of all imagine-a-brain-implement moments throughout my notes.  I'll record them here and link back to the node where they were first described.

Imagine a brain implant that:
1.  Scavenges fatigue chemicals during the day (to improve peak productivity) and releases them in the evening (to increase the regularity of rest states). ([[night-and-day]])
2.  Maintains a reservoir of exogenous mitochondria and dumps them in the event of a stroke. ([[exogenous-mitochondria]])
