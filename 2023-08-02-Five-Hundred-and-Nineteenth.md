8:35.  I woke up at 5:30 and got out of bed at 5:33, but I only just finished 'morning stuff' (Nationstates and Flight Rising).

8:37.  There was a nap for a while after I woke up involved in there, too.  I don't know exactly when it could be said that I got up.  Oh, but I also read two(?) chapters of a good book.

11:58.  I've been playing the game Bombe for hours.  I do not feel competent with it.  There's variables!  I can't do variable logic in the game.

12:50.  I played a climate game.  The name annoys me, so I haven't decided to name it yet.  207 words on the file.

13:15.  Credit 45 words editing.

14:03.  856 words on the file.  Slow going.  649 words of progress.

16:45.  Credit 497 words of editing.  To Kura and Kaire.  Both of today's editing credits have been to K&K while the writing has been to Greeve's Ambition.  I haven't been working consistently since my last time point.  I've been laying around bemoaning my diet.

18:16.  More Cultist Simulator.  It's good for inspiration, but I get sucked into it.  The basic fantasy of painting influences into the world, mm!  That's why it's good inspiration.  I long to do that.  I want my writing to do that.

18:23.  Credit 102 words editing.

18:24.  Credit 12 words editing.

18:28.  Credit 62 words editing.

18:29.  Credit 72 words editing.

18:30.  I think that's it for that editing pass.  That's 790 words edited.

18:40.  Credit 205 words editing.

20:14.  995 words edited.  1,553 words on the file.  1,346 words of progress.

20:37.  1,965 words on the file.  1,758 words of progress.

20:40.  Argh.  I've only worked for like five and a half hours today.
