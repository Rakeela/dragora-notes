I've discovered something that I ought to record.  Previous experimentation suggested that my metabolism burns some amount of calories less than fourteen hundred calories per day.  The 'experiment' in question was calorie counting; the finding was that on fourteen hundred calories per day my weight still increased, therefore establishing that my metabolism was using less than that per day.  Yet analyzing my weight loss rate from recent fasting periods has suggested that my metabolism is burning well over three thousand calories per day... while I'm in ketosis.

It's like my glucose metabolism is crippled such that most of what I eat gets stored as fat instead of being used for metabolism, but my ketone metabolism is normal.  Since glucose metabolism shuts down ketone metabolism, my body packs on pounds when I eat while in glucose mode, yet I stay exhausted and hungry.  Maybe this is why I find intermittent fasting so much easier as a method of weight control than calorie counting.  I have more energy like this.

I have no idea what's wrong with my metabolism.  Can fat storage intercept resources BEFORE the metabolism has had the opportunity to use them?  Diabetes would prevent effective use of glucose, but I've been tested for diabetes on many occasions and I've been informed of negative test results.

Whatever the issue is, I've been finding once again that regular fasting is an effective treatment.  I've tracked my weight daily for the past month, and in that time I've dropped a shirt size.  I kept one old shirt I no longer fit into from prior weight gain, waiting for the day I would fit into it again, and now it's properly comfortable while the rest of my wardrobe hangs loose.

Eventually, I'll have a healthy weight, although I think my frame is literally broad enough that I may stop trying to lose weight while technically overweight.  If I run out of gut, I think that'll be it for my motivation to lose weight.  I think I might end up a bit of a pear, because my butt and thighs are pretty massive, whereas so far my gut is shrinking faster.  I'm not unhappy about that.  I like thick thighs.

Since I have no clue what's wrong with my metabolism, I have to expect that someday I'll have 'a healthy weight' (or as near as seems appropriate for my frame) while still having weird half-crippled glucose metabolism.  I'll have to do some calculations then to determine what a 'maintenance fasting' schedule looks like.  Ironically, I may be unhappy about it, if the days when I eat end up days when my metabolism underperforms and leaves me exhausted.

P.S. I love Lenny and Larry's Cookies!  They're the most satisfying cookies.  Nobody's paying me to say any of this; I don't have the circulation to charge.  My favorite variety is their choc-o-mint and I tend to start craving L&L choc-o-mint cookies while I'm fasting.  I like their keto chocolate chip cookies as well, though their keto peanut butter and keto coconut cookies are very mediocre.  Actually, I find that whole brand is bad at peanut butter cookies, haha.  Even the non-keto peanut butter cookies aren't very good if they're from L&L, but most of the rest of their cookies are great!
