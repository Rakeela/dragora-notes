7:17.  I did no writing yesterday, but I did stress about my writing, thinking about whether to continue on with Kura and Kaire.  Anyways, I also did use my treadmill, so: 5.8 miles. 1,054 kcal.   21,267 steps.  4 hours, 52 minutes, 1 second.  Average speed 1.1 mph.  Again, this is for *yesterday*.

9:34.  Morning stuff done, plus I've checked the local grocery stores for discounts on my favorite cookies (no luck).  Now I'm on my treadmill thinking about Liberal Crime Squad.  The only thing that LCS makes me want to do is play more LCS.  I've won two games of it recently and there's not a lot of depth to it.  Sneak into places, steal everything not nailed down, fund training of thief-taggers who'll take more risks and cause more visible mayhem.  Rinse, repeat.

9:37.  My weight has been ticking upwards the last few days.  I've been eating more in the mornings and exercising less during the days.  But also, I haven't had a bowel movement in days.

10:08.  38,433.

10:48.  38,615.

14:20.  I've been playing LCS.  I've save-scummed a few times to avoid bad chase sequences... and I've tolerated a few bad results.  The scum rate drops with increasing familiarity with the game.

15:16.  38,983.  Progress is slow.  I'm not rich with ideas today.

21:43.  550 words of progress in writing.  In treadmill, 5.7 miles.  1,007 kcal.  20,564 steps.  4 hours, 28 minutes, 59 seconds.  Average speed... it crashed, but it should be 1.2 mph.
