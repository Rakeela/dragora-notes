#2022-11-02-Two-Hundred-and-Seventy-First

To make sure I get my word counts correct, I'm updating my notes with today's wordcount.  I'm starting the day with 7168 words in my story, of which I counted 2,568 words written yesterday.  Except the software that I'm writing with counted 2,579 words written.  Little errors upset me...  I don't know where that crept in.  Anyways.  I'll use that total.  My first day's nanowrimo output was 2,579 words.

...tch.  I couldn't resist editing a prior scene just a little bit.  That's going to mess with my ability to record my wordcount accurately today.  There's going to be another anomaly tomorrow.  Oh well, no big deal.  I get a few 'free' words today and I'll get a few 'free' words tomorrow.  The quota is really a pain.
