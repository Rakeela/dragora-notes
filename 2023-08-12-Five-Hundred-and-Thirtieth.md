11:01.  25,527.  25,624.  I forgot to mark the time point just as I started, and remembered shortly after.

18:27.  26,152.  625 words of progress.  Wah.  Today has been hard.  I've been so tired.

18:28.  Tiredness isn't the whole story.  I also got distracted watching a three-movie marathon.

18:29.  This is the first time all day that I've thought this, so it definitely doesn't account for today's poor productivity, but I am not a big fan of litRPG.  I have a hard time conceiving of Kura and Kaire as anything but a litRPG.  If I could easily conceive of it as a story without that feature...  I would rewrite it without that feature.

19:12.  I don't usually buy M&Ms, but I made an exception.  There are now coffee M&Ms.

20:55.  26,691.  1,164 words of progress.  Argh.  I'm having trouble meeting quota today.  I watched four movies - or more like three and a half - so that's part of the problem.  The other part is the time I spent on the couch, being exhausted.  But I've also walked for eight hours today, so I've had time at my computer.

21:28.  26,873.  1,346 words of progress.  So close to quota.

21:50.  27,051.  1,524 words of progress.  I think that's it for tonight.  10.2 miles.  1,922 kcal.  39,232 steps.  8 hours, 52 minutes, 27 seconds.  Hm, the treadmill glitched.  I didn't get to see what my average speed was, and I had to reset it to turn it off.
