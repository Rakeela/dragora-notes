Would it be possible to create a ZPE harvester with fractal nano-ratchets?  A sufficiently small ratchet should turn by chaos, and still turn only one way; if a series of these fed into larger ratchets, wouldn't they also cause the larger ratchets to turn by chaos?  If you keep stepping it up, you'd eventually be able to hook it to something that permits conventional energy generation, such as by lifting drops of water from a lower reservoir to a higher reservoir, and periodically dropping the higher reservoir into a macro-scale generator.  Voila!  Macro-scale effect from ZPE.  That's "fractal nano-ratchets".

It's free energy!  Kind of.  The cost: it works super-slowly, and is extremely difficult to engineer.

It's a concept totally outside of my skills, but I don't know what if anything is wrong with the logic of it.

I feel depressed and headachy today.  I have math homework.  I am approximately 2% enthusiastic for this.  I'm very dissatisfied with my math course.  For the first time in my life, a math course is being *too easy*.

When I'm not sick and collapsing every time I try to study, math isn't cripplingly difficult like it was when I was younger.  My medical issues were more wholly untreated then.  I still live in pain today, but my complaints aren't disdained, and I've found work-arounds for some of my issues.  I have better medical care now than I had as a child, and it's making me more productive.  If I could ship some of what I've learned back to my childhood, I would've been a totally different person due to being more productive in my classes.  I would've stayed a classic nerd... and I never would've investigated xenomitochondria, morphological freedom, or tolerogenic RNA injections.

Huh.  In hindsight, I have cause to be grateful that my health and happiness collapsed completely in that period.  That put me on the track of technologies that might contribute to the pursuit of immortality.

I woke up feeling depressed today, but I've been happier overall since I started curating this "dragora archive" as I call it.  I pronounce that dray-gore-ah.  I can work well enough that I've been studying potential future treatments for my health issues in a new, more rigorous way.  Just as I introduced myself in [[2020-11-23-third]], I'm medically autodidactic.  That was already true, but now it's true in a more regular, constructive way, with a better ability to push forward specific lines of study and assemble them into testable hypotheses.

I believe I'm smart enough to be a mathematician, though I don't believe it's the best application of my person.

Frost, J.  (2021.)  "Standardization."  *Statistics By Jim.*  Retrieved 2021-3-9 from https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/standardization/#:~:text=Typically%2C%20to%20standardize%20variables%2C%20you,divide%20by%20the%20standard%20deviation.

I've been trying to use yet having trouble remembering this fact today, I'm going to record it:

(Quoted from Source)
"To standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable.  Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation."

I'm still having morale problems right now.  I think that's why my ability to actuate the information I'm taking in by studying is being limited.

Lately, I've been having good luck with multitasking for hedonic support, and I'm therefore going to load up The Viceroy on one monitor, while having my assignment on the other.

I confirmed last night that I couldn't multitask mathematics and exercise effectively (at least with my current skill level at both tasks), but I've confirmed to myself several times that I can multitask strategy games and exercise.  I'm going to see if I can multitask a strategy game with math homework.  I think that achieving a math synergy requires serenity which strategy games are good at supporting, so I'm hopeful of success.

There may be something to the concept of a panarchic work ethic, but I'm still not sure.  I think my productivity is still poor overall.  The thing that makes me valuable as a person is the angle of my productivity, not the velocity of it.

I think I'll need three monitors to effectively multitask The Viceroy with math homework.  The Viceroy needs one monitor; mathematics is easier with two.  If I had three monitors at my workstation, I would have enough screens to make no compromises at my present skill level.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to mount three monitors in a workspace.

"To standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable.  Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation."

I'm putting a sample equation for this on a labeled index card that I use as a book mark.

Other notes...  Z-score counts standard deviations.  If something has a Z-score of 2.2, it is 2.2 standard deviations higher than the observed mean.  If something has a Z-score of -0.4, it is -0.4 standard deviations lower than the observed mean.

I refer to my specific class notes files less than I refer to my daylogs, so far.  I'm unsure what that should imply for the way I organize information in this archive.

My name was eaten; it is not to be seen.  Did we forget that could happen in the real?

This game's soundtrack is not ideally helpful for this multitasking.

I think I was even smarter than I am today, at one point in my youth.  My early life was hideously stressful, so I'm not surprised that I lost something to that, but...  I wonder what happened, neurologically.  I wonder what specific processes were involved, and if that bit of entropy can be pushed back.  I would really like to be able to visualize more complex shapes again.  Like, the *really* complex ones.

Would formal study of topography help?  I think playing Hyper-Rogue may have already helped (somewhat, though I have not yet found the holy grail), but I've gotten the impression that people generally *learn* to do that kind of thing.
