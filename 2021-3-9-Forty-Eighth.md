#2021-3-9-Forty-Eighth

Would it be possible to create a ZPE harvester with fractal nano-ratchets?  A sufficiently small ratchet should turn by chaos, and still turn only one way; if a series of these fed into larger ratchets, wouldn't they also cause the larger ratchets to turn by chaos?  If you keep stepping it up, you'd eventually be able to hook it to something that permits conventional energy generation, such as by lifting drops of water to a reservoir, and periodically dropping it into a macro-scale generator.  Voila!  Macro-scale effect from ZPE.  That's "fractal nano-ratchets".

It's free energy!  Kind of.  The cost: it works super-slowly, and is extremely difficult to engineer.

It's a concept totally outside of my skills, but I don't know what if anything is wrong with the logic of it.
