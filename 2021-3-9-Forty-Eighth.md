Would it be possible to create a ZPE harvester with fractal nano-ratchets?  A sufficiently small ratchet should turn by chaos, and still turn only one way; if a series of these fed into larger ratchets, wouldn't they also cause the larger ratchets to turn by chaos?  If you keep stepping it up, you'd eventually be able to hook it to something that permits conventional energy generation, such as by lifting drops of water from a lower reservoir to a higher reservoir, and periodically dropping the higher reservoir into a macro-scale generator.  Voila!  Macro-scale effect from ZPE.  That's "fractal nano-ratchets".

It's free energy!  Kind of.  The cost: it works super-slowly, and is extremely difficult to engineer.

It's a concept totally outside of my skills, but I don't know what if anything is wrong with the logic of it.

I feel depressed and headachy today.  I have math homework.  I am approximately 2% enthusiastic for this.  I'm very dissatisfied with my math course.  For the first time in my life, a math course is being *too easy*.

When I'm not sick and collapsing every time I try to study, math isn't cripplingly difficult like it was when I was younger.  My medical issues were more wholly untreated then.  I still live in pain today, but my complaints aren't disdained, and I've found work-arounds for some of my issues.  I have better medical care now than I had as a child, and it's making me more productive.  If I could ship some of what I've learned back to my childhood, I would've been a totally different person due to being more productive in my classes.  I would've stayed a classic nerd... and I never would've investigated xenomitochondria, morphological freedom, or tolerogenic RNA injections.

Huh.  In hindsight, I have cause to be grateful that my health and happiness collapsed completely in that period.  That put me on the track of technologies that might contribute to the pursuit of immortality.

I woke up feeling depressed today, but I've been happier overall since I started curating this "dragora archive" as I call it.  I pronounce that dray-gore-ah.  I can work well enough that I've been studying potential future treatments for my health issues in a new, more rigorous way.  Just as I introduced myself in [[2020-11-23-third]], I'm medically autodidactic.  That was already true, but now it's true in a more regular, constructive way, with a better ability to push forward specific lines of study and assemble them into testable hypotheses.

I believe I'm smart enough to be a mathematician, though I don't believe it's the best application of my person.

I've been trying to use yet having trouble remembering this fact today, I'm going to record it:

(Quoted from Source)
"To standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable.  Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation."
