Three hours ago, I was in a conversaion with someone when my focus drifted.  I am presently facing the awkwardness of deciding whether to try to pick it up immediately.  This is one of the downsides of virtual interactions.  They lack the immediacy of being face to face with someone.  I do not feel the presence of people online quite as keenly as I should need to in order to prosper in the manner I am accustomed to living.
