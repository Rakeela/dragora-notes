I've picked up a chemistry textbook from the library for additional study.  It looks more approachable than the assigned textbook.  This may or may not hit my bibliography.  I think if I finish even one section of it entirely, I'll add a "(Partial)" entry to the bibliography.

Restudying the slides is appalling to me for some reason.  Rather than fighting that feeling, perhaps I can productively utilize my inclination to read obsessively by seeing if I can conquer a "new" text.  At least one section of it covers (a subsection of) the same material as is in my course, so I'm hoping it will still be good for my grades.

Rereading material almost never feels productive.  Of all rereading tasks that I've encountered, it is almost true that only rereading the stories that I've written feels productive.  This is an unfortunate bias in my cognition, since rereading the slides from chemistry class would be quicker by a day of hours than reading the organic chemistry section of a new tome.

The only other productive rereading task so far is rereading my research notes.  My proposed general protocol for tolerogenic treatments is overly ambitious and interestingly weird.  Mutant dendritic cells that present prepared peptides and *do not* present a peptide binding groove, reducing their likelihood to pick up new peptides and (even more importantly) reducing their likelihood to inspire hostile immune responses!  If the mutant dendritic cells are possible to prepare, they might really work!

I have to get a lot of classes behind me in order to get access to research labs to see if I can produce hypoallergenic mutant dendritic cells.  I wonder if I can do that as an experiment at university.  Will I still think it's plausible once I've gone further in my classes?

My mind seems active this morning, but not accurate.  I'm distracted.  I recently acquired a different set of energy drinks from the ones that I'm accustomed to and they're having a terrible effect.  Hyperactivity and an excessive need to urinate.  Very distracting.  I can't presently leave class for a bio break.  I can depart for the restroom in half an hour perhaps when the teacher pauses between sections.

Caffeine in the morning helps me get moving in the morning so I can reach my morning class, but I need to acquire more of the particular energy drinks that I'm accustomed to instead of these.  They're rose-flavored!  Better taste, better effect.  I think my preferred brand is less caffeinated than the one I substituted in.

Orphaned punchline:  "I'm in morning."  Suggested use: Morning alertness stereotypes.  Risk factors: Misuse of mourning concept.  Misc:  My sense of humor works poorly.

This thought reminds me, while I was on the bus this morning I wondered if comedy relies on risk.  Are there people whose attention is held by the risk-taking involved in humor?  The ones who are very rude are very awful and easily bored, but perhaps the comedic risk-takers who are only very slightly rude are very good.

It is emotionally difficult to read about a scientist named Dumas ridiculing his former student in scientific journals.  Dumas?  Really?  Yes, of course dumbass ridicules his student.

His student was wrong btw.  His rivals were wrong, too.  Science suffers from a fascinating historical epidemic of wrongness.  It's from this book about chemistry that I'm reading to pass a moment of time in class when the slides are not proceeding and no study check is on the board.

Modern scientists seem more respectful than historical scientists.  They respect wrongness more even as they suffer from it less.  I wonder what changed.  In many sectors, society seems to have become more rude, but modern scientists seem to have become polite without being uptight.

I wonder if I should put the workspace file into an ignore list.  I want different computers that access this archive to have different workspaces.  Discarding the changes all the time is kind of annoying.

I'm not looking forward to the exam in [[Chem131]].  I've finally realized what's lurking behind all the generous rules in class activities (participation grades) and homework (three tries for right answers).  The lurking thing is that the exams (one try) are 55% of the grade.  So doing well at all the other stuff and then failing the exam means failing the class.

I think I'll do fine, but exam stress is inevitable.
