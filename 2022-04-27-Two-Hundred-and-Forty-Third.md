I've picked up a chemistry textbook from the library for additional study.  It looks more approachable than the assigned textbook.  This may or may not hit my bibliography.  I think if I finish even one section of it entirely, I'll add a "(Partial)" entry to the bibliography.

Restudying the slides is appalling to me for some reason.  Rather than fighting that feeling, perhaps I can productively utilize my inclination to read obsessively by seeing if I can conquer a "new" text.  At least one section of it covers (a subsection of) the same material as is in my course, so I'm hoping it will still be good for my grades.
