I bought alcohol yesterday.  Kistaro wanted me to estimate how long it would last, so after inquiring about the size of one of our glasses (2 ounces) and comparing it to the size of the liquor bottle (59.17 ounces), I estimated that the bottle would last 6 weeks.  That's one serving per day on weekdays and nothing on weekends.

Kistaro complained that I loaded the freezer up just before starting a fast.  Accordingly, I have modified my fasting plan to accommodate Kistaro, and I will eat a little bit from the freezer every day until I have cleared the stuff I bought for it.  I'm not sure how I'll clear the pizza that I bought; I think that one will have to wait until I am no longer fasting.  I am not yet capable of eating pizza in a temperant fashion.

One of my Theoma notes that I keep on my desk is outdated, I have discovered.  It refers to a continent that I no longer have on the map (Ilirra) and fails to refer to a continent that I do have on the map (Tachamund).  It isn't helpful to keep on my desk and I've put it into storage.  I started to throw it in the recycling, but I couldn't bear to.  It feels archaeological.  It's a record of a different phase of my planning.

I think I need another continent, too.  Ormeri is truly massive compared to all of the others, but the central desert can't be the same society as the relatively lush western side of the continent.  If I separate out the western side, it can be its own continent to visit.  For that matter, the icy bit north of the Ormeri desert could be its own continent.  It's almost as big as Niazon.  That would be two more continents on the map.

Eee, I now have a little shelf for all my candy.  It is mostly full with the items I have.  I could fill it the rest of the way, but I would just be stuffing the spare space with more Peeps, so that is not too exciting.  Most of my Peeps reserve can remain in the closet.
