I have worshipped at my altar of candies a few times.  It's not like I expect it to have a supernatural protective power of any kind, it's just that kneeling by it and contemplating it, or even prostrating myself before it in delicious meditation, is just so fun!  The [[Candy-Vault]] was one of my most hedonic ideas yet, even though it SLOWED my rate of sweets consumption!  Three cheers for the candy vault!  Three cheers for the hoard of candy!

I am too self-conscious to worship my candy altar while Kistaro is nearby.  It is a secret.  Sort of.  Except I'm publishing it to the world in this form.  But that's okay, I don't have any crazy fans reading my every thought.  Not that will ADMIT to it, anyways!  So it's just going down into a highly unnecessary historic record.

Not counting fine chocolate shops, I've exhausted the local area for chocolates.  There are still candies I haven't been hoarding, but nothing I still want.  The nearest fine chocolate shop scared me off by pressing a sample onto me one time when I went there, and I never found anything in their selection that I especially wanted to try.  I don't want to pay their prices...  I guess I am a low-market chocolate person.  Maybe mid-market?  I don't want Hershey's; the only Hershey's item in my hoard is a "plant-based" one that I hope will have a non-standard flavor.  Still, fine chocolates seem too expensive to me...

Hm.  The local fine chocolate shop closes on Sundays.  I can't ask about their "Florentine bars" today.  See, I checked their website, and there were a few items that looked appealing... if I ignored their pricetag.  The Florentine bars not only looked appealing, they were four dollars each, minimum increment two.  That sounded reasonable.  I'd want to see them in person - I suspect they're tiny! - but I was intending to buy some for my hoard.  No luck!

Maybe I should bike to Issaquah...  tomorrow.

I caught myself reaching for the tequila that I bought recently.  I'd forgotten that I hadn't decided on two ounces a day, I had decided on two ounces a day *except weekends*.  This being a weekend, I had to stop myself.

I stopped recording my weight because doing so made me feel anorexic.  Despite that, with the help of fasting, I've managed to get my weight moving in the right direction.

I was up all night last night with backpain.  I mean, not literally up, but I felt it even in my dreams.  It hurt a lot and I was helpless to do anything about it.  I didn't feel rested in the morning.  I still don't.

This book on the Silk Road that I'm reading gives me the impression that the Silk Road was largely a myth.  Trade was small-scale and the major conduits for ideas were migrations.  Where trade cropped up, it was often driven by large military movements, and so were migrations as people fled the brainless brutality of the era...  History is depressing.

I have just bought four packs of Oreos.  The flavors rotate, yes?  So I should try them all.  I am very familiar with the flavor of Oreos.  I dislike the basic Oreo.  This is a pure "try everything" extension.  I have not bought into the sub-flavors much before.  I've tried the lemon, and I think I've tried the mint, but now I'll try them again.  I certainly haven't tried the "java chip" flavor.  This purchase goes with my existing "toffee crunch" purchase.  Hail the candy vault!

I have also just eaten a scoop of Huel.  My last canister of Huel... "strawberry shortcake" flavor.  It is a very balanced nutritional source.  Not eating makes me nervous about my nutrition.  Eating a scoop of Huel calms that, and it isn't a lot of calories.
