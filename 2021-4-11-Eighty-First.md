Philosophically, I've only hated one person.  There has only ever been one person whose prosperity I didn't value.  There has only ever been one person who I wanted to see fail, suffer, and die; there has only ever been one person who I felt could harm me by prospering.  I got over that.  This sub-entry in this post is not about that person.

Colloquially, or at least in the way that I think to myself, I've hated almost everyone I've ever met.  In this sense hatred is a wish for peaceful separation... well, no, it's a dislike and a distrust.  It's a base of bad expectations, which results in a wish for peaceful separation.  It's not a philosophical hatred, because it's not a wish for them to suffer, nor would I feel harmed by their prosperity.

...I felt like I needed to say that to introduce what I was going to say next, but I don't know how to link it gracefully to what I want to talk about, so...  Eh...  I'm thinking about grade school.  I'm wondering if *anyone who went through it with me also remembers it*.  The surprising thing about me is that I didn't turn out *worse*, statistically speaking...  I just... have this intuition that I could never talk to anyone I knew in grade school, if I hoped to get any kind of... recognition.  No matter how much they valued peace, they would only know *me*, not... that our grade school was awful.  And strange.  I felt very relieved when I looked at a satellite image and saw it had all been torn down.  I'll always remember somewhere in that school which I've never found on any map.

Someone who wasn't quite honest enough to speak directly made references that I think were to me which were about guardian forces and Irvine, the sniper from FF8.  I feel like that's relevant to this.  I tried not to engage with that, and in all likelihood I engaged bitterly in the moment, but I've wondered whether I'm supposed to be the one who has the memory or the memory gaps.  Am I Irvine Kinneas or Squall Leonhart in this story?  Gotta be Irvine, right?  I talk about memories that I think other people don't have.

Yet if anyone has summoned "guardian forces", surely it'd have to be me; I've done summonings, and I'm not who I was.

It was hard to figure out what that referencing was supposed to be about.  I wish I'd been harassed by people who would talk out their references!  Though I guess it wouldn't have been harassment if they'd peacefully talked it through.  Possibly the reference was being forced by someone who didn't know or wouldn't admit that it couldn't survive the light of a fair examination.  Maybe it doesn't apply at all.

In FF8, one of the plotpoints is that the party has all met before, but can't remember it... except Irvine, who finds being thrown together with the others (again) deeply unsettling, and moreso because they treat him like a stranger.  He was the only member of the party who had been averse to summoning guardian forces, and in that setting, summoning GFs results in losing old memories.  In years of departure then, when they came back together...  Irvine remembered the others, but they didn't remember him.

It doesn't really matter...  I shouldn't be thinking about it.  Although I do love FF8, as a game; I never got past the third disk, despite which it's one of my favorite games.

What if Brooke doesn't remember me?  I'm reasonably confident that she would never forget *that I exist*, but what if she doesn't remember how she treated me, and is not today the kind of person who would treat anyone that way?  Would the Brooke who exists today then still be 'guilty'?

Vellos once told me that herms were playthings among his species.  He also once gifted me a 3D printed egg, but rebuffed my attempts to engage with him in an artisanal way.  I identified as hermaphroditic to him, and I guess he couldn't perceive a hermaphrodite as anything but a whore.  He wasn't happy about that, but I guess that shows how deeply entrenched misconceptions can be.

Imagine if a man who could only see women as sex objects was also himself disinterested in sex, but then he met a woman who was likewise disinterested in sex... and he could not then perceive her as anything but a sex object.
