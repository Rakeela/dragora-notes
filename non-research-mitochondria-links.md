# Non Research Mitochondria Links

Although this is generically about mitochondria, I currently intend to link this node off of [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]] for organizational reasons.  For graph organization reasons, I will also link it to [[mitochondria-research-findings-by-others]] and [[low-salience-mitochondria-research]].

If mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own DNA, what controls their rate of replication? How much do they depend on their host cell for biochemical machinery?

(I found this while trying to look up information about what controls mitochondrial replication.)

Apparently, HeLa cells are already used for breeding human mitochondrial populations, and I'll have to surpass them in productivity to have a real advance:
