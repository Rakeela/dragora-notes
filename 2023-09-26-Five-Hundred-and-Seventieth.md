12:41.  

21:59.  I did nothing of note today.  Okay, I watched like two episodes of Owl House.  I didn't like it.  Spider humor, vore humor, gross out humor.  It leaves me feeling hollow and defeated.  I probably gained a level in Starfield, too.  Who's tracking that?  I kept up my nationstates puppets for another day.  I did a bit of arguing, trying to shine a light towards a better world.  Did I do anything else?  I finished reading You Are the Splendor, the second 'evil' book in my collection.  I wrote a social media post that I deleted and rewrote.

(This part added the next day.)  I also watched three episodes of Helluva Boss last night.  I like that much better than Owl House.  Uh, usual catch-up stuff...  7.5 miles.  1,380 kcal.  28,122 steps.  6 hours, 22 minutes, and 24 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.
