6:10.  I got up at 6:00.  I haven't done anything from my typical morning routine yet.

6:16.  40,470.

6:25.  40,574.  104 words progress.

6:42.  40,843.  I'm feeling a little more inspired today.

6:51.  40,937.  Taking a break from writing.  Morning stuff!  I skipped it.

7:43.  Doing a few toe-touches tends to make me feel better and healthier.  I just did 5.  Nationstates is done with for the moment... no, wait.  I forgot a nation.

8:03.  Last nation complete on Nationstates.

8:05.  I'm really tired and out of it.  I'm going to set a forty-five minute timer and play Starfield for that duration.

8:55.  I didn't start the timer for 2-3 minutes, and then when the timer went off I ignored it and played for another minute or two.  Huzzah, 50 minute play session.  In that time, I completely surveyed a planet without a lot going on, and got most of the way through surveying another.

8:58.  Starfield has so much content.  Like wow, it really soaks up the hours.  I love the fantasy of going to poorly utilized places and exploring them to bring back research data.

9:00.  For that matter, I like the fantasy of going to places that were abandoned without being cleared out, and carrying back huge amounts of salvage from them.

9:02.  The fantasy of researching unexplored places is better though.  I often avoid the ruins that speckle every planet in Starfield.  The exploration is more fun.

10:35.  I have completed my no-crimes run of Liberal Crime Squad!  Almost no crimes.  Twice I accidentally set hackers to work, and accrued 4 charges of illegally accessing a computer system in the process.

10:56.  41,191.  721 words of progress.  I just got a great coupon for one of my favorite stores.  I'm tempted to go across town with my book in hand to visit there.  It's good exercise, it'll advance my reading of a hefty book, it'll take me away from an uncertain juncture in my writing.  I should get my quota today!
