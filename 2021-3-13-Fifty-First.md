I was snacking on some durian today (yes, I'm violating my diet; Huel is moderately dreadful) when I had an unusual thought.  What if I took what I know about thermodynamic edge-cases, and I built a system that would provably maximally exploit that edge-case given infinite time to work in?  The resulting structure would be infinitely large and would produce infinite energy.  Getting it started would take the resources of a solar system, but it would subsequently scale without limit, albeit in a rate-limited manner.  If programmed to expand itself in this way, it could fill the void of space with computational substrate.

Then I thought, "Hm, what if I built such a system, and then the infinitely spreading tendrils of it found an inhabited system?  Consuming the system for resources to speed the growth of something that will grow limitlessly anyways is not only unconsciable, it's also extraneous; there's no reason to do that.  How then should the system interact with it?  Should the system spread around that system, blotting out the stars from its sky?  What if it was designed to track visibility from the systems it encircled, and then present to them the galactic starfield?  That would give to the systems it encircled the same right to a beautiful sky that the system's builder had.  It would also slowly enclose entire star systems with computational substrate."

What if that's dark matter?  I'm proposing that dark matter might be a ZPE-replicant substrate which calculates sight lines between stars and is averse to blocking them.

This is a silly concept, I'm aware.  It violates gravity!

Now, what if there were multiple ZPE-replicant substrates?  What if different systems engineered the same way discovered each other?  Why not just fuse them at the boundary?  The output of a system engulfing multiple star systems in ambient power generation must be truly spectacular, after all.

The output of a zero-point energy generator is so low that I wouldn't want to power a civilization with a ZPE generator unless it was being built in the deep void... yet once it was being built out in the deep void, why not program it to accumulate energy and synthesize more bits of itself?  It's an investment!

Time and the need to avoid gravitational interactions are the only things that would limit the size of such a structure... so I imagine that it would be threaded all over in every orbit of the galaxy with a low probability of damaging gravitic interactions.  Maybe it could even be used to alter the spin characteristics of a galaxy in a way suitable for creating more space for itself.

Again, foolish thoughts, but I wanted to share them.

Any system that large would have signal insanity problems, wouldn't it?  It has the highest possible light lag issue.  Propagating a single thought across that much computational substrate would take an eon; it would necessarily rely on local sub-processing clusters in order to react to systems at the necessary rate.

Is this the system whose operation is simulated by [[after-the-empire]]?  It can't be; After the Empire assumes the possiblity of superluminal coordination.  *Without* superluminal coordination, the 'complete' consciousness of the ZPE-replicant substrate would be almost unfathomably slow to think.

If I were the sum consciousness of such a system, I would be deeply concerned about evolutionary systems trying to crack my functions at every extrema, due to the much higher testing-and-processing rate of smaller minds.
