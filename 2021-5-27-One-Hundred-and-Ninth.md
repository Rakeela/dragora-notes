I glanced out the window at the falling rain, and I looked at just the right moment, when the rain was falling hard enough to limit visibility.  An astonishing sight.  I hurried to open the blinds and get a better look at it, but by the time I had the blinds open the intensity of the rainfall had fallen to a more ordinary level.  Which, I suppose, I should be grateful for.  At the higher intensity there would have been flooding.  Better to have only seen it briefly.
