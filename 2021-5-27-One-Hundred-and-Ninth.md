I glanced out the window at the falling rain, and I looked at just the right moment, when the rain was falling hard enough to limit visibility.  An astonishing sight.  I hurried to open the blinds and get a better look at it, but by the time I had the blinds open the intensity of the rainfall had fallen to a more ordinary level.  Which, I suppose, I should be grateful for.  At the higher intensity there would have been flooding.  Better to have only seen it briefly.

When as a child, I cried about how "nothing happened" during summer vacation, I was actually crying about stuff that did happen which caused me to develop temporary memory blocks.  I had nothing I could talk about, in the social sense.

I really disliked my mother constantly trying to take me places, but not as much as I disliked her leaving me in the care of my sister, Brooke.  I think the final straw that lead to my disowning my mother was when she accused me of treating her as just "fun Mom" who always had to entertain me.  It was like...  Mom, you were *never* entertaining to me.  The only vacation spot we went to that was at all cool was that medieval tourney place.  The rest of the time I felt dragged around, discomfited, and kept from doing stuff that I found fun.

Mom thought I was treating her as "fun Mom" obligated to entertain me...  but I thought of it as being obligated to entertain *her*, and tag along after her whether I wanted to or not.

If I'd spent all summer every summer reading books, the "what did you do over the summer" essays would've just been extemporaneous book reports.  I would've been happy about that.  I was really happy about the summer where I read [[Battlefield Earth]]...  I need to add that to my [[Bibliography]], as I profoundly did read it.

Thinking about this in terms of The Viceroy, I think it leans me against "Leisure Subsidies" as a technology.  No, don't subsidize leisure, or at least not in the same tech block as natalism!  That stuff is for adults who need novelty to keep their brains sharp.  If everything is already new...  everything is already new.  A lot of adults seem to stagnate awfully and could use being reminded that life can be good.

I wanted the Panarchy upbringing.  I preferred my father's conversations, *and* his diatribes.  I've complained about them forever and yet I liked my mother's diatribes more than I liked her idea of fun outings.  I liked being taught about the world by my parents.  That's more the Panarchic Symposium than the Leisure Subsidy.

God, why was my childhood self not allowed to exist in this world?  If I fail at bringing immortality to this world and have to suffer reincarnation, I hope I get born to parents who will talk a lot and teach me their worldview.
