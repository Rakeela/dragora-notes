#character gallery 

This is a gallery of some of the past characters that I've used for roleplaying.  This is only a small fraction of the characters I've played, focusing on a few that I consider especially worth preserving.

This is not a gallery of all characters that I'm currently or potentially using.  I will not upload such a thing save in the improbable event that I decide to transfer(/duplicate) ALL of my writing to this medium.

_Past Roleplaying Character Gallery_
* **Chimes:**
	* Fifty two thin silver rectangular plates, completely blank and featureless.  Capable of flying with no obvious levitation source, and of stacking up neatly like a pack of playing cards when not in motion.  Every plate makes a different sound if struck, and Chimes can communicate only by striking its plates together to make music.
	* Friendly and a good listener, but not very talkative.
	* Potentially mistakable for a whirling ball of blades while performing musically.
* **Yoet:**
	* An otter in a ruined and helmetless suit of high-tech hazard armor whose many unhealing wounds weep a silvery nanoreplicant goo that causes psychosis on contact.  Yoet is a chemist in an era that solved all known problems in her field and produced standard automation for all chemicals of known interest.  Lacking interest in other fields and feeling utterly irrelevant in her own, Yoet is consumed by a drifting rootless search for the meaning of life, driving her to dangerous experiments that (arguably) do nothing to answer her questions.  Half mad and dangerously unhuggable, she is nevertheless utterly nonviolent.
	* Disappointed to be misunderstood and in truth quite hard to comprehend, she has never made friends who comprehend or even recognize her search for meaning.  Which never stopped it from happening, it just meant that there's a lot more wandering alone through abandoned places involved, and more writing of poems unlikely to ever be read.
	* Sometimes seen wearing dressed wounds; sometimes even with healed wounds and a white laboratory outfit replacing her broken hazard armor.  It's little more than changing outfits to her.  She doesn't understand why anyone would care, and resents cleaning up for an irrelevant society that can't understand any of her interests.  It isn't like she can /die/ of nanite infestation.  Is she supposed to keep herself in a pleasant state for lovers in a sexualized eternity?  
	* She doesn't have a better answer than the search for love, but it dissatisfies her like everything else.  Hypersexual areas are a ruin to her, too.  They're just another kind of bleak disconnection.  Everything is forlorn to her, though some of it is beautiful.
	* Cutesy areas are the worst.  Implausible.  Mindless.  Unincisive!  And bizarrely hazardous, in the context of her own setting.  The cute areas are the ones that might mind wipe dissidents!  Yoet is scared of that, and finds it far more intimidating than merely being perpetually eaten alive by a mind-wrecking nanoswarm that is trying to wipe her mind.  Those are *her* nanites.  She's *used* to them.
* **Syra:**
	* A giant ever-burning bird of prey, surrounded by an aura of fire that can burn no living thing, but indeed heals whatever it touchs.  Syra has no origin and no ambitions, but exists as an embodied prayer of healing upon reality's imperturbable spiritual edge... despite which she occasionally seeks conversation, and is curious about society as a place in which she does not live.  Theoretically, she's very dangerous, but she's really gentle and friendly.
	* A wandering observer like Yoet, but much happier about it.  Wherever Syra goes, she's the tranquil epicenter of several meters of absolute safety where everyone being licked by her flames is soon in vibrant perfect health - at least for a while.
	* Not an anthro bird.  Feral bird.
* **Amadea:**
	* A clean gentle otter with thick soft fur and an elaborate wardrobe.  She's a farmer on paper, and her plow is a pencil; she's a well-educated aristocrat who wants the farm work done well without doing any of it herself.  Interested in the economy, the environment, and literate company.  Less prone to smelling like fish than most otters, some amount of farm stink is inevitable instead, just because she is actively engaged as a planner and overseer.  Some of that arises as well from the garden she tends with her own hands.
	* Although she's friendly to affection, Amadea is introverted.  Her interest in literate company is no idle commonality.  She expects to be able to maintain friendships with people by correspondence.
  * **Ihroun:**
	  * A shiny brown dragon (aka bronze) with bulky scales and a hormonal disorder.  Permanently stuck producing attractive pheromones and with her body adapted to keeping her own libido stuck 'on', she's a beacon to a species which does some of its flirting in chemicals.  She knows that she can say no to potential partners, or get medical treatment for her condition, but she says she likes sexual pleasure.  She claims that she's comfortable with being an infamous slut.
	  * Is she?
	  * Nowhere ever feels like home to her.  She wants to leave places so frequently that she sought an excuse rather than a career, and so became a magic-item courier.  She is proud to be "Ihroun the Courier", who is trusted and trustworthy with the transit of sacred items.
	  * Her father was a bad person.  He seduced an incompetent dragoness and then tried to move to a far-off isolated place to engage in childrearing as he thought he would most enjoy.  It worked for too many years, but then he was found, caught, and punished by a legendary healer who rescued Ihroun.
	  * Although she skinflints like she owns nothing and tries to get other people to pay for all her expenses, she also earns coinage and keeps it.  Privately, she practices a form of sacred fire magic, by melting down coins to form sculpture bases, and then trying to shape statues by controlling how the metal melts off the base.  It's a feat of precision pyrokinesis.  In this way she attempts to depict the people that she meets, mostly other dragons.
  * **Kettikita:**
	  * A hypermetabolic ottergryphon who is hyperactive in the 'trouble standing still' sense, though not in the 'chronically distracted' sense.  Kettikita enjoys exercise so much that she has the training dedication of an athlete, but she lacks the competitive drive.  She suffered through university to get a degree in exercise physiology instead; she's a sports doctor, and works to keep healthy the people who *do* have that competitive drive.
	  * Makes friends easily, but doesn't keep them; her overwhelming energy is a limiter on her social circle.
	  * Approximately no personal space bubble; comfortable in packed crowds.
	  * Her shiny, well-oiled feathers do actually leave her smelling like fish oil.  It's a sign of good health!


I may add more later.  I may try to add every character I can recall, eventually... though I doubt it.

Yoet was something of a first and last.  In hindsight, she was almost prophetic.  She felt pressured to keep herself in a pleasant state for lovers in a sexualized eternity... and lo, that was where I encountered bonobianism.  So it was like...  that was supposed to be the answer, huh?  Yoet couldn't put to words why that was dissatisfying to her, nor then could I.  I don't think I ever used her in a sexual scene, but I put away her qualms as I'd put away my own a few years earlier in pushing myself to adopt the presumption that sex would have true value.

Some of the characters I've only written about in private could use a space here, too.

_Private Writing Character Gallery_
  * **'Warlock':**
	  * A serene yet distractible fire elemental who resembles a weasel.  Her mind is brilliant, but disordered.  Is it disordered?  She misses nothing.  She burns, but is yet peaceful.  Her life is a waking dream.
	  * A summon set free.  Give her no orders.  She moves at her whims.  Fast.  Stillness.  Fast again.
	  * [[Warlockisms]]

I can't use any of the following without transplanting them.  I will not likely use again the settings that they are from.  I have thought about this in the context of Amadea first, but I have realized that every character I add to this gallery has a kind of transplantation requirement profile as well.  I'm going to write that out here.

_Transplant Profile Gallery 1_
* **Chimes:**
  * Physics:  Chimes is an artifact creature.  It requires some kind of no-profile source of mobility, and can only exist in fantasy settings or the softest sci-fi.
  * Society:  Pacifist.  No war stories for Chimes.  It is never actually a whirling ball of blades.
* **Yoet:**
  * Physics:  Yoet self-identifies as a chemist, but we would probably consider her a nanotechnician.  She can only exist in settings with advanced nanotechnology.
  * Society:  Ennui.  No crisis stories for Yoet.  Her character exists in the uncertainty.
* **Syra:**
  * Physics:  Syra is a blazing firebird most suitable for high fantasy environments, though religious/superstitious nanotechnology might suffice instead.
  * Society:  No particular requirements need to be met for her character to exist, but consider the impact of her ambient healing power on the rest of the story.
* **Amadea**
  * Physics:  Extremely primitive environments are out, but most historic settings have sufficient technology.
  * Society:  Not fanatic egalitarianism.  Amadea can exist anywhere from severely stratified to moderately egalitarian societies, but extreme egalitarianism bars the existence of the landlord-farmer.

The following is for less forbidding transplant profiles.  I may conceivably use the following in their original settings, but I'm adding notes for use in other settings as well.

_Transplant Profile Gallery 2_
 * **Ihroun:**
	 * Physics:  Something needs to enable her isolation, and something needs to enable her rescue.  Very advanced settings are good at enabling rescue, but would tend to block the initial isolation, whereas primitive settings are good at enabling isolation, but make the rescue improbable.
	 * Society:  Ihroun can only exist in a flawed/incomplete sex-positive society.  A complete sex-positive society would not contain the character of her father, but a sex-negative society would not contain the character of her rescuer!  Nor would a sex-negative society tolerate Ihroun's ambivalently positive attitude towards sexuality.
 * **Kettikita:**
	 * Physics:  Advanced enough to have sports doctors.  No other requirements.
	 * Society:  No war stories.  Hyperfitness is a great trait for a soldier, but Kettikita is not a soldier, and would be horrified to be told she has the genes for it.  Beyond that, Kettikita's transient social patterns can only exist in an urban society.
