#character gallery 

This is a gallery of some of the past characters that I've used for roleplaying.  This is only a small fraction of the characters I've played, focusing on a few that I consider especially worth preserving.

This is not a gallery of all characters that I'm currently or potentially using.  I will not upload such a thing save in the improbable event that I decide to transfer(/duplicate) ALL of my writing to this medium.

_Past Roleplaying Character Gallery_
* **Chimes:**
	* Fifty two thin silver rectangular plates, completely blank and featureless.  Capable of flying with no obvious levitation source, and of stacking up neatly like a pack of playing cards when not in motion.  Every plate makes a different sound if struck, and Chimes could communicate only by striking its plates together to make music.
	* Friendly and a good listener, but not very talkative.
	* Potentially mistakable for a whirling ball of blades while performing musically.
* **Yoet:**
	* An otter in a ruined and helmetless suit of high-tech hazard armor whose many unhealing wounds wept a silvery nanoreplicant goo that caused psychosis on contact.  Yoet was a chemist in an era that solved all known problems in her field and produced standard automation for all chemicals of known interest.  Lacking interest in other fields and feeling utterly irrelevant in her own, Yoet became consumed by a drifting rootless search for the meaning of life, driving her to dangerous experiments that did nothing to answer her questions.  Half mad and dangerously unhuggable, but utterly nonviolent.
	* Disappointed to be misunderstood and in truth quite hard to comprehend, she couldn't make friends who comprehended or even recognized her search for meaning.  Which didn't stop it from happening, it just meant that there was a lot more wandering alone through ruined places involved, and more writing of poems unlikely to ever be read.
	* Sometimes seen wearing dressed wounds; sometimes even with healed wounds and a white laboratory outfit replacing her broken hazard armor.  It was little more than changing outfits to her.  She didn't understand why anyone would care, and resented cleaning up for an irrelevant society that couldn't understand any of her interests.  It wasn't like she could /die/ of nanite infestation.  Was she supposed to keep herself in a pleasant state for lovers in a sexualized eternity?  
	* She didn't have a better answer than the search for love, but it dissatisfied her like everything else.  The hypersexual areas were a ruin to her, too.  They were just another kind of bleak disconnection.  Everything was forlorn to her, though some of it was beautiful.
	* Cutesy areas were the worst.  Implausible.  Mindless.  Unincisive!  And bizarrely hazardous, in the context of her setting.  The cute areas were the ones that would mind wipe dissidents!  Yoet was scared of that, and found it far more intimidating than merely being perpetually eaten alive by a mind-wrecking nanoswarm that was trying to wipe her mind.  Those were *her* nanites.  She was *used* to them.
* **Syra:**
	* A giant ever-burning bird of prey, surrounded by an aura of fire that could burn no living thing, but indeed healed whatever it touched.  Syra had no origin and no ambitions, but existed as an embodied prayer of healing upon reality's imperturbable spiritual edge... despite which she occasionally sought conversation, and was curious about society as a place in which she did not live.  Theoretically very dangerous, but really gentle and friendly.
	* A wandering observer like Yoet, but much happier about it.  Wherever Syra went, she was the tranquil epicenter of several meters of absolute safety where everyone being licked by her flames was soon in vibrant perfect health - at least for a while.
	* Not an anthro bird.  Feral bird.
* **Amadea:**
	* A clean gentle otter with thick soft fur and an elaborate wardrobe.  She's a farmer on paper, and her plow is a pencil; she's a well-educated aristocrat who wants the farm work done well without doing any of it herself.  Interested in the economy, the environment, and literate company.  Less prone to smelling like fish than most otters, some amount of farm stink is inevitable instead, just because she is actively engaged as a planner and overseer.  Some of that arises as well from the garden she tends with her own hands.
	* Although she's friendly to affection, Amadeus is introverted.  Her interest in literate company is no idle commonality.  She expects to be able to maintain friendships with people by correspondence.
  * **Ihroun:**
	  * A shiny brown dragon (aka bronze) with bulky scales and a hormonal disorder.  Permanently stuck producing attractive pheromones and with her body adapted to keeping her own libido stuck 'on', she was a beacon to a species which does some of its flirting in chemicals.  She could still have said no to potential partners, or gotten medical treatment for her condition, but she said she liked sexual pleasure.  She claimed to be comfortable with being an infamous slut.
	  * Sterile.  That also could have been fixed; she refused.
	  * Nowhere ever felt like home to her.  She wanted to leave places so frequently that she sought an excuse rather than a career, and so became a magic-item courier.  She was "Ihroun the Courier", proud to be trusted and trustworthy with the transit of sacred items.
	  * She skinflinted like she owned nothing and tried to get other people to pay for all her expenses, but she earned coin and kept it.  Privately, she practiced a form of sacred fire magic, by melting down coinage to form sculpture bases, and then trying to shape statues by controlling how the metal melted off the base.  In this way she attempted to depict people that she met, mostly other dragons.
	  * Her father was a bad person who tried to move to a far-off isolated place to raise kids, but he got caught and punished by a goddess, who rescued Ihroun and tried to heal her.  The goddess eventually tried to offer more healing than Ihroun was willing to accept.
  
I may add more later.  I may try to add every character I can recall, eventually... though I doubt it.  Yoet was something of a first and last.  In hindsight, she was almost prophetic.  She felt pressured to keep herself in a pleasant state for lovers in a sexualized eternity... and lo, that was where I encountered bonobianism.  So it was like...  that was supposed to be the answer, huh?  Yoet couldn't put to words why that was dissatisfying to her, nor then could I.  I don't think I ever used her in a sexual scene, but I put away her qualms as I'd put away my own a few years earlier in pushing myself to adopt the presumption that sex would have true value.

I can't use any of these without transplanting them.  I will not likely use again the settings that they are from.  I have thought about this in the context of Amadeus first, but I have realized that every character I add to this gallery has a kind of transplantation requirement profile as well.  I'm going to write that out here.

_Transplant Profile Gallery_
* **Chimes:**
  * Physics:  Chimes is an artifact creature.  It requires some kind of no-profile source of mobility, and can only exist in fantasy settings and the softest sci-fi.
  * Society:  Pacifist.  No war stories for Chimes.  It is never actually a whirling ball of blades.
* **Yoet:**
  * Physics:  Yoet self-identifies as a chemist, but we would probably consider her a nanotechnician.  She can only exist in settings with advanced nanotechnology.
  * Society:  Ennui.  No crisis stories for Yoet.  Her character exists in the uncertainty.
* **Syra:**
  * Physics:  Syra is a blazing firebird most suitable for high fantasy environments, though religious/superstitious nanotechnology might suffice instead.
  * Society:  No particular requirements need to be met for her character to exist, but consider the impact of her ambient healing power on the rest of the story.
* **Amadeus**
  * Physics:  Extremely primitive environments are out, but most historic settings have sufficient technology.
  * Society:  Not fanatic egalitarianism.  Amadeus can exist anywhere from severely stratified to moderately egalitarian societies, but extreme egalitarianism prevents the existence of the landlord-farmer.
