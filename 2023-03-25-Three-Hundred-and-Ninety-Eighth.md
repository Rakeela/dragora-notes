Morning weigh-in:  244.7 pounds

Yesterday's reading must have been erroneously low.  This one seems more correct for how bad at dieting I've been this week.  I'm going to continue dieting through the weekend.  I don't want to gain a bunch of weight that I'll later have to lose.

I just ate a beef and cheese burrito that contained neither beef, nor cheese, nor grain.  All three ingredients were substituted/faked with vegan components.  It was pretty tasty!

15.2 miles, 2,050 kcal, 40,311 steps, 6 hours, 25 minutes.  2.3 mph.  My right foot bled today.  My endurance is being limited by the point at which my body suffers injury.

I'm not really on my diet right now.  I ate a bunch of sweethearts today.  I want to rush to the store and buy candy, and be like, "I'm sorry!  I pretended I would diet on Saturday, but I really just want to eat sweets!  So I've instead eaten a pair of date bars.  That's what I ate today.  Sweethearts.  A microwave burrito.  A pair of date bars.  The date bars are amazing, but wow.  Not satiating at all.  Not good for protein either.  I really shouldn't eat them.

I've noticed that most nuts don't seem to provoke weight gain if I eat them while I'm ostensibly fasting, but peanuts are an exception.  Probably because they're legumes...  In any case, they're clearly very digestible.  I ate a spoonful of peanut butter just now.
