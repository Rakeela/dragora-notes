I don't feel good about dieting today.  My left hip hurts.  It's been coming on for several days, but I thought that inclination to limp was just because I was tired.  I'm worried that I'm not getting enough nutrients and my body is wasting away or something.

Thinking about that, I've eaten two Atkins candies and an Atkins protein bar.  They contain collagen or gelatin, and I'll never get to buy them again, because those are animal parts.  They were a violation of my vegetarianism all along!  I never knew.  But I'll keep eating them until they're gone.  Can't undo the purchase by throwing them out.

Morning weigh-in:  245.0 pounds.

Well, there's that.  My weight is definitely down since last week.

I drank my usual daily rum and (diet) cola, and I felt nauseated this time.  Bleh!  Alcohol tastes so bad.  I didn't throw up or anything, but the brief nausea was distinctive.

Nothing ever does better for inspiration than staring at what I've written until I think of the next thing to write.  Why can't I think through scenes more?  I can think ahead to what I want later in the story, but I can't write a scene in my head while doing other stuff.  I wish I could.

Evening weigh-in:  244.7 pounds.

I ate a pop-tart this evening.  Not a pack of pop-tarts.  Just one.
