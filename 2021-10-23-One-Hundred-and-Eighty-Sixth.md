#2021-10-23-One-One-Hundred-and-Eighty-Sixth

I've just figured out why the humans from my prior lifetime would have tortured captive dragons.  They needed to find our lairs to hunt us down.  Our lairs had scrollcases full of maps and agreements that would tell them everything about us and make it very hard for us to lie to them.

But I killed a bunch of them for doing it to me, and it shouldn't have worked ever.  We were shapeshifters!  Why didn't everyone think of dissolving their bonds?  We should've flowed out of restraints!

I wasn't conscious during that period except when they were doing something awful.  They must have had some way to force consciousness states so that escapes wouldn't happen.  There's too much magic here.  It frustrates me.
