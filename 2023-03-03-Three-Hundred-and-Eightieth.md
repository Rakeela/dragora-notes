Morning weigh-in:  241.0 pounds.

Around 4 AM, I ate a cookie and two veggie sausages, hoping it would reduce the amount of pain I woke up in.  I don't know if it did.  This is kind of a painful morning.

Today is a moderately hard day for fasting.  I'm about an hour and a half into my walking for today, and I keep wanting food.  The candy hoard behind me looks so good... even though I remember it well enough to also doubt I'd really enjoy eating into it.

I drank extra alcohol yesterday.  i don't count hard liquor into my diet.  I didn't get drunk.  I'm not sure if it helped or hurt my endurance.  My alcohol consumption has crept up lately.  I fear my liver may be producing excess glucose, and I'm trying to stop it.  I'm aware that trying to interfere with my liver is probably irrational.  If I drank as much every day as I did yesterday, I'd get alcoholic fatty liver for sure.  Even without "getting drunk" it was just too much.  The proper cure for excess glucose production from my liver is just hard dieting.  Excess glucose production is an insulin resistance problem.  If I can overcome obesity, my liver definitely won't produce excess glucose.  I think I'll skip my daily drink today.

20% of today's treadmill use is complete!

It's hard not to count the minutes.  I don't want to do this for nine hours again.  I do however want to eventually get fit enough to complete a marathon in under nine hours.  I'm not there yet.  That fitness goal feels "out there" and implausible, yet somehow people complete marathons in *six* hours.  Nine hours isn't even a "real" marathon goal.

Marathoners can run for hours.  Oh my god how.  People around me find walking for nine hours impressive.  I'm obviously not in a marathon-running community.

33% of today's treadmill use is complete!  Time for a bathroom break, and I'm going to weigh myself again.  Aaaaand...  241.4 pounds.  If there's an immediate weight drop from exercise, I've been overcoming it with enthusiastic hydration.

I'm trying to break yesterday's distance record with another 9 hour session.  This time at higher speed.

40%!  I stepped off the treadmill briefly and poked around in the kitchen, but the cookie I ate this morning is really all the calories I get, I think.  I can only eat 'freebies' now, things I don't count, which are mostly cheese.  I don't want cheese right now.

1,566 words on the file.

I've completed 25,139 steps.  My feet really hurt.  I'm going to take a moment to moisturize and massage my feet.  Done.  Once more into the breach...  Ow.  This speed is kinda difficult.  2.6 mph at present.  It's not fast enough.  I need to go at 3 mph all day long to complete a 9 hour marathon.  I just can't do it yet.

1,885 words on the file.  319 words of progress.  I'm stuck in a conversation that is yielding up lore.

50% of my duration target passed!  I've gone 10.2 miles and walked 28,545 steps.

5 hours.  4 hours remain.  11.5 miles.  1,581 kcal.  31,944 steps.

5 hours, 20 minutes, 36 seconds.  Pausing.  12.3 miles.  1,685 kcal.  33,954 steps.  I'm getting really haggard.  Hungry, too.  My legs hurt.  I've gotta sit down for a minute.

Okay.  You know how I was worried that my liver might be producing excess glucose?  I'm less worried about that today.  I'm probably working from the glucose my liver produces.  At least in part.  What's the role of ketones, again?  How much can the muscles work from fatty acids?  I don't know enough about metabolism.

Well, I've had a chance to recover.  Time to get back to the grind.  Part of the problem is the speed I'm walking at.  2.6 mph disrupts me.  It's harder to type, even a little harder to read.  I have to keep myself distracted or the time crawls.  Distraction is harder this time.

6 hours.  3 hours remain.  14.0 miles.  1,910 kcal.  38,282 steps.  Ow.  This is freaking hard.  Should I eat something?  I don't think I will, but I'm wondering.  If I just wanted to hit the record and beat my distance, I'd definitely aim for a 200 calorie meal right now.  Am I adapting my body to burn fat by exercising without eating?  In any case, I've had to take more breaks during the fifth hour... but I turned the speed *up* instead of *down*.  I gotta get to 3 mph eventually.

6 hours, 18 minutes.  I'm at 2,013 kcal.  I've broken 2k!  That makes me feel like I've only got 1/5th of the walk left to go, though I expect to burn more than yesterday's total today.  I'm over 40k steps, too!

6 hours, 30 minutes.  15.4 miles.  2,083 kcal.  41,643 steps.  Taking a break.  I have to take so many breaks.  I hope I can actually complete this tonight.  I just told Bhijn that I'd walk more than 17 miles today, but I have my doubts.  And I just weighed myself again, 240.2 pounds.  All this exercise and I feel like I would've lost this much just not eating.

Man though, I think I oughta eat a protein bar when I'm done.  I think my body needs more than those amino acid pills I've been taking.  Maybe I ought to slow down the speed of the treadmill...  I'm not ready for 2.7 mph!  But if I slow down, I'll never get to 3.0 mph!

7 hours.  2 hours remain.  Maybe I'll get through this.  But wow, I am hungry.  I want that protein bar now.  Are my muscles going to be okay with waiting until tomorrow?  Am I even going to get enough protein tomorrow?  I eat pretty unhealthy foods.  Come to think of it, I'm obviously going to have enough time and energy to hit 17 miles, because I'm already at 16.7 miles.  I might not complete the full 9 hours, but I'm going to go to the store and buy some fava and garbanzo bean salad.  It'll be a healthy, delicious thing to eat... tomorrow.  Or tonight, if my will breaks, or if I convince myself that waiting will cost me progress.  And I want the extended break with a change in my surroundings.  I'll come back refreshed and ready to tackle the next hour.

7 hours, 15 minutes.  I bought two kinds of cookies.  Birthday cake soft top cookies, and smores girl scout cookies.  I also bought the fava bean salad.  I've never had birthday cake soft top cookies and I want to try every variety of those, so I feel happy with that purchase.  Meanwhile, I didn't know that girl scout cookies included a smores variety.  It seems like there's always more to eat in this world.  New things to try are hyper-abundant!  I can lose weight while filling my Saturdays with sweets!

7 hours, 30 minutes.  2,426 kcal estimated burn.  18.0 miles.  About 48,500 steps.  Fewer steps and greater distance than yesterday.  My stride must be longer today.

7 hours, 42 minutes, 14 seconds.  18.6 miles.  2,497 kcal burned.  49,9112 steps.  Kistaro has persuaded me to stop for the night.  Average speed 2.4 mph.

I ate the fava bean sala and a single bite of a cookie.
