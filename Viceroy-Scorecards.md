#Viceroy-Scorecards

The voices in my head have been obsessed with this game, and I think it's because the people who stalked me when I stopped putting out cybersexually (supposedly because I'm a sexual predator and/or white nationalist and/or primitivist and/or religious nut, but I'm an asexual liberal transhumanist atheist f'real) are desperate to find excuses to hate me.  I think there's something seriously transhumanly wrong.

Anyways, they made a fascinating claim that I'd love to reality check, because reality checking the voices makes them pull back for a while and be just... schizophrenic for a while.  I can handle being schizophrenic, annoying as it is, and if I can ever get the voices to accept that they're really just a manifestation of schizophrenia I will get back to being a transhuman *researcher* again.  God.  I briefly got into actual research work and the annoying noises surged into actual voices.  (They claimed that they were trying to harass me into primitivism, and maybe that's why beeping at me with constant hallucinatory server room noises came before the actual voices.)

...anyway anyway, beg pardon for the mental chaos (seriously why are you reading this page), I want to reality check their claim that the "Weight of Culture" in the game is non-random.  That's my first "Scorecard".  If I remember, when I complete maps, I'll post their Weight of Culture results along with what faction they were for.

Supposedly, according to the voices in my head, the Commonwealth Unifiers are the Most Peaceful Faction, and the Panarchic Ritualists are the Most Violent Faction.  I don't think the game is built that way.

Note that Bureaucratic Overhead in the Weight of Culture (which this measures) is itself a measure of how many turns in the game has gotten.
