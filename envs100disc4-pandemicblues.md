# Envs100disc4 PandemicBlues

This one's a potential personal challenge.  I've always had trouble accounting for myself, and in this case I've got an unusual narrative in the wrong direction.

The pandemic was a pure improvement to my quality of life.  I'm not about to object to moving out, but I've been living on the silver cloud.  We're fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies!  That's the tech to do a bunch of really cool stuff that we couldn't do yet because RNA vaccines self-limit as the immune system responds to them.  Now we're trying out new prototype RNA vaccination technologies in massive scale trials which should cure COVID-19 whether or not they fix the weaknesses with our previous generation of RNA vaccination technologies.  If that self-limiting factor in RNA vaccination does get fixed by the current research push, we can start rolling out allergy vaccinations to the public to fix a myriad of petty quality of life issues which afflict them.

Allergies risk sounding like a petty focus in this context, but I think it's a very important aspect of humanity's medical potentials.  The improved sense of health from curative allergy treatments would be universally available as well as providing a nice little karmic boost for removing allergies as a topic that can divide people in misery.  Freed of the weight of allergens, some of the people who are presently of marginal productivity will become more competent in their lives without need for the application of psychological change pressures.  People are both happier and more productive when they aren't suffering allergy symptoms.  Even some of the interpersonal hatred that comes between people can be resolved by interventions like this.  How many people in this world are hated because they are "doing nothing"?  Are any of those people unproductive because their life forces them into frequent exposures to allergens?  A medical system that can fix allergies can make those individuals productive even as it alleviates their stresses.  How often are people harder to tolerate due to a flaw as politely unmentionable and ethically irrelevant as a bad personal odor?  Are any of the malodorous people stuck in that state due to undiscovered food allergies, or allergic responses to nearly-unavoidable foods like grain?  A medical system that can fix allergies can help those people achieve the social respect they deserve.

Looking forward to changing technology is a little like looking at the bright side of all things.  It is horrible that people suffer of disease, but on the other hand every advance in our biotechnical capabilities can bring forth wonders.  Our society has more to gain in cohesion and beauty within the next few years for that the work being done to cure this plague is being done today.  We are increasing our ability to target the molecular machinery of pathogens, and in that process we are gaining permanent advantage in all contest against disease, which force cannot forever survive against the might of human medical capabilities.  We need only ensure that a sufficient force is brought to bear against it.  Every barrier in this world formed of faulty medical conditions can in time be dissolved should we have the will to reach for their dissolution.
