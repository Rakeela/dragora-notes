# Envs100disc4 PandemicBlues

First draft:
This one's a potential personal challenge.  I've always had trouble accounting for myself, and in this case I've got an unusual narrative in the wrong direction.  Y'see, the pandemic was a pure improvement to my quality of advice.  I'm not about to object to moving out, but I've been living on the silver cloud.

I tell you, there is good news to be found in this global nightmare.  Far from the world of political stresses, humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies[]!  That's the tech to do a bunch of really cool stuff previously impossible for humanity due to self-limiting factors in human immunoresponse to RNA vaccinations[].  Now we're trying out new prototype RNA vaccination technologies[] in massive scale trials which should cure COVID-19 whether or not they fix the weaknesses with our previous generation of RNA vaccination technologies.  If that self-limiting factor in RNA vaccination does get fixed by the efforts of scientists involved in the current research push, we can do more than just cure COVID-19.  We can also start rolling out allergy vaccinations[] to the public to fix a myriad of petty quality of life issues which afflict them.

Allergies risk sounding like a petty focus in this context, but I think it's a very important aspect of humanity's medical potential.  The improved sense of health from curative allergy treatments would be universally available as well as providing a nice little karmic boost for removing allergies as a topic that can divide people in misery.  Freed of the weight of allergens, some of the people who are presently of marginal productivity will become more competent in their lives without need for the application of psychological change pressures[].  People are both happier and more productive when they aren't suffering allergy symptoms[].  Even some of the interpersonal hatred that comes between people can be resolved by interventions like this.  How many people in this world are hated because they are "doing nothing"[]?  Are any of those people unproductive because their life forces them into frequent exposures to allergens[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can make those individuals productive without handing a moral victory to people who were unduly pressuring them.  How often are people harder to tolerate due to a flaw as politely unmentionable and ethically irrelevant as a bad personal odor[]?  Are any of the malodorous people stuck in that state due to undiscovered food allergies[], or allergic responses to nearly-unavoidable foods like grain[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can help those people achieve the social respect they deserve.

Looking forward to changing technology is a little like looking at the bright side of all things.  It is horrible that people suffer of disease, but on the other hand every advance in our biotechnical capabilities can bring forth wonders.  Our society has more to gain in cohesion and beauty within the next few years for that the work being done to cure this plague is being done today.  We are increasing our ability to target the molecular machinery of pathogens, and in that process we are gaining permanent advantage in all contest against disease, which force cannot forever survive against the might of human medical capabilities.  We need only ensure that a sufficient force is brought to bear against it.  Every barrier in this world formed of faulty medical conditions can in time be dissolved should we but have the will to reach for their dissolution.

Whew.  This is going to be hard to author citations for.  I know where to find the research that I'm drawing from, but my citodensity is going to score another high as I try to bring people with technical minds into my excitement.  I'm starting to think I love the university environment.

Conceivably, it might be possible to cite that psychological change pressures make people unhappy.  I think I can probably cite something suggesting the unproductive are disliked.  Substantiating the claim that malorodousness impairs social standing would be straightforward and favorable although it is also fairly obvious, and I'm unsure where to find that information; I should also try to substantiate the technical claim that allergies can increase malodorousness.  The citation about unavoidable foods should be about substantiating a link between grain allergies and malodorousness, not about establishing the existence of grain allergies.

---
I feel emotionally overwhelmed by this assignment.  "I've always had trouble accounting for myself," is no idle statement.  Trying to describe my life in public school essays was nothing short of traumatic; it was a good way to make me cry an awful lot.
---

...I slept on it, and I still feel this way.  I'm not sure how to proceed with this draft.  The task of digging up the citations is mechanically straightforward.  If someone else had written this with the same citation gaps, I could easily look them up, fill them in, and consider it good work.  Yet it's my own, and that hurts.  I'm not saying anything I'm unhappy to say.  If I were posting it instantly without citations, I'd have no trouble.
---

This is important to me, and my default headspace isn't brandishing a diamond saw.  We don't have good personality editing tools available IRL (this reminds me of a story I wrote, [[The-Personality-Scavenge-Service]]), so I've been using cannabis instead.  It's a chaotic influence, but it's the only immediately available tool.  It does seem to be helping.  I've been at least holding at this task and I certainly feel like I'm developing a better response to it as I continue to record my thought processes ranging the vicinity.  The citation-lookup step has been very pleasant in my coursework generally, and it focuses on a task which I consider especially desirable both presently and historically in my life.  Here I have written an essay speaking of joy, and every citation it points towards is a citation for the possibility of a brighter future.  This is the silver lining and why the problem is getting better!  This is the good news!
---

Would it feel better if I redrafted it impersonally?  I think it would be incomprehensible.  It would go from impactful to barely relevant, *while* losing emotional coherency.   The good post here admits to pain, even if it's harder to write.
---

...maybe I need to take more steps to decompose the material.  If I take every citable claim and individually copy it into my notes below in this section, can I address them in a better way by removing them from the contextual weight of their paragraph?  Let's try it.

**Draft citation project iteration 1**
Citation needed:
humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies[]!
Initial Commentary:
1.  I think I increased the emotional weight of this task on myself by putting myself in a position of having to cite an exclamation point.  I understand it as a rhetorical decision, but I'm putting this down as a note to myself to be mindful of the increase in emotional challenge of authorship.
2.  The difficulty here is in the sub-claims, as established by the word 'fixing'.  For something to be fixed, it has to be broken.  Since I'm not even presuming my audience is familiar with RNA vaccines, I now have to establish both that the technology exists and that it is currently in need of fixing.
3.  Noting the existence of sub-claims clarifies that this sentence is a lede, and may be better uncited.  The paragraph establishes the lede of the paragraph, and the other citations can be for the purpose of the lede.
4.  The actual first sentence of the paragraph is an emotional tone-setting, and might be better off in the first paragraph where it is on topic rather than the second where it is not.

the null source
Conclusion pro tempore:
the null source
Concluding commentary:
1.  I don't need to cite the lede.
2.  I do need to make sure the rest of the citations in the paragraph establish everything that the lede requires to be true.

Citation needed:
That's the tech to do a bunch of really cool stuff previously impossible for humanity due to self-limiting factors in human immunoresponse to RNA vaccinations[].
Initial Commentary:
1.  I need to establish that self-limiting factors in human immunoresponse exist.
2.  I haven't established yet what RNA vaccinations are.
3.  This citation point is trying to do too much and needs to be rethought.
Suggested sources:
split the mark
increase citation needed count in situ
redraft
Conclusion pro tempore:
redraft
Concluding commentary:
1.  I should add another [] next to immunoresponse.
2.  Could I add another citation needed mark next to impossible?  This again seems to be making the error, forgiven in the lede but important to avoid in the rest of the paragraph, of presuming brokenness before establishing what the actual issue is.
3.  Redrafting this sentence for improved citation flow may be desirable.

**Citation project iteration 1 concluded**
output state: redraft necessary on paragraph two.

Second draft:
This one's a potential personal challenge.  I've always had trouble accounting for myself, and in this case I've got an unusual narrative in the wrong direction.  Y'see, the pandemic was a pure improvement to my quality of advice.  I'm not about to object to moving out, but I've been living on silver.  I hope I can find tolerance enough to say, there is good news to be found in this global nightmare.

Far from the world of political stresses, humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies!  Presently, this technology of RNA vaccination[] is stalled behind a major barrier, which is that human immune systems learn resistance against currently known RNA vaccines[].  Now we're trying out new prototype RNA vaccination technologies[] in massive scale trials which should cure COVID-19 whether or not they fix the weaknesses with our previous generation of RNA vaccination technologies.  If that self-limiting factor in RNA vaccination does get fixed by the efforts of scientists involved in the current research push, we can do more than just cure COVID-19.  We'll be able to cure a host of pathogenic ailments presently unsuited for vaccine targeting[].  This extends even to some unusually defined pathogens, such as allergens.  With RNA vaccinations, we can even start rolling out allergy vaccinations[] to the public to fix some of the myriad petty quality of life issues which afflict a great many people.

Redraft commentary:
This doesn't fix more than is presently known obligatory to fix, risking the potential necessity of a draft three.  It's still very exciting, and now it arranges the flow of information more coherently.

**Draft citation project iteration 2**
Citation needed:
Presently, this technology of RNA vaccination[]
Initial commentary:
1.  This citation needs to conceptually introduce the technology to the audience.
Suggested sources:

Conclusion pro tempore:
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-are-mrna-vaccines-so-exciting-2020121021599
Concluding commentary:
1.  Correctly structured citations may offer an overlapping information structure creating multiple possible citation sources at many junctures.
2.  I may come back to add more suggested sources at each point, and should remind myself not to feel self-conscious about using the first fit source at many points.  This is already more effort than the assignment requires to complete at full acknowledged result quality.

Citation needed:
is stalled behind a major barrier, which is that human immune systems learn resistance against currently known RNA vaccines[].
Initial commentary:
1.  This seems like information that may become hard to find at future points as people take inventions for granted, so I'm glad to be adding it to my records.
2.  It's possible that I'm severely in error here, yet I would swear I've read about this before.  I understand that necessity was pushed very hard here, yet it seems like information inconvenient to 'necessary' courses of action tends to fall out of visibility to a disproportionate extent...
3.  Persuasion is more competent if it includes evidence of hazards.  This is a general advice whose truth value increases in technical environments such as academia.
4.  I should take some notes about my own understanding here, as well; in searching for further information, I have to refine my mental model to seek after new search targets.  In this case, it appears that the effect which I am searching for (immune system deactivation of RNA vaccines) may be caused by the self-adjuvanting function of RNA vaccines.  Although this function is basically desirable in vaccines, which must stimulate immunoresponse in order to be competent as vaccines, among the behaviors that the immune system stimulates in response to this provocation is the production of Type 1 IFN and other interferons.  By inhibiting RNA transcription, they can prevent the basic function by which the RNA vaccine confers immunity.
5.  It appears that dsRNA pollutants may decrease the efficacy of RNA vaccines by signalling the immune system to produce more RNA transcription inhibitor molecules.  This suggests that current reductions in inappropriate targeting by the immune system of the RNA vaccine compound may be due to increases in the precision with which RNA vaccines are purified.

Citation needed:
 Now we're trying out new prototype RNA vaccination technologies[]
 Initial commentary:
 1.  This is actually kind of uncomfortable.  The RNA vaccines are novel.
 2.  This citation needs to establish the novelty of the vaccines.

Concluding commentary:
To-do

Citation needed:
in massive scale trials[]
Initial commentary:
1.  This is also kind of uncomfortable.  I'm referring to accelerated public deployment of prototype vaccine technologies.  Medical science doesn't like to do these things, but a global recession created by widespread quarantining in response to a pandemic brings a lot of necessity pressure to bear.
2.  This citation needs to establish the acceleration of the work on the vaccine.

Blue sky foolishness:  "While performing the research that went into this essay, I compiled a procedural report describing the steps that physicians would need to perform in order to perform allergen vaccination treatments."
