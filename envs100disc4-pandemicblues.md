# Envs100disc4 PandemicBlues

First draft:
This one's a potential personal challenge.  I've always had trouble accounting for myself, and in this case I've got an unusual narrative in the wrong direction.  Y'see, the pandemic was a pure improvement to my quality of advice.  I'm not about to object to moving out, but I've been living on the silver cloud.

I tell you, there is good news to be found in this global nightmare.  Far from the world of political stresses, humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies[]!  That's the tech to do a bunch of really cool stuff previously impossible for humanity due to self-limiting factors in human immunoresponse to RNA vaccinations[].  Now we're trying out new prototype RNA vaccination technologies[] in massive scale trials which should cure COVID-19 whether or not they fix the weaknesses with our previous generation of RNA vaccination technologies.  If that self-limiting factor in RNA vaccination does get fixed by the efforts of scientists involved in the current research push, we can do more than just cure COVID-19.  We can also start rolling out allergy vaccinations[] to the public to fix a myriad of petty quality of life issues which afflict them.

Allergies risk sounding like a petty focus in this context, but I think it's a very important aspect of humanity's medical potential.  The improved sense of health from curative allergy treatments would be universally available as well as providing a nice little karmic boost for removing allergies as a topic that can divide people in misery.  Freed of the weight of allergens, some of the people who are presently of marginal productivity will become more competent in their lives without need for the application of psychological change pressures[].  People are both happier and more productive when they aren't suffering allergy symptoms[].  Even some of the interpersonal hatred that comes between people can be resolved by interventions like this.  How many people in this world are hated because they are "doing nothing"[]?  Are any of those people unproductive because their life forces them into frequent exposures to allergens[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can make those individuals productive without handing a moral victory to people who were unduly pressuring them.  How often are people harder to tolerate due to a flaw as politely unmentionable and ethically irrelevant as a bad personal odor[]?  Are any of the malodorous people stuck in that state due to undiscovered food allergies[], or allergic responses to nearly-unavoidable foods like grain[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can help those people achieve the social respect they deserve.

Looking forward to changing technology is a little like looking at the bright side of all things.  It is horrible that people suffer of disease, but on the other hand every advance in our biotechnical capabilities can bring forth wonders.  Our society has more to gain in cohesion and beauty within the next few years for that the work being done to cure this plague is being done today.  We are increasing our ability to target the molecular machinery of pathogens, and in that process we are gaining permanent advantage in all contest against disease, which force cannot forever survive against the might of human medical capabilities.  We need only ensure that a sufficient force is brought to bear against it.  Every barrier in this world formed of faulty medical conditions can in time be dissolved should we but have the will to reach for their dissolution.

Whew.  This is going to be hard to author citations for.  I know where to find the research that I'm drawing from, but my citodensity is going to score another high as I try to bring people with technical minds into my excitement.  I'm starting to think I love the university environment.

Conceivably, it might be possible to cite that psychological change pressures make people unhappy.  I think I can probably cite something suggesting the unproductive are disliked.  Substantiating the claim that malorodousness impairs social standing would be straightforward and favorable although it is also fairly obvious, and I'm unsure where to find that information; I should also try to substantiate the technical claim that allergies can increase malodorousness.  The citation about unavoidable foods should be about substantiating a link between grain allergies and malodorousness, not about establishing the existence of grain allergies.

I feel emotionally overwhelmed by this assignment.  "I've always had trouble accounting for myself," is no idle statement.  Trying to describe my life in public school essays was nothing short of traumatic; it was a good way to make me cry an awful lot.

...I slept on it, and I still feel this way.  I'm not sure how to proceed with this draft.  The task of digging up the citations is mechanically straightforward.  If someone else had written this with the same citation gaps, I could easily look them up, fill them in, and consider it good work.  Yet it's my own, and that hurts.  I'm not saying anything I'm unhappy to say.  If I were posting it instantly without citations, I'd have no trouble.

This is important to me, and my default headspace isn't cutting it.  We don't have good personality editing tools available IRL (The-Personality-Scavenge-Service), so I'm going to
