# Envs100disc4 PandemicBlues

First draft:
This one's a potential personal challenge.  I've always had trouble accounting for myself, and in this case I've got an unusual narrative in the wrong direction.  Y'see, the pandemic was a pure improvement to my quality of advice.  I'm not about to object to moving out, but I've been living on the silver cloud.

I tell you, there is good news to be found in this global nightmare.  Far from the world of political stresses, humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies[]!  That's the tech to do a bunch of really cool stuff previously impossible for humanity due to self-limiting factors in human immunoresponse to RNA vaccinations[].  Now we're trying out new prototype RNA vaccination technologies[] in massive scale trials which should cure COVID-19 whether or not they fix the weaknesses with our previous generation of RNA vaccination technologies.  If that self-limiting factor in RNA vaccination does get fixed by the efforts of scientists involved in the current research push, we can do more than just cure COVID-19.  We can also start rolling out allergy vaccinations[] to the public to fix a myriad of petty quality of life issues which afflict them.

Allergies risk sounding like a petty focus in this context, but I think it's a very important aspect of humanity's medical potential.  The improved sense of health from curative allergy treatments would be universally available as well as providing a nice little karmic boost for removing allergies as a topic that can divide people in misery.  Freed of the weight of allergens, some of the people who are presently of marginal productivity will become more competent in their lives without need for the application of psychological change pressures[].  People are both happier and more productive when they aren't suffering allergy symptoms[].  Even some of the interpersonal hatred that comes between people can be resolved by interventions like this.  How many people in this world are hated because they are "doing nothing"[]?  Are any of those people unproductive because their life forces them into frequent exposures to allergens[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can make those individuals productive without handing a moral victory to people who were unduly pressuring them.  How often are people harder to tolerate due to a flaw as politely unmentionable and ethically irrelevant as a bad personal odor[]?  Are any of the malodorous people stuck in that state due to undiscovered food allergies[], or allergic responses to nearly-unavoidable foods like grain[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can help those people achieve the social respect they deserve.

Looking forward to changing technology is a little like looking at the bright side of all things.  It is horrible that people suffer of disease, but on the other hand every advance in our biotechnical capabilities can bring forth wonders.  Our society has more to gain in cohesion and beauty within the next few years for that the work being done to cure this plague is being done today.  We are increasing our ability to target the molecular machinery of pathogens, and in that process we are gaining permanent advantage in all contest against disease, which force cannot forever survive against the might of human medical capabilities.  We need only ensure that a sufficient force is brought to bear against it.  Every barrier in this world formed of faulty medical conditions can in time be dissolved should we but have the will to reach for their dissolution.

Whew.  This is going to be hard to author citations for.  I know where to find the research that I'm drawing from, but my citodensity is going to score another high as I try to bring people with technical minds into my excitement.  I'm starting to think I love the university environment.

Conceivably, it might be possible to cite that psychological change pressures make people unhappy.  I think I can probably cite something suggesting the unproductive are disliked.  Substantiating the claim that malorodousness impairs social standing would be straightforward and favorable although it is also fairly obvious, and I'm unsure where to find that information; I should also try to substantiate the technical claim that allergies can increase malodorousness.  The citation about unavoidable foods should be about substantiating a link between grain allergies and malodorousness, not about establishing the existence of grain allergies.

---
I feel emotionally overwhelmed by this assignment.  "I've always had trouble accounting for myself," is no idle statement.  Trying to describe my life in public school essays was nothing short of traumatic; it was a good way to make me cry an awful lot.
---

...I slept on it, and I still feel this way.  I'm not sure how to proceed with this draft.  The task of digging up the citations is mechanically straightforward.  If someone else had written this with the same citation gaps, I could easily look them up, fill them in, and consider it good work.  Yet it's my own, and that hurts.  I'm not saying anything I'm unhappy to say.  If I were posting it instantly without citations, I'd have no trouble.
---

This is important to me, and my default headspace isn't brandishing a diamond saw.  We don't have good personality editing tools available IRL (this reminds me of a story I wrote, [[The-Personality-Scavenge-Service]]), so I've been using cannabis instead.  It's a chaotic influence, but it's the only immediately available tool.  It does seem to be helping.  I've been at least holding at this task and I certainly feel like I'm developing a better response to it as I continue to record my thought processes ranging the vicinity.  The citation-lookup step has been very pleasant in my coursework generally, and it focuses on a task which I consider especially desirable both presently and historically in my life.  Here I have written an essay speaking of joy, and every citation it points towards is a citation for the possibility of a brighter future.  This is the silver lining and why the problem is getting better!  This is the good news!
---

Would it feel better if I redrafted it impersonally?  I think it would be incomprehensible.  It would go from impactful to barely relevant, *while* losing emotional coherency.   The good post here admits to pain, even if it's harder to write.
---

...maybe I need to take more steps to decompose the material.  If I take every citable claim and individually copy it into my notes below in this section, can I address them in a better way by removing them from the contextual weight of their paragraph?  Let's try it.

**Draft citation project iteration 1**
Citation needed:
humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies[]!
Initial Commentary:
1.  I think I increased the emotional weight of this task on myself by putting myself in a position of having to cite an exclamation point.  I understand it as a rhetorical decision, but I'm putting this down as a note to myself to be mindful of the increase in emotional challenge of authorship.
2.  The difficulty here is in the sub-claims, as established by the word 'fixing'.  For something to be fixed, it has to be broken.  Since I'm not even presuming my audience is familiar with RNA vaccines, I now have to establish both that the technology exists and that it is currently in need of fixing.
3.  Noting the existence of sub-claims clarifies that this sentence is a lede, and may be better uncited.  The paragraph establishes the lede of the paragraph, and the other citations can be for the purpose of the lede.
4.  The actual first sentence of the paragraph is an emotional tone-setting, and might be better off in the first paragraph where it is on topic rather than the second where it is not.

Conclusion pro tempore:

Concluding commentary:
1.  I don't need to cite the lede.
2.  I do need to make sure the rest of the citations in the paragraph establish everything that the lede requires to be true.

Citation needed:
That's the tech to do a bunch of really cool stuff previously impossible for humanity due to self-limiting factors in human immunoresponse to RNA vaccinations[].
Initial Commentary:
1.  I need to establish that self-limiting factors in human immunoresponse exist.
2.  I haven't established yet what RNA vaccinations are.
3.  This citation point is trying to do too much and needs to be rethought.
Suggested sources:
split the mark
increase citation needed count in situ
redraft
Conclusion pro tempore:
redraft
Concluding commentary:
1.  I should add another [] next to immunoresponse.
2.  Could I add another citation needed mark next to impossible?  This again seems to be making the error, forgiven in the lede but important to avoid in the rest of the paragraph, of presuming brokenness before establishing what the actual issue is.
3.  Redrafting this sentence for improved citation flow may be desirable.

**Citation project iteration 1 concluded**
output state: redraft necessary on paragraph two.

Second draft:
This one's a potential personal challenge.  I've always had trouble accounting for myself, and in this case I've got an unusual narrative in the wrong direction.  Y'see, the pandemic was a pure improvement to my quality of advice.  I'm not about to object to moving out, but I've been living on silver.  I hope I can find tolerance enough to say, there is good news to be found in this global nightmare.

Far from the world of political stresses, humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA Vaccination technologies!  Presently, this technology of RNA vaccination[] is stalled behind a major barrier, which is that human immune systems learn resistance against currently known RNA vaccines[].

If that self-limiting factor in RNA vaccination does get fixed by the efforts of scientists involved in the current research push, we can do more than just cure COVID-19.  We'll be able to cure a host of pathogenic ailments presently unsuited for vaccine targeting[].  This extends even to some unusually defined pathogens, such as allergens.  With RNA vaccinations, we can even start rolling out allergy vaccinations[] to the public to fix some of the myriad petty quality of life issues which afflict a great many people.

Redraft commentary:
This doesn't fix more than is presently known obligatory to fix, risking the potential necessity of a draft three.  It's still very exciting, and now it arranges the flow of information more coherently.

Concluding commentary:
1.  Correctly structured citations may offer an overlapping information structure creating multiple possible citation sources at many junctures.
2.  I may come back to add more suggested sources at each point, and should remind myself not to feel self-conscious about using the first fit source at many points.  This is already more effort than the assignment requires to complete at full acknowledged result quality.

is stalled behind a major barrier, which is that human immune systems learn resistance against currently known RNA vaccines[].
Initial commentary:
1.  This seems like information that may become hard to find at future points as people take inventions for granted, so I'm glad to be adding it to my records.
2.  It's possible that I'm severely in error here, yet I would swear I've read about this before.  I understand that necessity was pushed very hard here, yet it seems like information inconvenient to 'necessary' courses of action tends to fall out of visibility to a disproportionate extent...
3.  Persuasion is more competent if it includes evidence of hazards.  This is a general advice whose truth value increases in technical environments such as academia.
4.  I should take some notes about my own understanding here, as well; in searching for further information, I have to refine my mental model to seek after new search targets.  In this case, it appears that the effect which I am searching for (immune system deactivation of RNA vaccines) may be caused by the self-adjuvanting function of RNA vaccines.  Although this function is basically desirable in vaccines, which must stimulate immunoresponse in order to be competent as vaccines, among the behaviors that the immune system stimulates in response to this provocation is the production of Type 1 IFN and other interferons.  By inhibiting RNA transcription, they can prevent the basic function by which the RNA vaccine confers immunity.
5.  It appears that dsRNA pollutants may decrease the efficacy of RNA vaccines by signalling the immune system to produce more RNA transcription inhibitor molecules.  This suggests that current reductions in inappropriate targeting by the immune system of the RNA vaccine compound may be due to increases in the precision with which RNA vaccines are purified.
6.  There is some trait 'Cap0', 'Cap1', or 'uncapped' which may apply to RNA or not.  Whether 'capped' or 'uncapped', free RNA in cells is targeted for immunoresponse.  RNA with Cap1 caps are still translated after being targeted for immunoresponse, whereas Cap0 and uncapped RNA are not.  Thus, efficacy in RNA vaccines could be increased by using Cap1-capped RNA molecules.
7.  The materials that I'm currently reading claim that the real problem interfering with RNA vaccination was intracellular delivery.  Hm...  I wonder if this is going to end up inciting a redraft.  I'm going to update my conclusion pro tempore.  I hate to give up on something obscure that I recall which would be very rhetorically useful if I could find it again in the research, but I'd rather have technical accuracy as verifiable rather than publishing something bizarrely impossible to substantiate.

1.  I added this line to compensate for the risk of seeming trivial created by my focus on allergens.  I do think that in terms of, shall we say 'public aura', that allergies are among the highest priority cure targets.  Fixing allergens will do more to make people love each other than fixing influenza.  Yet fixing influenza has more gravitas.

1.  This is what I'm working for!  This potential can make people love each other more.  It gets rid of something that divides people, something that people resent about each other, one of the unmentionable hidden psychic injuries in humanity...  Allergies are just sniffling misery in the sinuses and malodorous misery in the gut.

Concluding commentary:
1.  From source 30063806, "The subtle priming of T helper 1 immunity induced by this vaccine type closely resembles responses of non-allergic individuals and-by boosting via natural allergen exposure-could suffice for long-term protection from type I allergy."  This is such a good line.  Likewise from 20856111, "Preliminary data raise the question whether TH1 immune deviation induced by mRNA vaccination resembles the natural phenotype of a certain proportion of nonatopic individuals."
2.  I'm still looking for the downside information that I thought I recalled!

Blue sky foolishness:  "While performing the research that went into this essay, I compiled a procedural report describing the steps that physicians would need to perform in order to perform allergen vaccination treatments."

I'm not actually intending to do this, but I think I could do it if I were asked to.

---
I'm too caught up in this work.  Seriously redrafting to eliminate the unsupported claim may require a fresh mindset.  I have a math lecture in an hour - they're soul-killing, because I have to watch the class struggle with the concepts - and I'm going to refresh my thoughts by playing [[The-Viceroy]] for an hour.

---
Coming back to this task.  It's due tomorrow, and it's not the only thing due tomorrow.  God, do I actually redraft again?  I feel like I'm doing a disservice to medical research if I can't reconstruct a potential causality of immunoresistance from RNA vaccines.  Among currently pending assignments, this isn't the most important work for my grades, but it's the most important work to ME.

Foreign RNA in a cell is a threat to the genomic stability of that cell.  It makes sense that cells would have some countermeasure to this.  If the countermeasure 'learns', as most immunoresponse processes DO, then the resistance causality is restored.  If the resistance causality is something real and obscure, anything I can do to surface it may have real consequences, no matter how trivial the edgecase in which I'm publishing the material.  I've learned not to denigrate small research tasks...  I originally found information about this particular drawback of RNA vaccines while researching allergy vaccines, where I found it used as the reason for "why we aren't already doing this in humans".

It helps that I love the material.  Is there a difference between mRNA and miRNA?  I don't know, but as I keep reading these research papers, I'm very likely to figure it out.

The immune system isn't that competent against RNA viruses, but it's not helpless.  People who suffer a hundred colds in a lifetime defeat more than 99 of them on average.  Not every RNA virus is the natively ineradicable HIV.  At the same time, HIV shows that finding some way to evade inappropriate immune recognition is possible, and that may also be desirable for some purposes.  Not the purpose of HIV itself, but for other uses of RNA.  So I feel like there's potential to better define immunoresponse to RNA-based stimuli, and if I could find the material it would help me make my case in this essay.

I've found references to TLRs (Toll-Like Receptors) and PRRs (Pattern Recognition Receptors) as potential intermediaries of cellular interface with potential foreign RNA.  No info yet on learning behaviors, nor research directly linking this to the construction of RNA vaccines.  The cGAS-STING signalling axis deals with recognition of foreign DNA and also serves an intracellular immune role supportive of genomic stability, but that shouldn't be relevant; RNA isn't DNA.  If I can figure out how PRRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), maybe I can figure out why RNA vaccines evade PRRs.

I've found some research that suggests actively provoking the immune system's intracellular pathogen response systems in order to create local competency against infections which natively evade or underactivate cellular countermeasures, and I've found plenty that talks about the self-adjuvanting properties of RNA vaccines, but I haven't found mention of adverse immune system learning.

More jargon for potential recognizers:  Some PRRs recognize RNA viral infections including toll-like receptors 3 and 8 (TLRs), NOD-like receptors NLRP6 and 9 (NLRs), certain DDX/DHX helicases, and RLRs (retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5).  Copied from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019452/

It looks like this really digs hard into the biochemical dynamics of the system at its smallest scale.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  The microRNA molecules are only about 22 nucleotides, and if I understand the concept correctly, a nucleotide is only about 22 atoms in size.  22^2 is not a large molecule in biochemical terms.  How can interface structures attaching to target objects that are only 484 molecules wide 'learn' and gain pattern recognition features?  It sounds like quite an information density challenge.

PRRs sense "nucleic acid motifs", according to: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302314/

Yet how do they sensitize?  How do we avoid sensitizing them to our vaccine compounds?

Goofy thought preserved for bio-weirdness reasons:  Can we program cellular machinery that emulates the DNA transcription targets of viruses with shim consequences, inducing viral DNA transcription without functional impact?  New designer immune system tool if so...

Weird narrative thought though, something like that could be used to selectively interfere with a gene-editing system.  Maybe any gene editing system.  Resistance to gene editing... is something that cells already try to have, and it is itself a variable that we can try to increase or erode.

I wonder what the intracellular reaction rate of a ring-shaped molecule whose inner surface held the reaction surface would be.  Thinking about the smallness of RNA molecules and wondering about how to 'learn' patterns in them with an interface molecule made me wonder if a ring-shaped structure would be able to create a dense network of interaction potentials where small changes would substantially alter its response profile.  This is a terribly fuzzy visualization though, and I'm no good at puzzle games.  I don't understand puzzle solution algorithms, and packing 'learning' into a maximally dense package sounds like a puzzle solution algorithm to me.  It's also a thought that probably has nothing to do with what I'm trying to accomplish here.

I wish I could cite a blog comment!  I found someone making a point about the acceleration of the vaccination research.  Content below reproduced on 1/27/2021 from: https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/01/11/rna-vaccines-and-their-lipids

Marko,
Excellent summary above, and as far as the follow-up safety testing you’ve hit the nail on the head with this conclusion in particular (again couldn’t reply directly above due to comment nesting):
“The question then becomes how much – 20% , 1% , .01% ? – escapes into the systemic circulation. I believe the number of RNA payloads per dose is on the order several billion, so some unknown fraction of that constitutes the number of potential off-target cells”

That’s exactly it — couldn’t have said it better. For the longitudinal follow-up in the clinical trials and broader population, it’d be helpful to have a more quantitative handle on the non-local distribution of those lipid nanoparticles distant from the injection site. I agree it wouldn’t be a huge concern if there’s just (relatively) random dispersal of injected LNPs systemically, and a nontrivial amount of hepatorenal clearance with each pass — that’s the ideal scenario. Where things get iffy are three-fold:
1. Because of the anatomy and circulatory trajectory from the deltoid and cephalic vein (essentially a straight shot into the SVC), if enough “spillover LNPs” are getting shuttled into the right atrium and transiting through the pulmonary circulation — which could be high, another reference here for the rich vasculature around IM injection — then one of their earliest stops on the map after exiting the heart would be in tissues serviced by branches of the common carotid and subclavian arteries (including the CNS), enhancing delivery to tissues behind the blood-brain barrier simply due to higher relative concentration at tissue corridors more proximal to the injection site.
2. Even if initial transit through the BBB and into other sensitive tissue parenchyma is relatively low, there’d be a cumulative effect with each booster delivering more spillover LNPs to those non-local sites.
3. Related to that point, the duration of immunity is still unclear, and there seems to be general agreement that while COVID-19 symptoms are reduced with the immunization, viral spread is not. If antibody and memory B/T-cell levels wane within a few months after vaccination, then we’d be looking at repeated boosters possibly multiple times a year given ongoing community dissemination. And since the development of many e.g. CNS disorders is gradual — with subclinical issues taking shape over years before clinical manifestations become apparent (as seen in MS and ALS) — such cumulative damage likely wouldn’t raise red flags at first, but could increase in likelihood with successive boosters.

Plus there are the potential issues raised by the paper that S dug up, such that even small levels of BBB traversal by the LNPs could engender spike protein uptake by e.g. oligodendrocytes and neurons beyond the number of LNPs themselves, due to that adsorptive transcytosis of S proteins into bystander glial and neural cells. The LNPs really are an intriguing and promising technology and it’ll be wonderful if this modality turns out to work. But simply because the clinical trial process is being accelerated so fast beyond the normal decade-long timeline for vaccine development, it just seems prudent to dot every i and cross every t when it comes to the follow-up and knowledge of the LNPs’ tissue localization, even more so given all the unknowns about the proprietary LNP formulations. In addition to animal studies with reporter genes, might be helpful to have data from more extensive imaging studies in patient cohorts, especially things like T1 and T2-weighted MRI to assess (mainly) CNS myelination and the white matter milieu in general over varying temporal intervals (3 months, 6 months, one year and so on) after receiving the injections.

I've found another source relating RNA vaccination potentials to retraining the immune system, with the potential to detrain overactive inflammatory responses.  That's here: nature.com/articles/d41573-021-00014-w

If I'm understanding correctly something that I'm currently reading, RNA vaccines are delivered in replicons which are like little psuedovirus particles that only express bits of the virus we want the immune system to see.  This seems like it has to be the wrong understanding somehow...  The injected RNA instructs cells to produce these replicons, and then the immune system starts learning how to fight them.  When it is competent against the replicons, it is competent against viruses bearing the parts that the replicons showed them how to fight.  The problem I'm concerned with is, does this lead to permanent inflammation from producing cells for the immune system to use as a shooting gallery?  How many replicons are created, and for how long?  This information is being disappointingly hard to find.

I'm trying to figure out how heavily the RNA vaccination process can be safely used.  If it's really such an excellent, diversely applicable tool opening so many new potentials, can we use it to its extreme or would something go wrong?  Is there a stronger rate-limiter involved than the public's resistance to being stabbed with needles?  I think vaccines struggle with an excess of positivity; they don't seem to have downsides, and rhetorically that's difficult to work with.  In most human endeavors, the perfect all-positive stuff is just false and exploitative.

I keep wondering if there's some downside to causing cells to produce a bunch of replicons.  When they cram the intercellular space with little psuedoviral particles, are they bringing down some future chaos on the person in whose body this process is proceeding?  Will cells intended to learn PAMPs learn bad patterns which are adjacent to the replicon patterns?  Will they decide the wrong bit of the psuedoviral particles are pathogenic and start attacking very wrong tissues?

How does this stuff work?  How do I make myself feel comfortable writing pure boosterism?  I know I did talk about living on the silver lining, but...  I don't like putting forward a pure silver perspective.  I don't think I have any other option, though I worry that there should be more negative information than has been made available.  I wonder if that is possibly itself the basic general disbelief which impairs biological transformation research... or, to confess an esoteric thought, I wonder if I drifted from one universe (where RNA vaccines are a self-limiting technology that scientists are struggling to make work) to another universe (where RNA vaccines are a reliable technology which has merely been held back due to concerns about potential unknown long-term side effects).  I'm not at all interested in holding back medical interventions for potential unknown long-term side effects.  I want to shapeshift!  I want to replace EVERYTHING in my body.  I'm not afraid of a few years miserable in the wrong morph.  Been there, done that, story of my LIFE.  The technological arc that could put me through that is the same arc that could put me out of being in that state NOW.

...anyways.  I have to follow where the available data points, and that means I have to write a happier draft three.  Dang this reality, pushing me to be optimistic.

I am kind of concerned that if we teach the cells of the body to make a whole bunch of replicon lipid vesicles, we may end up overfeeding the macrophage population.  Are we going to give people incurable hypermacrophagia if they take too many RNA vaccinations?  What happens to people who have that problem?

Third draft:
This essay has been a personal challenge to write.  I've always had trouble accounting for myself, and in this case I've got an unusual narrative in the wrong direction.  Y'see, the pandemic was a pure improvement to my quality of advice.  I'm not about to object to moving out, but I've been living on silver.  I hope I can find tolerance enough to say that there is good news to be found in this global nightmare.

Far from the world of political stresses, humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA vaccination technologies[].  While studying the available research in order to write this essay, I wasn't able to discern why this technology wasn't deployed more swiftly and for a wider variety of applications, because RNA vaccination appears to be wholly advantageous and much more diversely applicable than modern DNA vaccination technology.  RNA vaccines give to cells instructions[] which they utilize to produce noninfectious psuedoviral particles known as replicons[].  Each replicon is a tiny lipid vesicle which expresses basic viral replication abilities plus a harm-reduced subset of viral features that we want the immune system to learn from.  COVID-19 replicons prominently express the infamous spike protein[] that COVID-19 uses to enter cells.  It is a distinctive feature not found in tissues we want to preserve which is highly conserved across strains of COVID-19[], and immune cells which react aggressively to it are expected to be highly effective against COVID-19 viral particles[].  Where the COVID-19 viral particles have a lot of viral machinery with which to attack the body and spread themselves, my understanding is that COVID-19 vax-replicons are basically little lipid blobs with intrusion spikes on them that won't damage the body enough to stop the immune system from learning how to attack that spike.

This technique of teaching cells to make noninfectious lipid blobs that express pathogen associated chemistries that we want to train the immune system against is applicable to far more than just COVID-19, and indeed to more pathogens than medicine currently has effective countermeasures against.  RNA vaccines let us customize the immunoresponse pattern by choosing which pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) we teach the body to present to the immune system, which allows for vaccines to be deployed targeting specific highly conserved components of difficult-to-target viruses, thereby producing more general (less strain-specific) vaccinations which viruses will be less capable of mutating to evade.  There is interest in using this technique to produce new, more general vaccines for influenza[], and some researchers believe RNA vaccination will make an HIV vaccine[] possible as well.  Yet the possibility that most excites me is something of a trivial edge-case which previous vaccine technologies could never accomplish: allergy vaccines[].

Allergies risk sounding like a petty focus in this context, but I think it's a very important aspect of humanity's medical potential.  The improved sense of health from curative allergy treatments would be universally available as well as providing a nice little karmic boost for removing allergies as a topic that can divide people in misery.  Freed of the weight of allergens, some of the people who are presently of marginal productivity will become more competent in their lives without need for the application of psychological change pressures.  People are both happier and more productive when they aren't suffering allergy symptoms[].  Even some of the interpersonal hatred that comes between people can be resolved by interventions like this.  How many people in this world are hated because they are "doing nothing"[]?  Are any of those people unproductive because their life forces them into frequent exposures to allergens[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can make those individuals productive without handing a moral victory to people who were unduly pressuring them.  How often are people harder to tolerate due to a flaw as politely unmentionable and ethically irrelevant as a bad personal odor[]?  Are any of the malodorous people stuck in that state due to undiscovered food allergies[], or allergic responses to nearly-unavoidable foods like grain[]?  A medical system that can fix allergies can help those people achieve the social respect they deserve.

Looking forward to changing technology is a little like looking at the bright side of all things, and thanks to my interest in biotechnology, I can't say I've been suffering terribly under pandemic blues.  It is horrible that people suffer of disease, but on the other hand every advance in our biotechnical capabilities can bring forth wonders.  Our society has more to gain in cohesion and beauty within the next few years for that the work being done to cure this plague is being done today.  We are increasing our ability to target the molecular machinery of pathogens, and in that process we are gaining permanent advantage in all contest against disease, which force cannot forever survive against the might of human medical capabilities.  We need only ensure that a sufficient force is brought to bear against it.  Every barrier in this world formed of faulty medical conditions can in time be dissolved should we but have the will to reach for their dissolution.

New draft complete.  This should be the final draft, but I still need to complete the citations.

**Draft citation project iteration 3**

Citation needed:
humanity's brightest minds have been hard at work fixing up RNA vaccination technologies[]
Initial commentary:
1.  This is still a lede, but now 'fixing' has been reduced to a genericism, and citing the lede is feasible.
2.  This citation needs to conceptually introduce the technology to the audience.

Conclusion pro tempore:
https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/why-are-mrna-vaccines-so-exciting-2020121021599
Concluding commentary:
1.  Correctly structured citations may offer an overlapping information structure creating multiple possible citation sources at many junctures.
2.  I may come back to add more suggested sources at each point, and should remind myself not to feel self-conscious about using the first fit source at many points.  This is already more effort than the assignment requires to complete at full acknowledged result quality.

Citation needed:
RNA vaccines give to cells instructions[]
Initial commentary:
1.  This needs to establish the RNA transcription process.
Suggested sources:

Conclusion pro tempore:
https://rk.md/2020/how-mrna-vaccines-work-gene-transcription-and-translation/
Concluding commentary:
1.  I'm trying to work quickly, because I have multiple assignments due today.  Today's math homework is worth a deceptively small 5 points, but the course has a very small number of points.

Citation needed:
noninfectious psuedoviral particles known as replicons[]
Initial commentary:
1.  This needs to establish what replicons are.  I had to dig for this and I'm not totally sure of my own understanding, so I want it linked.
2.  I've immediately found a source with an excellent explanation, but a non-indicative title...
Suggested sources:
https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-10-64#:~:text=A%20viral%20replicon%20is%20a,or%20replaced%20by%20foreign%20genes (Non indicative title?)

Concluding commentary:
1.  If I include the string at the end so that it provides the jump and highlight behavior, it should still work to use this source.

Citation needed:
COVID-19 replicons prominently express the infamous spike protein[]
Initial commentary:
1.  I really wish I'd built up a better understanding of how viral replicons work, though I do believe I've learned enough to complete this assignment.  Uncertainties and errors left in at this juncture are dreadfully sincere.
2.  I'm not sure that the COVID-19 replicons being used for vaccination actually express the spike protein.  There's definitely a ton of research being done on them...
Suggested sources:

Conclusion pro tempore:
https://www.asbmb.org/asbmb-today/science/122020/covid-19-vaccines-focus-on-the-spike-protein-but-t
Concluding commentary:
1.  If I had more days to spend on this or less other work I need to be doing, I wouldn't really be satisfied with this source, but...
2.  It says what I need it to say with the semblance of medical authority behind it.  >_>
3.  This is an important lesson in how bad information spreads sometimes, but hopefully in this case I'm lucky enough to get good information with a bad method.

Citation needed:
which is highly conserved across strains of COVID-19[]
Initial commentary:
1.  I don't strictly need to cite that the spike protein is highly conserved across strains of COVID-19, but I think it's good practice.
Suggested sources:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19439480/
Conclusion pro tempore:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19439480/
Concluding commentary:
1.  Actually, this source asserts that the spike protein is highly conserved across all coronaviridae, which is a stronger and more interesting claim.  Does that mean that antibodies to the spike protein produced by covid-19 vaccination will also incidentally improve vaccine recipients immunocompetency across all coronaviridae through promoting the formation of spike protein antibodies?
2.  This source is a little hard to read.  It's less than ideal.  I feel like I'm going to be thought to have keyed vapidly on the phrase "highly conserved domain" in the title... which is technically true, because that's exactly how I found it, though I did verify that the material also asserts the salient conservation.

Citation needed:
immune cells which react aggressively to it are expected to be highly effective against COVID-19 viral particles[]
Initial commentary:
1.  I wonder if overfixation on the spike protein is going to have some kind of downside.  I know membrane proteins are stereotypically mutagenic, but is there any random bit of the membrane that has a local chaos-resistant nexus?  Some incidentally patterned bit that has trouble mutating to new forms?  For all my complaints about present vaccines being presented in too univalently positive a fashion, I I feel like future vaccines are going to be even better, because they're going to benefit from greater quantities and qualities of low-level biochemical simulation in finding target sites.
2.  Ah, more on topic, this citation is a little uncomfortable, because I believe I could also dig up complaints others have made about overfixation on the spike protein.  I don't think every researcher believes it will be a productive endeavor, and I'm uncomfortably hoping that some very good and virtuous people are wrong in their beliefs about causality, because if they're right this vaccine rollout is only going to kick the pandemic into the next phase of action.  Which won't necessarily be any worse than the present phase, just...  Well, ironically, the potential for failure is beyond the scope of this essay.

Conclusion pro tempore:

Concluding commentary:
1.  I wonder if there's a career in writing this kind of stuff.  I think I'm doing it better than most people would, and I'm not at my limit; with more time and better objectives, I could produce higher quality output than this.

Citation needed:
There is interest in using this technique to produce new, more general vaccines for influenza[]
Initial commentary:
1.  The better the research, the better the citation.  Still, I only have to establish interest, so even a low quality citation suffices here.
Suggested sources:
https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines
Conclusion pro tempore:
https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines
Concluding commentary:
1.  This is a PDF... and it has a grammatical error on page 13.
2.  I'm grateful for my fast reading speed.
3.  This is actually a pretty good source!  I think I can twice-link it to establish interest in an HIV RNA vaccine as well, since it mentions that research possibility on page 15, where it also discusses focusing on highly conserved regions of influenza in order to provide pan-influenza immunity.
4.  I'm really excited by reductions in disease rates.  Societies have historically grown more liberal and tolerant of one other as they've conquered disease risks AFAIK.  I think some of humanity's historic xenophobia was because traders in primitive societies were such horrific disease vectors that societies which heeded crazy hostile people initially prospered ahead of those who tried to work with each other across wide geographic distances.  One of the early human cultures was especially peaceful and cooperative, and well positioned to really get ahead of the curve... until a plague spreading along the tool-and-pottery trade routes totally wiped it out.  Yuck.  The survivors in the region were all from isolated hateful communities that had violently rejected merchants and interacted with the trade routes only by occasionally predating on them, so guess what human society was like in that region for thousands of years afterwards?  Modern societies are already clean enough to ensure that will never happen again, and RNA vaccines are an advance towards eliminating even the medical barriers that remain.
5.  This source also affirms the coronavirus spike protein focus, and could theoretically have been used there as well.
6.  The possibility of using RNA vaccines against bacterial pathogens is mentioned, but I would interpret this material as mentioning it as something which has been under-explored.

Citation needed:
some researchers believe RNA vaccination will make an HIV vaccine[]
Initial commentary:
1.  This is clearly best answered by citing the same thing I just cited for influenza.  A general review document was a great find here.  I can just put the same citation number on both claims.
Suggested sources:
https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines
Conclusion pro tempore:
https://www.phgfoundation.org/briefing/rna-vaccines
Concluding commentary:
1.  Easy!

Citation needed:
Yet the possibility that most excites me is something of a trivial edge-case which previous vaccine technologies could never accomplish: allergy vaccines[]
Initial commentary:
1.  I only have to establish interest in the concept for this... but it's still kind of hard to choose which source I think is most important.
2.  I want to indicate something other than child-focused or prophylactic interest.  I think that forever focusing on children misses out on the pacifism-promoting advantages of vaccinations, which are even the best in terms of their implications on child welfare...  Children are much better treated in those tolerant, cooperative merchant cultures than they are in the xenophobic, exploitative bandit cultures, and the ratio between the two shifts based on adult healthcare, not based on child healthcare.  Actually, I'm kind of frustrated long-term by how many human social processes get a bit deranged when they fixate too exactly on children.  Child welfare is not always best served by child welfare advocates, many of whom are just natalists and prey to natalistic biases.
Suggested sources:
https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/4628660?javascript_support=no
Conclusion pro tempore:
https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/4628660?javascript_support=no
Concluding commentary:
1.  I'm leaving in the "javascript_support=no" line.  It amuses me to do so.
2.  This is a mouse medicine review, but it does everything this point needs.  It talks about mRNA vaccines in a context that takes them implicitly seriously and straightforwardly applies them in experimental procedure.  The data here could be trash and this report would still do what I needed it to do as long as someone was actually out there injecting those poor defenseless meese with biological substances... which is kind of strange to say for more than just the odd verbiage I gave it.  An evaluation like that makes me feel like a less mathematical class of scientist, and how is that even possible?  I can strip my necessity back to establishing that the technology is believed to exist by people who can be expected to only believe in it if it's true.  That necessity is met by the existence of the report and its author's performance of its described operations, even if the entire quantitative content of the report is invalid.  Does logic exist separately from mathematics?

Citation needed:
People are both happier and more productive when they aren't suffering allergy symptoms[]
Initial commentary:
1.  Sweet finally, I am in the next section of citations.  New work with new challenges!
2.  This is productivity data.  Citing both claims would be nice, but citing the productive data is more important.  I think the fact that people are happier when they aren't suffering allergy symptoms is sufficiently subjectively uncontroversial that there's no need of a citation there.

Concluding commentary:
