A time travel movie?  It's been a while since I viewed one of those.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the premise.  It's immediately peculiar that a major character is named Nazuna, since that name brings to mind Nazuna from Brand New Animal, the beautiful fox-woman.

This was an interesting movie, but it left a great many open questions.
