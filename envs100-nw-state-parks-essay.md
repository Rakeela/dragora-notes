# ENVS100 NW State Parks Essay

(Copied from ENVS&100 to-do list)
 - Write a two page paper on one of the State or Federal parks in Washington State.  (Due Feb 3)
   - Describe the diversity of organisms, the natural resources, and the ecosystem services it provides.
   - Describe what if any economic benefit the park provides.
   - Double spaced, 1 inch margins, at most 12 point font.
   - Bibliography on page three, APA format.

I need to provide a summary catalogue of flora and fauna in the chosen park, as well as show my grasp of the concept of ecosystem services through applying the concept to evaluating a real world ecosystem.  That is the task as I understand it.  However, I'm unclear as to what natural resources state parks can provide.

To what extent are they still worked for resources?  Does natural resources have a salient meaning other than referring to resource extraction processes?  Does the task require me to write about what natural resources are being foregone by society in keeping the park pristine?  Does this relate to the conservation function of parks through providing real examples of natural environments as they would be, with the resources that they would have, if humanity did not exhaust the landscape for resources?  Which is to say, is a state park also a museum of natural resources?

Finding uncertainty in the task description like this is uncomfortable, though as I am starting this in the middle of a sleepless night, it will be some hours before I can reasonably question the teacher.  Answering this could be important for determining the economic benefit of the park, as well.

I think the block of questions that I wrote is very remarkable as a well of essay potential.  If I push through with the potential misunderstanding of the state park system as a free-growing museum of natural resources that we need only protect, I suspect I could put together something *very* charismatic.  Who would tell me such a concept was wrong?  I would be praising the beauty of the very stones in those places!

I'm still uncertain.  I put a search for Natural Resources across the internet, and found the Washington State Parks page on Natural Resources, found here:  https://parks.state.wa.us/358/Natural-Resources

"The Natural Resources Program's primary goal is to restore and protect the agency's natural resources, while providing safe and aesthetic environments in which the public can recreate. Current efforts include addressing sensitive species conservation, forest health conditions, controlling invasive species, and collecting resource inventories while supporting applied research and strategic planning. To advance this work, natural resource scientists and managers work directly with park staff, sister agencies, non-profit conservation organizations, and volunteers."

This doesn't answer my uncertainty.  Are sensitive species considered natural resources?  Is forest health a natural resource?  Are invasive species nega-resources?  What goes into a resource inventory?  What do natural resource scientists research?  I have more questions now, but I also have more search direction.  As well, the page discusses salmon recovery efforts quite prominently, and this suggests that salmon and everything salmon require may be considered as natural resources.

I'm actually really unimpressed with the amount of insight this page offers into what the Washington State Parks National Resources Program is actually doing.  What's the program for?  What's a resource inventory?  This could be so much more informative in a public services sense.  Surely I'm not to believe that salmon are the only resource in the national parks.

Searching for "natural resource scientists" lead me to this:  http://www.resourcescientists.com/

This was the top hit.  They're water specialists.  This talks about "resource management and restoration plans", "biological resource projects", "habitat restoration measures involving large-scale monitoring projects", and "natural resource mitigation and enhancement programs".  Client states are listed as California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Nevada, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, and "along the gulf of Mexico".  I'm still a little unclear what natural resources are in context, but this looks very proximate to salmon.  They're really focused on waterways.  Is the WSP National Resources Program all about fish?

I also found something interesting at the Department of the Interior website, here:  https://www.doi.gov/careers/occupational-series/natural-resources-management-and-biological-sciences

"Natural resource specialists study sensitive habitats, develop natural resources regulations and guidance, help protect lives, property, and resources from fires, inventory and monitor wildlife or vegetation, analyze and mitigate environmental impacts, and restore and protect threatened animals and plants. The duties performed by DOI natural resource specialists vary greatly by location, bureau, and position."

This is about natural resource specialists, not natural resource scientists.  Still, it's getting closer to telling me what natural resources are.  I'm getting the impression that "natural resources" in the environmental context amounts to "anything conceivably valuable in nature".  It's all the stuff humanity wants to protect in wilderness areas.  Maybe I can still throw a sentence in about geology, but it doesn't look like preserving stones for the future is very high on the agenda.

This is kind of fascinating.  "What if any" was how the teacher presented the subject matter's economic importance as well.  I get the sense that I'm supposed to scavenge for a belief in economic gains here, but I'm not sure they're here to be found.  I see a lot of unclear language.  Despite this, I do believe very strongly in environmental protection as a pillar of long-term economic advantage.  I believe in ecosystem services.  I see this concern as being of a kind with, though differing in scale from, my thoughts on geo-engineering.

I don't want to be doing this.  I only care about environmentalism because I'm obligated to.  I'd still plate the wilderness with metal to control conditions in it if I could.  I'd fill space with mirrors and cover the ocean with them, all to make sure infrared radiation was going where civilization wanted it.  I don't... care about the natural world.  I care only grudgingly about wild animals, whose existence I see as so bleak and horrific that it hurts to think about them.  If we could just reduce it all to computronium and reimplement it in simulation, we could implement it without suffering.  No sentience should need to suffer.

This universe is just so cosmically ugly, and I'm not referring to how it /looks/.  It /looks/ beautiful.  I wish it actually were.

I wish we could launch a solar shade made of solar panels with orbital installations turning the energy thus captured into hydrogen fuel for the space economy.

This feels like writing porn for online "friends" did.  Like something appalling that I'm obligated to do for no particular reason despite the lack of value in the task.  It feels like something I'd be better at if I were drunken and/or edging myself to overcome emotional resistance.  At least this time it's for academic credit, though Simpsons media in the Meteorology course and ubiquitous spelling errors in the Envs-Sci curriculum make it feel like academic credit is only available due to its total worthlessness.  Just like the "friendship" that I was producing porn for.
