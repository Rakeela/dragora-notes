# ENVS100 NW State Parks Essay

(Copied from ENVS&100 to-do list)
 - Write a two page paper on one of the State or Federal parks in Washington State.  (Due Feb 3)
   - Describe the diversity of organisms, the natural resources, and the ecosystem services it provides.
   - Describe what if any economic benefit the park provides.
   - Double spaced, 1 inch margins, at most 12 point font.
   - Bibliography on page three, APA format.

I need to provide a summary catalogue of flora and fauna in the chosen park, as well as show my grasp of the concept of ecosystem services through applying the concept to evaluating a real world ecosystem.  That is the task as I understand it.  However, I'm unclear as to what natural resources state parks can provide.

To what extent are they still worked for resources?  Does natural resources have a salient meaning other than referring to resource extraction processes?  Does the task require me to write about what natural resources are being foregone by society in keeping the park pristine?  Does this relate to the conservation function of parks through providing real examples of natural environments as they would be, with the resources that they would have, if humanity did not exhaust the landscape for resources?  Which is to say, is a state park also a museum of natural resources?

Finding uncertainty in the task description like this is uncomfortable, though as I am starting this in the middle of a sleepless night, it will be some hours before I can reasonably question the teacher.  Answering this could be important for determining the economic benefit of the park, as well.
