# ENVS100 NW State Parks Essay

(Copied from ENVS&100 to-do list)
 - Write a two page paper on one of the State or Federal parks in Washington State.  (Due Feb 3)
   - Describe the diversity of organisms, the natural resources, and the ecosystem services it provides.
   - Describe what if any economic benefit the park provides.
   - Double spaced, 1 inch margins, at most 12 point font.
   - Bibliography on page three, APA format.

I need to provide a summary catalogue of flora and fauna in the chosen park, as well as show my grasp of the concept of ecosystem services through applying the concept to evaluating a real world ecosystem.  That is the task as I understand it.  However, I'm unclear as to what natural resources state parks can provide.

To what extent are they still worked for resources?  Does natural resources have a salient meaning other than referring to resource extraction processes?  Does the task require me to write about what natural resources are being foregone by society in keeping the park pristine?  Does this relate to the conservation function of parks through providing real examples of natural environments as they would be, with the resources that they would have, if humanity did not exhaust the landscape for resources?  Which is to say, is a state park also a museum of natural resources?

Finding uncertainty in the task description like this is uncomfortable, though as I am starting this in the middle of a sleepless night, it will be some hours before I can reasonably question the teacher.  Answering this could be important for determining the economic benefit of the park, as well.

I think the block of questions that I wrote is very remarkable as a well of essay potential.  If I push through with the potential misunderstanding of the state park system as a free-growing museum of natural resources that we need only protect, I suspect I could put together something *very* charismatic.  Who would tell me such a concept was wrong?  I would be praising the beauty of the very stones in those places!

I'm still uncertain.  I put a search for Natural Resources across the internet, and found the Washington State Parks page on Natural Resources, found here:  https://parks.state.wa.us/358/Natural-Resources

"The Natural Resources Program's primary goal is to restore and protect the agency's natural resources, while providing safe and aesthetic environments in which the public can recreate. Current efforts include addressing sensitive species conservation, forest health conditions, controlling invasive species, and collecting resource inventories while supporting applied research and strategic planning. To advance this work, natural resource scientists and managers work directly with park staff, sister agencies, non-profit conservation organizations, and volunteers."
(Above quotation retrieved Jan 31, 2021)

This doesn't answer my uncertainty.  Are sensitive species considered natural resources?  Is forest health a natural resource?  Are invasive species nega-resources?  What goes into a resource inventory?  What do natural resource scientists research?  I have more questions now, but I also have more search direction.  As well, the page discusses salmon recovery efforts quite prominently, and this suggests that salmon and everything salmon require may be considered as natural resources.

I'm actually really unimpressed with the amount of insight this page offers into what the Washington State Parks National Resources Program is actually doing.  What's the program for?  What's a resource inventory?  This could be so much more informative in a public services sense.  Surely I'm not to believe that salmon are the only resource in the national parks.

Searching for "natural resource scientists" lead me to this:  http://www.resourcescientists.com/

This was the top hit.  They're water specialists.  This talks about "resource management and restoration plans", "biological resource projects", "habitat restoration measures involving large-scale monitoring projects", and "natural resource mitigation and enhancement programs".  Client states are listed as California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Nevada, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, and "along the gulf of Mexico".  I'm still a little unclear what natural resources are in context, but this looks very proximate to salmon.  They're really focused on waterways.  Is the WSP National Resources Program all about fish?

I also found something interesting at the Department of the Interior website, here:  https://www.doi.gov/careers/occupational-series/natural-resources-management-and-biological-sciences

"Natural resource specialists study sensitive habitats, develop natural resources regulations and guidance, help protect lives, property, and resources from fires, inventory and monitor wildlife or vegetation, analyze and mitigate environmental impacts, and restore and protect threatened animals and plants. The duties performed by DOI natural resource specialists vary greatly by location, bureau, and position."
(Above quotation retrieved Jan 31, 2021)

This is about natural resource specialists, not natural resource scientists.  Still, it's getting closer to telling me what natural resources are.  I'm getting the impression that "natural resources" in the environmental context amounts to "anything conceivably valuable in nature".  It's all the stuff humanity wants to protect in wilderness areas.  Maybe I can still throw a sentence in about geology, but it doesn't look like preserving stones for the future is very high on the agenda.

This is kind of fascinating.  "What if any" was how the teacher presented the subject matter's economic importance as well.  I get the sense that I'm supposed to scavenge for a belief in economic gains here, but I'm not sure they're here to be found.  I see a lot of unclear language.  Despite this, I do believe very strongly in environmental protection as a pillar of long-term economic advantage.  I believe in ecosystem services.  I see this concern as being of a kind with, though differing in scale from, my thoughts on geo-engineering.

I don't want to be doing this.  I only care about environmentalism because I'm obligated to.  I'd still plate the wilderness with metal to control conditions in it if I could.  I'd fill space with mirrors and cover the ocean with them, all to make sure infrared radiation was going where civilization wanted it.  I don't... care about the natural world.  I care only grudgingly about wild animals, whose existence I see as so bleak and horrific that it hurts to think about them.  If we could just reduce it all to computronium and reimplement it in simulation, we could implement it without suffering.  No sentience should need to suffer.

This universe is just so cosmically ugly, and I'm not referring to how it /looks/.  It /looks/ beautiful.  I wish it actually were.

I wish we could launch a solar shade made of solar panels with orbital installations turning the energy thus captured into hydrogen fuel for the space economy.

This feels like writing porn for online "friends" did.  Like something appalling that I'm obligated to do for no particular reason despite the lack of value in the task.  It feels like something I'd be better at if I were drunken and/or edging myself to overcome emotional resistance.  At least this time it's for academic credit, though Simpsons media in the Meteorology course and ubiquitous spelling errors in the Envs-Sci curriculum make it feel like academic credit is only available due to its total worthlessness.  Just like the "friendship" that I was producing porn for.

I usually write essays by writing out my thoughts and then refining them.  If I don't have pre-existing thoughts on a subject, I read for a bit, and then I do.  Except I don't voluntarily think about national parks.  My usual thoughts about this subject are essentially, "Hey, you know what'd be great about Mars?  We wouldn't need to build any national parks."  I like national parks in Civ 6 more than I like them IRL.

I'm trying to read Mountains without Handrails in the hopes of finding thoughts that I can use as a draft seed.  It isn't working, so far.

---
Do national parks at least support environmentalism?  My attitude about environmentalism being an appalling, unpleasant necessity does at least make me happy to see environmentalism more widely supported...

I know ecotourism can be classified as an economic value.  There's no real question to me that ecotourism is really important to many economies.  Is it important to any economies in Washington State?  Maybe I would feel better in this assignment if I knew which park in my state was most economically vital to its surrounding area.  I'm not sure how to find that, but looking up general economic value research would be reassuring as well.

I've found this at once:  https://www.nps.gov/subjects/socialscience/tev.htm

"Total Economic Value of the National Park Service
A study by Colorado State University and Harvard Kennedy School of Government"
(Above quote retrieved 2021-2-1)

This may qualify as a scientific source for the purpose of the essay.  If it does not, it may help me find what should.  This lacks ideal specificity; it is about the park as a whole.  I would want more local data for an ideal source, as ideally it would relate to the economic value of any specific state park in Washington.

Hmm, where this says 'vastly under-estimated' at the start of the third section, I wish it had said 'intrinsically under-estimated' instead.  Intrinsic also has good hyperbolic weight while retaining the advantage of technical accuracy.  It is intrinsic that standard accounting and budgetary methods will under-value non-market value.  Whether that intrinsic undervaluation is also vast is harder to establish.  There's a grammatical error as well, as the list of federal agencies using "willingness to pay" for cost-benefit analyses starts rather confusingly with "including the and".  My perceived quality of this information is declining.  It took a bit of a knock when it used the word conservative four times in a paragraph on page five, but that was referring to the survey's estimation procedures; it could be technical, in which case I'm simply unfamiliar with the verbiage.

There's an interesting categorical described on page 9:
  "1.  National Parks that focus on the preservation of nature and nature-based recreation,
  2.  Parks that focus on the preservation of American history and culture or the commemoration and remembrance of significant events and people and
  3.  Parks that focus on protecting shorelines and bodies of water."
(Above quote retrieved 2021-2-1)

The focus of the Washington State Parks material that I dug up indicates that Washington State operates parks only for category 3, else they would have included information about more than just salmon protection on their sites.  I knew there was something fishy about that material.  Overall, I'm getting the impression that Washington State's park services are managed in an opaque and potentially unprofessional way.  I'm kind of reminded of a local corruption scandal.

https://www.king5.com/article/news/investigations/renton-contractor-pleads-guilty-in-king-county-drainage-district-corruption-case/281-aa1bb369-3857-4cac-b03b-3dd22bba2028
(Content refers to information retrieved 2021-2-1)

King County Drainage Ditch 5 turned out to be nothing but a moneybleed worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to its operator.  Catching the commissioner took 35 years.  For the record, I think it'd be better to eliminate environmental protections than tolerate corruption, although I know I 'technically' shouldn't be thinking about that.  This is just me being unimpressed with my area.  I've no evidence of anything but poor copy-editing and an obtrusively incomplete internet presence.

I think that's part of the problem with things that get too popular.  They end up infested with corrupted loyalists who are using popularity to cover something intrinsically unpopular.  That might be what's wrong with environmentalism globally; I've wondered about it before.  In terms of sheer weather control, the problem is fundamentally technological.  Yet what happened when environmentalism and industry touched?  The connection corrupted.  Instead of neo-industrial fervor for new methods of energy exploitation as humanity reacted with in an earlier era, we got greenwashing status quo maintenance and conspicuous nondisruption.  Whenever people are invoking existential risk, we need neo-industrial fervor.  The global medical system has done better at ramping up to meet the challenge of COVID-19 and more than comparable environmentalist projects have been able to put together.

We need experiments at scale.  I believe a mirror-drone fleet to tamper with a regional precipitation pattern would be a smaller investment than a hydroelectric dam.  It couldn't make the rain fall on schedule, but it could dampen fluctuations.  To move beyond what is strictly self-interested (at least in an "I had this idea" sense), if we're really facing down a permanent disruption we need to be embracing the risk of creating moonscapes somewhere if doing so is truly vital to saving everywhere.  I'm referring to rare earth extraction with that line; I fully support green electronics programs as a prescient policy, but I think it should occur /with/ rare earth extraction programs.  We can't refabricate civilization's entire energy extraction and distribution infrastructure plus swathes of its industrial and transit infrastructure without building an awful lot of factories churning out an awful lot of goods.

...but I'm supposed to be thinking about national parks, eh.

What's wrong with the environment is logistics!  It's about how we're distributing resources.  What do national parks even have to do with that?

Well, I suppose I've managed to assemble the material for a hellfire draft if I want to play Lucifer's Light.  I haven't figured out the god's plan perspective here, which is more like what I need if I want to present the system as wonderful and vital to forever.  The mandatory agreement factor of the environmental courses is improper.  They're a little rude, and yet agreement is still mandatory.  They haven't the gravity (dignity) for their gravity (necessity).

Yet I do approximately trust in the value of ecosystem services.  I wouldn't try to replace all trees with artificial air filters, though I might build a few more moss-filter installations than nature herself would construct.  I mean, I wouldn't trust a swamp to filter drinking water, but they're... essential somehow, right?  To exactly that task, right?  Wetlands keep the watershed clean... somehow.  There's a faith involved in accepting all this stuff, and I'm not sure about my relationship with faith.  It really seems to me that we need clean industry more than we need clean parklands.

---
Clearly, I need to study ecosystem services more.

The book describes some forest ecosystem services on page 194:
"Besides hosting biodiversity, a typical forest supplies us with many vital ecosystem services (pp. 4, 39, 172; FIGURE 9.6).  As plants grow, their roots stabilize the soil and help to prevent erosion.  Trees' roots draw minerals up from deep soil layers and deliver them to surface layers where other plants can use them.  Plants also return organic material to the sop-soil when they die or drop their leaves.  When rain falls, leaves and leaf litter intercept water, slowing runoff.  This helps water soak into the ground to nourish roots and recharge aquifers, thereby preventing flood, reducing soil erosion, and helping keep streams and rivers clean.  Forest plants also filter pollutants and purify water as they take it up from the soil and release it to the atmosphere by the process of transpiration (p. 41).  Plants release the oxygen that we breathe, regulate moisture and precipitation, and moderate climate."

This looks like a standard litany.  Then, presumably, the value of a national forest is all of these things.  It is maintaining soil quality, purifying rainfall, and preventing the land from drying out.

Now, soil quality is an interesting one in this case, because the soil in the national forest is only being used to grow forest...  Still, I think it's valid.  National forests provide relic biomes likely to maintain different soil quality traits over time while showcasing well-adapted life to that soil.  The many microbiomes of an intact forest provide ready comparison of a wide range of soil qualities, vs industrial agricultural conditions which tend to produce a uniform subpar mediocrity if soil quality is not being watched with a substantial affection, and a still-uniform presumed optimum if that affection is present.

Purifying rainfall and preventing the land from drying out seem quite straightforward.  To that I would add, dustcatching.  The wind carries particulates on it, far more than we can perceive, and some of what we can't perceive in particulate form is outright sand, dirt, dust, and other kinds of grit.  An abrasive wind that pours over a flat landscape is likely to apply frictional pressures to that land which give it ever more fine-ground grit to pick up and blow around, but if that wind runs into a forest it will die upon the leaves.  The air that blows past a canopy is cleaner than the air which doesn't.  I think cities could gain more benefit from this than they do if they planned their parks with denser canopies.  The tree is a fascinating organism in that its whole form is designed to gather resources.  Not only does it take in light from the sky with its leaves, it also takes in topsoil from the sky with its leaves.  These three functions make tree-planting excellent against desertification and national forests stand as walls against the advance of dusty aridity.

...now this is looking more like draft material.  Yes, I do think I'll have this essay done in due time.

The extensive development of national parks and forests across the Pacific Northwest must be contributing to our clean air and our wonderful rainy climate.  Topsoil retention and regional environmental study is likely also amplifying agricultural productivity, and I see when I look this up (retrieved 2021-2-1 from https://www.nasda.org/organizations/washington-state-department-of-agriculture#:~:text=Washington%20ranks%20first%20in%20the,including%20potatoes%2C%20grapes%20and%20onions) that Washington is the most important producer state in the USA for various fruits, and the second most important producer state for wine and several vegetables, including one of my favorites: onions!  Washington state is much better for agriculture than I expected, but I only looked up the information because I noticed that the high quality of environmental protection made possible by our well-protected forests might be creating conditions amenable for growing.  I would also be surprised if growers in this state were ever ill-informed about the importance of soil quality.

Yet from that same source I notice to my surprise that Eastern Washington is described as desert-like, with irrigated and dry land farms.  How strange that is to think, when I tend to imagine myself to be living in 'the rainforest state'!  If I load up the satellite view of Washington state, I can see the desert-looking region.  Having grown up in the midwest where the farms are interspersed by forest rows and every so often the forests eat up a few fields contiguously, the lack of trees in Eastern Washington looks strange and appalling to me.  The hedgerows in Illinois are such an important part of keeping it agricultural productive.  Can sparse trees on the satellite image of Eastern Washington really be good agricultural management?  If the local environment out there can't support tree stands without a lot of help, these farms are a bit questionably sited, but definitely they should be using something else for soil retention.  This purpose can also be served by low stone walls.  Each such wall is a point where wind-blown grit can catch on so it isn't lost to the farmer who built the wall.  New topsoil will even blow in if not too many farmers are doing it.

This line of thought has me thinking that one of the functions of a national forest is to forgive the sins of farmers who don't know what they're doing.  I'm looking at these maps and trying to imagine the wind lines...  They're not that bad.  There are enough land and forest barriers to keep those dry sections contained.  It might still be a good idea for farmers to wall them in, but I think I can see why Eastern Washington is agriculturally productive.  They have hills and/or forests guarding their topsoil.  This might be a good candidate for looking up scientific research about... though I worry that the 'specify parks' part might make it difficult.  A lot more has been proven somewhere than has been proven everywhere.  If I have to find research indicating the specific values of a specific park in Washington State, I'm concerned that I may not be able to acquire that information fast enough to complete this assignment.

---
Putting in a breakpoint here to wonder about something else.  How do I draft this thing to a specific length?  Do I blather for two pages in a word document, then trim, check, and revise?  I think I *can*... maybe...  It's much easier to talk about conceptual forests and measurements that could be taken than actual forests and measurements that have been taken.  I can't necessarily find those measurements, arbitrary measurements useful to my purposes may not exist to be found, and taking them myself is wholly not an option.

---
Does this need a thesis statement?  It's probably good practice to include one...  My thesis statement could be something like, "The economic value of the national parks is in the long-term ecosystem services that they provide."  Alternatively, if I want to be culturally ambitious, "The economic function of a national forest is to forgive the sins of farmers who don't know how to manage their land."  That's a bit of an open palm slap, though very evocative.  I would say "and nobody in the slapped population is present in the course", but that's not the right way to think about it; I should only say it if I'd defend it to a farmer.  Which might make it a good thesis statement.  The paper defends the thesis, and it would pull the essay taut around a subject fluid to me.

I'm still struggling to find which park to focus on.  For proving value to agriculture, one of the fewer parks in Eastern Washington may be better than one of the more numerous parks in Western Washington.  I know that there's agriculture in the valleys of Western Washington as well, but it's not quite as obvious on satellite, nor as monodominant of local economies, whereas Eastern Washington would almost remind me of where I grew up if there were more trees between the fields that sprawl for miles in every direction.

---
Since this has a page count and formatting mandates, I can't draft it here.  Yet I do have my first draft finished.  I just need to find stuff I can cite about it.
