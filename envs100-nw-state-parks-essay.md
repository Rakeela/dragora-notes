# ENVS100 NW State Parks Essay

(Copied from ENVS&100 to-do list)
 - Write a two page paper on one of the State or Federal parks in Washington State.  (Due Feb 3)
   - Describe the diversity of organisms, the natural resources, and the ecosystem services it provides.
   - Describe what if any economic benefit the park provides.
   - Double spaced, 1 inch margins, at most 12 point font.
   - Bibliography on page three, APA format.

I need to provide a summary catalogue of flora and fauna in the chosen park, as well as show my grasp of the concept of ecosystem services through applying the concept to evaluating a real world ecosystem.  That is the task as I understand it.  However, I'm unclear as to what natural resources state parks can provide.

To what extent are they still worked for resources?  Does natural resources have a salient meaning other than referring to resource extraction processes?  Does the task require me to write about what natural resources are being foregone by society in keeping the park pristine?  Does this relate to the conservation function of parks through providing real examples of natural environments as they would be, with the resources that they would have, if humanity did not exhaust the landscape for resources?  Which is to say, is a state park also a museum of natural resources?

Finding uncertainty in the task description like this is uncomfortable, though as I am starting this in the middle of a sleepless night, it will be some hours before I can reasonably question the teacher.  Answering this could be important for determining the economic benefit of the park, as well.

I think the block of questions that I wrote is very remarkable as a well of essay potential.  If I push through with the potential misunderstanding of the state park system as a free-growing museum of natural resources that we need only protect, I suspect I could put together something *very* charismatic.  Who would tell me such a concept was wrong?  I would be praising the beauty of the very stones in those places!

I'm still uncertain.  I put a search for Natural Resources across the internet, and found the Washington State Parks page on Natural Resources, found here:  https://parks.state.wa.us/358/Natural-Resources

"The Natural Resources Program's primary goal is to restore and protect the agency's natural resources, while providing safe and aesthetic environments in which the public can recreate. Current efforts include addressing sensitive species conservation, forest health conditions, controlling invasive species, and collecting resource inventories while supporting applied research and strategic planning. To advance this work, natural resource scientists and managers work directly with park staff, sister agencies, non-profit conservation organizations, and volunteers."

This doesn't answer my uncertainty.  Are sensitive species considered natural resources?  Is forest health a natural resource?  Are invasive species nega-resources?  What goes into a resource inventory?  What do natural resource scientists research?  I have more questions now, but I also have more search direction.  As well, the page discusses salmon recovery efforts quite prominently, and this suggests that salmon and everything salmon require may be considered as natural resources.

I'm actually really unimpressed with the amount of insight this page offers into what the Washington State Parks National Resources Program is actually doing.  What's the program for?  What's a resource inventory?  This could be so much more informative in a public services sense.  Surely I'm not to believe that salmon are the only resource in the national parks.
