I shouldn't bother attending my calculus classes except on quiz days.  I gain nothing from the lecture.  I can even see the board from the back of the class now with the superpower of having new glasses, but I'm not getting anything from watching the teacher work through the problems.

I need to study this subject so much to understand it, and I fear I won't get any insight, but will just be roting my way through yet another math class.
