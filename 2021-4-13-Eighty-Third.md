I have to run an errand, but I wanted to set a note to self for myself to fill out a node for the [[Northern-Creche-Confederation]].  It's [[dragon]] lore.  From a dragon society that talked too much and didn't usually get things done by killing each other.  I've decided that I should record more about it.

And no, I was never talking about any earthly context, when I in "childhood" spoke of my species going north for childrearing.  Your fucked up human psychology...  Humans who seek isolation for childrearing are pedophiles, but of MY species, we were seeking somewhere to raise children where they didn't have to hide in terror from a humanity that saw young dragons as easy victims.

If you build a grid of electromagnets under a roadway, could you run a hovercar across the top of it stably, without sliding?  I'm imagining a hybrid forced air and electromagnetism system which achieves the frictionless performance of an e-lev train with the maneuverability of a hovercar, and perhaps better than the maneuverability of a hovercar without such a system.

I think if we move away from a wheels-on-the-ground model, people may understand arcology construction more as well.  It isn't *logically* necessary or even *helpful* for the vehicle to not be on the ground... I think... but I think that if everything is levitating, peoples' imaginations will go more vertical.  I'm imagining boostshafts with no underlying plate, where the walls of the shaft apply the force that lifts the vehicle when it is being moved between levels.  Maybe with latch-arms that apply to the side of the vehicle, maybe with forced air vents under them...  Mobile slanted forced air vents that move along with the vehicles, so that multiple hover-cars can be travelling on the same vertical roadway at the same time...  I wish I could whistle.

I'm not going to invest my life into making it possible, but...  I dunno.  People are so uncreative.  I wish I had more of the health that most people take for granted, and that they had more of the mind that I take for granted.

In hindsight, I think the wind goddess' church were approximately correct about the right way to live with their support of living openly, although...  Kairn was killed by an inquisitor who pursued too ferociously a violation of the church's integrity and enchanted the rest of us to be her instruments of holy vengeance.  That didn't really convince me that they were doing the right thing.  Also, being puppeteered for murderous purposes kind of broke my mind.

I wonder if it'll ever be socially acceptable to be 'grumpy'.  I didn't consider grumpiness a personal failing of Vellos, I liked that he could be metaphorically spiny.  I liked that we had a society where he could have spines and I could have armor, even if I didn't realize at the time that everyone was treating it as blunt metaphors for trauma.

I just thought of something about sci-fi.  A lot of sci-fi artists know that symmetry is 'more attractive' than asymmetry, and so they use symmetry as part of their determination for whether or not an alien is supposed to look appealing.  Yet intraspecific variation is a thing, and varying the extent of symmetry could be used to indicate it more than it currently is.  A slightly misshapen alien of the same species would still be less appealing than a very symmetrical representation, and having both in the same setting would make them both more believable.

This could be used to tell stories based on attractiveness as well.  Ugly villains, ugly heroes.  More people would be blind to the attractiveness cue in an alien species, which could be an asset to the author or even a plot point in the story.

I met another fucked up loyalist today.  As usual, they pumped me for information while reminding me in petty ways that I couldn't "force" them to be honest.  Deception is still a violation of consent.  I wish society were more consensual.

The fact that I'm powerless against it doesn't make deception LESS of a violation of consent.
