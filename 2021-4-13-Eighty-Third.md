#2021-4-13-Eighty-Third

I have to run an errand, but I wanted to set a note to self for myself to fill out a node for the [[Northern-Creche-Confederation]].  It's [[dragon]] lore.  From a dragon society that talked too much and didn't usually get things done by killing each other.  I've decided that I should record more about it.

And no, I was never talking about any earthly context, when I in "childhood" spoke of my species going north for childrearing.  Your fucked up human psychology...  Humans who seek isolation for childrearing are pedophiles, but of MY species, we were seeking somewhere to raise children where they didn't have to hide in terror from a humanity that saw young dragons as easy victims.
