I wonder if it would be possible to make the immune system forget the body was ever infected by diseases whose antibodies also provoke autoimmunity.  I want to know the connection between schizophrenia and the Epstein Barr virus.

I've only read the abstract here.  It talks about "association".  I'm left wondering what I should understand from this.  Is it possible that schizophrenia is caused by an antibody to Epstein Barr virus that also targets something essential in the body?  Or is this "association" merely something that worsens the symptoms from schizophrenia when present?

Even if it merely increases the symptoms from schizophrenia, it makes me wonder if it would possibly be helpful to make the immune system forget its antibody to the Epstein Barr virus.  But would people then get horrible adult cases of viral mononucleosis?  Maybe a custom antibody to Epstein Barr virus could be engineered that would be different from the circulating antibody in schizophrenics, conferring immunity without the side effect.  This may be something for my [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]]... although going through that file would be a project of its own at this point.  I think I want to archive what's in there and start anew.

Gosh though, that was ambitious.  To think I could write an essay about why RNA vaccination should be studied as a potential source of new treatments for schizophrenia!  I didn't manage to achieve it.  Maybe I need another essay-writing class next semester to help me retain the lessons about how to write essays.  <3
