I'm a little bit skeptical of the concept of men who want nothing but sex and prefer it anonymous.  I think that our society intensely sexually objectifies men.  Our society does this not by saying that men are sexually valuable, but by saying that men *are* sex.  The mesage is that men want nothing but sex, are motivated by nothing but sex, and that ultimately all male motivations reduce to sex.  Anything cool that a man does must be because they want sex.  Nothing men can do resists devaluing it by calling it all about sex.

If women are treated that way, *we don't have trouble seeing them as objectified*.  That is generally recognized as a kind of sexual objectification when women are given that treatment.  Furthermore, AFAIK women who are treated that way react by shutting down emotionally.  They get colder, more withdrawn, and more hostile.  Compare that response profile to what's observed of men considered deficient and "unemotional"...  I don't think it's coincidental that the "cold male" stereotype is similar to the "intimately abused human" stereotype.  Men are, obligatorily and ubiquitously throughout our culture, just sex, and they react in a way that society ostensibly understands people to react when everything in their life is presumed to be about sex.

I think our society doesn't have the words for the concept that men would not be sex.  I don't mean literally - the words to describe the concept aren't hard to find, and there certainly *are* men who espouse asexuality.  What we lack the words to describe is that men who retreat into porn may not be sex.  The obligatory normal reaction is to see those men being *especially* nothing but sex, and I would propose that's exactly reversed.  I see a pattern of withdrawn grim immersion.  **I did exactly that for years to try to find value in stuff I didn't like.**

If someone who is treated as nothing but sex also conceives of themselves the same way, their withdrawal from sex is going to look distorted.  I was in that position.  My own withdrawal from sex involved prolonged avoidance, but it followed the pattern of looking hypersexual.  I strongly preferred inanimate, no-pressure sources of sex (porn and games) over interactive, challenging sources of sex (cybersex clients).  I looked like I was immersed in porn, but I was actually avoiding sex.  Unlike a lot of men who do that, I had some self-insight... although my hermaphroditic identity might have mattered more, because I felt many confusing and forlorn twinges of 'that's me... but I'm not allowed to say it' at rhetoric against sexual objectification.  I envied women for their right to say no, and for society's willingness to define the achievements of women by metrics other than sex appeal.

Men don't have that.  Men are supposed to do literally anything for sex appeal.  **Unsexy men are considered failed men**, and to an extraordinary degree.  That's sexual objectification.

I also had the advantage that sex was my job.  I was studying inanimate, no-pressure sources of sex "for work".  To "get better at it".  I had to come up for air sometimes, and I even had to go out and try to serve clients sometimes.  I was trying to be the good whore, professionally developing myself so that I'd be more capable of meeting people's sexual needs... by all power, that was dreary.

"God, that's dreary," is kind of the reaction that people are *almost* having usefully around men who withdraw.  They recognize that nothing is happening in the lives of those men...  They SEE the dreariness, but then their reaction is to heap abuse on the men who are drearily withdrawn!  If anyone encounters such a man, our society today is constructed to victimize them.  What is rational behavior if someone is likely to get victimized whenever they stick their head up?  They withdraw.  Which... is the problem being complained about.  Are humans not sapient enough to recognize that punishing withdrawn people for sticking their heads up will not make people less withdrawn?

I don't think asexual awareness is the answer.  It's hard to say why; I know I didn't realize asexuality was real.  Mel-the-character was the only asexual I'd ever met, but the player behind the character is the person I was really attached to, and Mel's player was not asexual.  I thought asexuality was for [[character-gallery.md|characters like Chimes]], who aren't equipped for sex.  Puzzlebox certainly had space for characters not equipped for sex, but in general it didn't help me feel like being unsexy was okay; that was part of Yoet's suffering.

I think male contraceptives are an important part of the answer.  Letting men control their fertility will give them a tool against sexual pressures.  It will help reduce the likelihood of children being born into relationships where their mother thinks their father is nothing but sex.  That will mean more engaged fathers, without any social pressure needing to be applied to achieve it.

I think part of the answer involves respecting that men are capable of non-sexual achievements, too.  I think more of what men *do* needs to be considered respectable for purposes other than sex.  We need the idea that men, like women, are capable of wanting to achieve cool stuff because the stuff is cool.  The idea that men only ever do things to appeal to better women needs to be rejected as the sexual objectification that it would be recognized as were it said that women only ever do things to appeal to better men.
