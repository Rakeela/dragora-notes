10:15.  Yesterday's treadmill use was...  15 miles.  2,581 kcal.  54,441 steps.  11 hours, 19 minutes, 40 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  I'm not supposed to use the treadmill for more than nine hours, but I've rankled at and begun to ignore that limitation.

14:06.  I've been up for four hours and my head is just empty.  I'm such a waste of breath right now.

14:10.  I dreamed last night of a contingent story with three major variations.  It continued in a similar though not identical way on all three paths.

14:17.  Head.  Empty.  I devoured a candy bar.  I'm so bad.  I should fast.  I can't fast though, I'm supposed to take a stool sample because there's been litter in my stool.  And I'm too horrified by taking stool samples to do it.

14:18.  I wanted to start a new project instead of working on Kura and Kaire again.  I'm not convinced Kura and Kaire is good writing.

14:21.  I want to write more thrillingly.  Kistaro encouraged me to write uniquely.  Theoma isn't especially thrilling, but it's very unique.  I want to write an HSD novel to practice writing thrillingly.  I adore Hc Svnt Dracones.  Maybe my story would seem excellent enough to publish as an official HSD product.  If not, it could be scrubbed of trademarked material and published under my own name.

14:25.  I don't actually have any ideas for a Hc Svnt Dracones book.  My head is just... empty.  I was going to start on it today.  I'd want to use Ermolai, but I feel like I shouldn't.  I wouldn't want to use the plotline I'm planning for the tabletop game.  That campaign is going to face the rise of Lucent, a third hostile MCM, but I don't want to introduce that to the setting in a novel.

14:33.  I don't think my writing for Lucent is cool enough to become canon.  It should do for a player party.

14:36.  Hm...  A plot generator suggests I could maybe do something with a legendary cruise ship.

14:41.  Maybe it's a wrecked cruise ship, derelict in the void of space, and someone hires a crew of salvagers to...  That's Captain Diunikel's Salvage Service.  Though in her setting, the crew is almost all synthetic, and she's definitely not from Hc Svnt Dracones.  Hm.  I want the protagonists to have some possibility of claiming the title on the derelict, so I don't want them to be hired to strip or reclaim it on behalf of someone else.

14:49.  What would stop a legendary cruise liner from being salvaged promptly?  Destruction by Whispers would do it.  If the cruise liner has whisperwerk on it, everyone would be afraid to touch it.

14:52.  The amount of firepower needed to reclaim it would become awesome though, and it would spoil the image of Whispers as legendary threats.  Not a good book option.  Whispers should be climactic battles, not selected targets.

14:53.  What if it was falsely claimed to have been destroyed by Whispers, when in fact no Whispers had manifested on it?  What if someone wanted the liner to remain a drifting hulk in space, and fabricated a disaster, culminating in 'leaked video' of a Whisper attack with mass casualties, when in fact the video was just simulation?  The exterior of the ship should still have 'whisperwerk' on it to keep away people viewing it from long-distance scopes, but the red crystal on the exterior should be fabbed replace rather than real.

14:55.  Maybe the culprits of the fake attack wanted the ship to be destroyed in the aftermath of their attack on it, but naval fleets in the area declined to confront the whispers, opting to leave the ship to drift dead.

14:56.  The attackers who destroyed the ship and fabricated a Whisper assault to cover their tracks were left nervous by the abandonment of the hulk, but as long as nobody investigated, their tracks were still covered.  So a crew of salvagers landing on the vessel pose a real threat...

14:57.  I'm thinking the salvage group gets a tip-off of some sort, too.  They get a first bit of evidence that says it wasn't a Whisper attack.  Let's say...  someone in the attacker group feels deep shame over what they did, and leaks something without being caught.  They can't leak everything and they can't help the salvagers.  They just leak enough to draw interest.

15:02.  The leak is just the same video that was released to the media when the ship was initially attacked, but this time the meta-data on the released file clearly indicates that it was made by an AI incident simulator.

22:54.  I've been generating characters.  I'm trying to figure out the right balance between capable and overpowering.  I want the characters to seem highly competent, but I want dramatic tension, too.

23:44.  The first chapter of Fate's Fangs establishes a sympathetic nobody protagonist with minimal power over her life, a very minimal social life with only one friend, an untrustworthy and controlling boss, a dirty environment that she longs to escape, a longing to get to a whole new planet, and a bright, inquiring mind.

23:48.  Can I...  Emulate that?  How much of that is gold?  I lean towards power fantasies.  A lot of good stories start with very disempowered characters.

23:50.  I could start with a lateral protagonist.  I mean, I was thinking about making Ermolai the protagonist, but...  Ermolai doesn't feel disempowered.  He doesn't feel flawed.  He feels greedy.  He wants enough credits to remake his body.

23:54.  The Society of the Great Deception.  The cruise liner wasn't recently attacked.  It's one of the biggest mobile ships in Sol's history.  It was attacked by a group intending to found a grotto in its hulk.  They got word that it was carrying a GeoMat in its guts.  They weren't expecting the local navies to attack it, they were...  no, this is a bad idea.  There's no way that a liner that big would be recoverable.  It would practically be a city in its own right.  Ermolai would never hear of that and think, "My little merc company can go conquer that!"

23:59.  Okay.  Reporting my daily treadmill usage.  14.6 miles.  2,523 kcal.  53,009 steps.  11 hours, 3 minutes, 50 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  I think this thing undercounts steps, but I'm not making any specific projection about what I think my step count would have been.
