94,620 words on the draft.  Take one down, pass it around, 94,619 words on the draft.

One chapter down.  94,472 words on the draft.  I'd already been through this chapter before, but I still found more trimming to be done.  13,685 words left on my target of 15k words of draft trimming.

The next chapter is notably oversized at 8367 words.  I want my chapters between 3k and 5k words.  If I can find a good splitting point, I'll make two chapters out of this one, but I'll start by trimming it.

Chapter split!  94,024 words on the draft.  13,237 words left to remove.  I've left behind a chapter of 2,902 words.  That length is great.  I really enjoyed rereading it, too.  That enjoyment made trimming the material harder but more fun.

Chapter finished.  93,504 words on the draft.  12,717 words to remove.  This chapter has been trimmed down to 4,494 words, which is tolerable although not excellent.

The next chapter is fairly reasonably sized at 4,846 words, but I'll see if I can trim it anyways.  I found an opportunity to increase the scaliness of this one.

Chapter finished?  I only took it down to 4,517 words.  I feel like I wasn't very intensive about my editing.  Maybe I didn't do terribly well.  Anyways.  93,175 words on the draft.  12,388 words left on my 15k trimming project.  That's 2,612 words trimmed so far on Ekis' Travelogue.

The next chapter is also reasonable at 4,079 words.  I thought I was writing 10,000 word chapters!  On review, it looks like I didn't actually do that, but there are a few other 8k+ chapters that will need to be split.  I think I like my chapters to be 3k words each.  Now I'm going to take a break instead of launching into editing chapter 8.
