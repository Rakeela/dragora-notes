10:48.  Temporary crown on one of my teeth.  Fading numbness from the anesthesia.  I think the dentist left a band on the tooth, and I should look.

10:49.  It feels like a band clamped to my tooth, but it's only on one side?  A band would go all the way around?  It must be the base of the temporary crown.

11:21.  This crown is not sitting comfortably.  I swear, I bit down and I felt it sink.  I'm worried it won't stay on, or that it'll be loose enough for the underlying toothstuff to decay.

13:06.  Ugh.  I'm not getting moving efficiently today.  I don't know what to write next, but my quota is pushing me to think about it.  That's what it's for!  It's not a high quota, but I gotta put effort in if I'm to achieve it!  59,074!

15:49.  59,164.  I have been playing Cultist Simulator and Nationstates.  This is practically occult activity; I am thinking about subtle influences instead of writing.

16:43.  60,060.  1,190 words on the chapter.

19:33.  61,263.  2,189 words of progress.  I've been stuck and distracted, watching Akity play Freedom City.

22:35.  8.6 miles.  1,565 kcal.  31,974 steps.  7 hours, 13 minutes, 26 seconds.
