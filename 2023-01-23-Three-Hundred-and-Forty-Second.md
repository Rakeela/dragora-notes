I forgot to record my starting point before I started, but fortunately I recorded my ending point yesterday.  Starting with 4,681 words on the file.  I should finish this file today.  It represents two chapters of Kura and Kaire.

6,313 words on the file.  1,632 words of progress.  File complete.

17,572 words on the file, then 17,575 words on the file.  1,635 words of progress.  I just noticed something that had to be added.  :)

147 words on the new file.  I'm at the limit of my inspiration.  I don't know what should happen next in the story.  1,782 words of progress.

I kept my carb intake low yesterday and I've kept it lower today.  A few pounds have melted right off.  That's glycogen weight, from stored carbohydrate energy.  It doesn't stick around when I'm not eating.  If I understand correctly, stored carbohydrates are used up quickly in the absence of carbohydrate intake.

I have completed a massive, galaxy-spanning voyage in Star Traders: Frontiers!  I criss-crossed the galaxy collecting Cadar Syndicate Capital Ship Components.  I think it took literal in-game decades to fill my cargo hold with 155 units of Capital Ship Components.  The haul is worth 702.3k credits, which I believe constitutes a minor profit for me on the expedition.  The opportunity cost was massive.  I could've completed numerous rare goods convoys over the same duration with a massive advantage in my earnings.  Cadar Syndicate loves me for this, though.

However, it's just a game, and one that I've already largely 'completed' with this captain.  I'm just wringing the file for whatever joy it can bring me.

There are so many hostile encounters in ST: F that I imagine the void is littered with the wreckage of dead ships.  I built a successful merchant.  Presumably others in the same setting can.  It's likely a studied and exacting endeavor.  Now my character has just spent decades gathering together the components for more ships to be built, and he delivered them to his home clan of Moklumnue.  A freighter full of ship components... what was it like to spend decades on a single merchant expedition?  He's immortal and he believes his society will last forever, so it wasn't like he was competing against the crush of time.  His crew is competent and happy.

I wonder if the ennui I suffer while playing him might be something that he suffers from in his own life.  He's been almost everywhere in the in-game galaxy.  The map has only a few ports left that he hasn't visited.  He's brought his hospital ship everywhere and earned the gratitude of countless people.  They've all died anyways.  They only lived a little longer because of him, and then they died.  They were 'gravs', people who live in gravity wells, and in Star Traders: Frontiers, the gravs are mortal while spacers are not.  He knows that taking a military path would have remained exciting, but he also knows that his immortality is due to him being a well-loved pacifist.  He's seen a few crew die in small fights that he couldn't avoid.  The spacer's immortality must be buttressed by avoidance of conflict in space!

He ignores wars when they break out, remaining friendly to everyone he meets.  He falsifies documents and counterfeits his identity as needed to permit him to be friendly.  He goes where he pleases, no matter the political weather.

His ship is an unstoppable force in espionage, but he often holds onto intel for so long that everyone involved in a given conflict has died before he sells their secrets.  The other people are struggling desperately and even trying to kill each other, but their wars don't matter to him.  He studies them for posterity's sake and releases their secrets later on.

He studies scientific endeavors, but he sells the info on even more slowly.  He doesn't believe his crew's scientific findings will ever matter in the long-run.  The research he leads his crew into performing is all for their own entertainment across their immortal lifespans.

That's the character I've built in Star Traders: Frontiers.
