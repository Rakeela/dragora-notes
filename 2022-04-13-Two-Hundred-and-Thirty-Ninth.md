I have a math test today, and I am dreading it.  My performance in practice and study was highly inadequate.  I found myself making progress, but too slowly.  I was suffering awful psychological side effects as I continued studying.

With a few days of studying, I expect to get a passing grade.  I really do expect that I'll pass the test.  I expect to do no better.  Hah, maybe all that studying will come back to me and I will work swiftly and well throughout!  It... would not be the first time I did better than expected on a test.  Yet I doubt it.  I expect to get a passing grade.

Hopefully my grades upon the homework will uphold my GPA.

At least this time, it seems I will not have to get "Honorlock" set up.  I am not to cheat on the test, per my agreement with the class, yet there is nothing stopping me from doing so save my own honor.  That's a proper honor-lock!  I think it'll work, too.  The grade achieved honestly is a fair reflection of my capability.

The path between where I am and an immunology degree is very long.  I'm worried I won't be able to do it.
