Cheese is such a superior snack!  I breakfasted on keto items this morning.  A keto candy and cheese!  If my body is already in ketosis, cheese provides lasting fullness!  As a breakfast, it avoids breaking night-time ketosis and does not spur the production of glycogen, causing the body to continue breaking down stored carbohydrate energy.

I've read that the body can only store 2,000 calories of carbohydrates!  When insulin levels are low in the body, stored carbohydrates are continuously drained to fuel the body's metabolism.  If one eats a lot of carbohydrates, night-time insulin lows will not drain stored carbohydrates.

I haven't figured out how to do keto vegetarianism besides cheese.  I mean, there's avocados, and I do like avocados, but there's gotta be more.  I just don't like salad enough, and vegetables aren't as free of carbs as meat and cheese.  I guess there are nuts, too.  I ate a handful of nuts here and there across the last week.
