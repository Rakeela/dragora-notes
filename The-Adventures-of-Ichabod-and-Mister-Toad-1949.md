Why, Mr. Toad is an outright crook!  Nobody struck with such manias could be an honest person.  Their mind would drive them to criminality.

Meanwhile, this is the best telling of Ichabod Crane's story I've ever found... except for No Evil's, where Ichabod was made into an actual crane.  I'm such a furry.  I prefer No Evil.
