I should be in bed (it's five past midnight), but I just tried eating three veggie straws, five cherries, and a dollop of cashew butter.  Exactly like that!  The flavor combination worked.  Now I think I may try to make a cherry-cashew fudge as my next experiment, using my recently arrived package of powdered monksfruit.  Posting this as a note-to-self for after I wake up; I tend to leave my most recent blog post up on a monitor all day.
