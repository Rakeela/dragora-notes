I've made a little more headway into my project to create Theoma lore analagous to Cultist Simulator's lore.  I've encountered a third problem.  There aren't any mythological creatures in Theoma so far.  Cultist Simulator has "labhites" as an example drawn straight from the lore cards.  One of the lore cards is "An Operation of the Labhite".  It doesn't detail what a labhite is, but looking up lore from elsewhere in the game, it seems labhites are creatures of The Lionsmith who maintain their power only on the condition that they eat only things which come from the sky.  I assume that means birds.  Theoma has nothing like that.

The lore card for "An Operation of the Labhite" reads "A series of mystic exercises that requires both dedication and terror."  What does this say about the labhite?  It says nothing to me other than that they are creatures of Edge, which is the lore of conflict.

I am interested in this, because I am shattering the lore of Edge.  The new lore in place of Edge is "Rift", and the Rift-2 lore is "A Knife's Shattering".  It is the Broken Lore in Theoma, where war is almost (though not literally) unheard of.

I'm wondering if I should create mythological creatures in Theoma.  Obviously, there's nothing mythical about dragons in Theoma, but there might be creatures maintained by the land gods who exist only under specific circumstances.  It might be a fair reference to Cultist Simulator to have "An Operation of the" retained, while replacing "Labhite" with something else.  Are there mythic creatures of Rift?  It is the lore of breaking apart conflicting parties so that they are no longer in conflict with each other. The Broken Lore might be a risky lore, even if not as risky as Edge.

An interesting event today.  While I was working in another window, one of my Rift lores blanked itself.  I restored it.  No loss.  I'm not sure what happened to it, but somehow a backspace keystroke hit it.

I'm also five days into a streak of eating in a vegetarian way.  I'm not eating vegan - I've eaten egg and dairy - but I'm not eating meat.  I'm not a vegetarian, but maybe if I say I'm not a vegetarian enough times, I'll be wrong.
