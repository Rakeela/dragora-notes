# Mitochondria

The so-called powerhouse of the cells, mitochondria are very small symbiotic bacteria which exist in all life forms more advanced than prokaryotes.  They have their own DNA separate from that of their host.  One of the factors which causes senescence is decay of the host's mitochondrial populations, so something will have to be done about mitochondrial decay in order to achieve [[rejuvenative-medical-interventions]].

How fast can mitochondria be removed from a host population of bacteria, and what is their survival rate during such transits?  How resilient are mitochondria in general?  To what degree can a mitochondrial extract be purified?

How significant is the protective efficacy of adding [[exogenous-mitochondria]] to [[ischemic-tissues]]?
