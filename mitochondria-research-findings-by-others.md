# Mitochondria Research Findings by Others

Although this is generically about mitochondria, I currently intend to link this node off of [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]] for organizational reasons.

1.  Antibiotic-resistant mitochondria can be transferred into sensitive cells to allow them to work in a selective medium: https://www.nature.com/articles/295605a0
(To-do: check if this is the general cause of antibiotic resistance.)

2.  Artificial mitochondria transfer: current challenges, advances, and future applications: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2017/7610414/#B9
(This is a very relevant source of sources.)
