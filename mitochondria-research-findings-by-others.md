# Mitochondria Research Findings by Others

Although this is generically about mitochondria, I currently intend to link this node off of [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]] for organizational reasons.  For graph organization reasons, I will also link it to [[low-salience-mitochondria-research]] and [[non-research-mitochondria-links]].

1.  Antibiotic-resistant mitochondria can be transferred into sensitive cells to allow them to work in a selective medium: https://www.nature.com/articles/295605a0
(To-do: check if this is the general cause of antibiotic resistance.)

2.  Artificial mitochondria transfer: current challenges, advances, and future applications: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2017/7610414/#B9
(This is a very relevant source of sources.)

3.  Human xenomitochondrial cybrids. Cellular models of mitochondrial complex I deficiency: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9603924/
(I'm intrigued by the mention of xenomitochondrial experimentation in this.)

4.  Rapid Isolation And Purification Of Mitochondria For Transplantation By Tissue Dissociation And Differential Filtration: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4828055/
(Describes a method for extracting "approximately 2 x 10^10 viable and respiration competent mitochondria from 0.18 Â± 0.04 g (wet weight) tissue sample"; hopefully can be adapted to yeast extractions, or point me towards something that can?)

5.  "Transfer of Xenomitochondria Containing the Entire Mouse Mitochondrial Genome into a Genetically Modified Yeast Expressing Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A"  https://europepmc.org/article/med/32627757
(This is very similar research to what I want to perform!  I want to do it with human mitochondria, and I want to take it farther seeking refinements to the process, but this is very suggestive of the viability of my idea.  It does mean that the more basic and easily performed procedures can only amount to replicating the research of others, but that's okay.  It's not exactly ancient research taken for granted.)

6. "Intramitochondrial transfer and engineering of mammalian mitochondrial genomes in yeast" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30980913/
(Stored for my records.  This was cited in #5, and if I end up using information from this research in constructing further experiments, I should have it on file.)

7. "Mitochondrial genome-maintaining activity of mouse mitochondrial transcription factor A and its transcript isoform in Saccharomyces cerevisiae"  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150443/
(Likewise stored for records.  Based on where it was cited in #5, I think I need to review this material more.)

8. "Reciprocal interactions between mtDNA and lifespan control in budding yeast" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857569/
(I found this helpful for teaching me about rho0 mitochondria.)

9. "Transferring isolated mitochondria into tissue culture cells"  https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/19/e148/2414544
(Procedural data.  I also think that "rat mtDNA initially replicated but was soon completely replaced by the injected mouse mtDNA" suggests that competitive replication pressure substantially influences mitochondrial predominance, and local selective pressures should be examined in cases of mitochondrial dysfunction.)
