Although as an [[atheist]] I do not believe in demons, I'm one of the few people on Earth who can honestly say that they've had trouble with summoned demons.  Trouble, I say...  perhaps I'm being unfair.  Although I must of course *necessarily* only be authoring fiction right now, both of the demons who I have 'met' did their very best to offer me aid.	Notably, when I called the price of my soul, I seem to have attracted two of the most redemptionist demons in demonology.

Here is a secular tale of a summoned demon: one of my most awesome characters was also one of my most messed up... and I named her *Marchosias*.  She was seeking virtue in the wrong way; she didn't know the right way, and she met nobody who understood her well enough to correct her error.  Her love was expressed with entropic fire, and she believed that if she gave her love to the world, she would someday meet a soul who would be eroded by no challenge.

I said hello to a local Stellar's Jay a few times, and it cawed at me.  Stellar's Jays are corvids, but they are not crows; 'caw' is not their usual vocalization.  They are however mimics.  I'm amused when this one mimics crows at me.  I wonder if it knows that I mostly feed crows...

Well, I distributed a few peanuts to it, and I've given a few to a crow as well.

Johnathan Haight's "Five Moral Pillars" are what convinced me that loyalty is a vice.  I understand loyalty as the 'moral' value of letting your friends get away with doing stuff that you wouldn't let your rivals get away with doing.  This struck me as a basic defense of immorality, which changed my life henceforth.  I had called myself loyal in childhood, but that had never been a willingness to let my allies get away with anything that I wouldn't let my rivals get away with; rather, it had been a highly trusting nature that believed people who said loving things would be consistent with it.
