"Reading" this book is not an accomplishment, because it's a workbook.  It skims through super fast, as it is mostly space for writing in, interspersed by plenty of blank pages for working through ideas on.  I've bought a few of these workbooks for fictional settings before, but this is the first one I'm happy with.  It's given me a good impression today.

I feel self-conscious about finding a workbook to be of good quality, because I feel like recording my own subpar ideas into someone else's excellent workbook is some kind of travesty.  I know this is improper; bad ideas plus study and reflection often leads to good ideas.  Still, I'm stuck not wanting to 'destroy' this workbook by touching it with a pen before I've planned out some way to honor its author by the full way that I use it, so that the finished workbook may be a work of art itself.

Sensibly, I may buy a second copy to have one ready and one in use.

If I can get use out of this workbook, it will be the first workbook that I've gotten use out of in adulthood.  Creative workbooks strike me as a rare example of a publishing industry product likely to inspire multiple purchases from very satisfied customers, since the people who really enjoy using a creative workbook for one project are likely to enjoy using it again for future projects.  I don't know why my thoughts connected exactly like this, but that was the first thought I had after noticing it to be the first workbook that I've gotten use out of in adulthood: that satisfied customers would buy excellent workbooks repeatedly.  Maybe that's because the *sign* of the thoughts was when I didn't want to use the workbook without finding a way to use it which was in every way right.

In what would be more cost-effective than buying several copies of the workbook, I could also create nodes in my public archive for a setting as described by the suggested exercises in this workbook.  Although I am not presently committing to do any such thing, for that reason I have opened this link in particular.
