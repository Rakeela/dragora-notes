I'm considering making monksfruit-sweetened mung gels as a novel food item.  I've ordered agar powder so they'll be vegan.

I'm not sure why I'm thinking about this right now, but as a kid, I would cry over "what did you do during summer" prompts at school, and I would tell teachers I did, "nothing," but the problem was actually something else.  When I was trying to talk about what I did over summer break, I could and could not think about interacting with my sister Brooke, and I could not think of anything else.  Consciously it was like having my mind blank out.  I wasn't capable of expressing how I really felt and I couldn't consciously figure out what I was stressing about, though I could cry about it.

I believe my teachers thought I was literally crying over inactive summer breaks where nothing happened.

So did I... kind of... but I knew that wasn't right.  My father would take me camping/hunting/fishing, and my mother tried to be fun as well (but she had bad judgment in recreational activities, invariably trusted Brooke to oversee me, and was injuriously bad at camping).  I could've written about that stuff if my mind hadn't always gone to, "I spent half the summer under Brooke's control," then flinched off and shut down conscious processing in favor of crying in class.  It wasn't something that I could think about.

I eventually recovered enough memory to talk about what my summer breaks were *really* like.  Some people who weren't actually being honest to me once accused me of forgetting what made me cry as a child, but the people who made that accusation never managed to *learn* what made me cry as a child.  It was that, and being attacked at school, but they didn't learn that second aspect either; the teachers treated me as a violent troublemaker, which therefore became my authoritative record, though I was a committed pacifist who loved books and longed for school to be a safe place where I could study and learn.

I also cried when asked to write creative material for my classmates.  I didn't want to show them anything.  I didn't trust them at all.  My classmates were violently untrustworthy to me and I didn't want to write stories or poetry for them.  The teachers didn't understand, and neither did I; I said I didn't think it'd be good enough (not the real problem), that I couldn't think of anything (also not the real problem), or that I hated writing and I didn't want to be a writer (which was lying; my private journals were filling with poetry and ideological writings already).

Once, when a teacher asked me to write a poem for an assignment, I wrote it without difficulty.  When it was revealed only after the poems had all been submitted to the teacher that everyone was supposed to read their poem to class, I burst into tears.  I refused to do that and the teacher threatened me with a zero if I didn't submit to reading it aloud.  I couldn't really respond at that point, because I was sobbing.  Eventually the teacher decided to "compromise" by giving me 50% and taking the poem away from me to have someone else read it aloud.  I didn't stop crying until it was handed back to me.  I felt deeply violated.
