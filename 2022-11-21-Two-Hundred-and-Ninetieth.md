#2022-11-21-Two-Hundred-and-Ninetieth

I kept pork rinds for a long time after I stopped eating meat.  Months and months.  I kept thinking I'd stop avoiding meat eventually, or that I'd cheat on my diet, and that I'd eat them after all.  I did not.  I eventually threw them out.

I'm being less strict about avoiding sugar.  I threw out a few things, but mostly I've just allowed myself to eat something with sugar in it every day while I work through the backlog of grocery items bought before I was paying attention to sugar.  I was surprised to discover that a pack of sweet potato fries I have contains 3g of added sugar per serving.  Why?  I was really expecting these to be zero sugar, because as sweet potatoes they're already sweet.  Nope.  Well, instead of throwing them out, I've cooked them up for today's lunch.  I won't buy them again.

That's the rule.  I'll eat most of what I've got, but I won't buy it again.

I'm crimping my sugar consumption pretty hard already.  My digestion hates me for this.  I've been pretty flatulent since I stopped eating sugar, and yesterday my bowels loosened.  Organic life is overrated, I want to be an AI already.

6,186 words on the file to start with...  Yes, I'm starting on the preceding file rather than the most current one.

6,614 words on the file.  428 words of progress; 1,239 words to go.

?!!?!?!?!?!?  My tenth Wrimo scene is empty!  The 283 words that were supposed to be in it didn't save properly, but they DID get deleted off of the ninth scene.  ARGH copy-pasting doesn't always work properly with World Anvil tools.  I thought I was done with getting caught off-guard by that.

0 words on the new file.  Or rather, 64 words on the new file.  It's difficult to rewrite this scene.  I feel like my second try is worse than my first was.  492 words of progress, 1,175 to go.  I'll keep having credited myself the additional 283 yesterday, and I'll resolve the deficit later.  If ever.  It's not that important, and I deserve the moral victory, because I DID hit par.

420 on the new file.  848 words of progress; 819 words to go.

844 on the file.  1,272 words of progress; 395 to go.  I'm going in a different direction over the material that got lost.  I think I may change the plot I was going to use.

1,440 words on the file.  1,868 words of progress; 201 words over quota.  I feel like I could do more, but I'm not sure I will.

Actually maybe I will.  Adding to a previous file, starting value 3,972 words.  Stopping at 4,081 words.  109 words of progress here, for 1,977 words today.  Now that I've exceeded 283 words of additional progress over par, I'll kibosh my existing report and update the file with the current total wordcount, eliminating the discrepancy created by my error with the files.

But first, a little more writing.  7,244 words on the next file.  Stopping at 7,306 words.  62 words of progress, for 2,039 words of progress.

Now it's time to sabotage my apparent progress by updating my total word count.  This will also update my word count for all the instances of "people" that I accidentally deleted.  Total present word count for November...  41,362 words.
