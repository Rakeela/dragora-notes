I've been to two stores for half-price candy day today even though I'm currently fasting.  I celebrate this day more than Halloween.  In the spirit of radical honesty, I've decided to post what I've bought so far.  The QFC nearest me was cleaned out already, but the Bartell's had 'merely' run out of the candy I like most.

Items not candy purchased just now:
1.  Sodastream (Diet caffeine-free cola)
2.  Sodastream (Diet Dr. Pete)
3.  Sodastream (Diet Lemon Lime)
4.  2x Bang Cotton Candy flavor (this and Orange Dreamsicle are the tastiest of the Bang line)

Items candy purchased just now:
1.	Bag of ABBA-ZABA (peanut butter + taffy candy)
	1.	Commentary:  I don't remember what this stuff tastes like, I haven't had it in a long time.
2.	Cougar Mountain Pumpkin Cookie
3.	2x "Franken-cup" green-based Reeses
4.	Coconut Nest
5.	5x Caramel Brownie "Pumpkins"
	1.	Commentary:  One of these had its packaging break open and I couldn't save it, so I only got to add four to my stash.
6.	5x Peanut Butter "Pumpkins"
	1.	Commentary:  These "Pumpkins" are all Russel Stover brand, not Reese's!  ...but Reese's is tastier.
7.	4x Coconut Creme "Pumpkins"

I fast to enjoy food more, and I love candy!  I'm considering going across town to ransack three more grocery stores for half-price candy.  It'd be fun.  Candy keeps for months in theory, so it should be safe to eat and still delicious later on.  That Cougar Mountain cookie won't last for months though, so that's going to be something I eat this Saturday!

I went out on another candy-shopping spree!  This is almost the only day of the year I ever do this, but I like post-Valentines, post-Easter, and post-Christmas for this, too.  BTW, I support sugar taxes!

Items not candy purchased just now:
1. Cinnamon Toast Crunch Chocolate Churros Cereal
2. Hershey's Kisses Cereal
3. Catalina Crunch Maple Waffle Keto Cereal

Items candy purchased just now:
1.  Quaker Chocolate Chip Chewy Halloween Minis
2.  2x Junior Mints Limited Edition Black and Orange Centers
3.  Evolved Pumpkin Spice Coconut Butter Cups
4.  Lily's Mik Chocolate Style Peanut Butter Cups
5.  Zachary Candy Corn Mello Creme
6.  Brach's Classic Candy Corn
7.  Brach's Bello Candy Corn (Banana, Blue Raspberry, and Vanilla Flavored)
8.  16x Butterfinger Miniatures (aka one bag)
9.  Butterfinger Zombie Eyeballs
10.  4x Reese's Peanut Butter "Pumpkins"
11.  2x Russel Stover Sugar Free Peanut Butter Cups (aka one package)
12.  Crunch Monster Eye

I can't eat any of this stuff until the weekend!  Fortunately, I don't fast to spiritually purify myself.  I fast to make food taste better.  Picking this stuff up was great, and eating it will be better for having waited hungrily.

This is one of my favorite holidays!  I was out for hours on my scooter picking up candy.  I visited every grocery store in town for this.

While I'm making fun lists, my three favorite restaurants in my area are:
1. Evergreens Salad
2. Flying Zaucer Pizza
3. Gyo-Kaku Japanese BBQ

I think of Gyo-Kaku as "that really good noodle place," because their garlic noodles are amazing.  I just wish they had a satisfactory vegetarian replacement for the chicken in that dish.  Crispy fried tofu pieces could work, but I'm no chef.  I don't know what it would really take to vegetarianize that dish.

My current naked weight is 222.5 pounds, which is 101 kilograms.  I drink a lot of water, so my water weight should be high.  Fasting is a way to lose weight for me.  I've lost a lot of weight this way, and I would like to be under 200 pounds someday.

Recording my weighings and what I eat on the weekend should help.  The people who raped my privacy when I stopped putting out for "liberal" observers have been tracking my food consumption anyways.  They keep expecting that I lie.  I'm pretty sure that the people who raped my privacy when I stopped being sexually entertaining decided I was a conservative infiltrator, but I'm not.  I just pulled back.  I wanted my boundaries to be respected.  The fundamental unit of liberal sexuality is the right to say "No," and my right to say no wasn't respected when I needed it.

One last bit of eating lore for the patient reader.  Cannibal feasts are a form of virtue signalling.  They prove that people can think evil thoughts without committing crimes.  That shows the rejection of thoughtcrime enforcement.
