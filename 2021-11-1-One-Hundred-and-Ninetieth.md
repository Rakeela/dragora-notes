I've been to two stores for half-price candy day today even though I'm currently fasting.  I celebrate this day more than Halloween.  In the spirit of radical honesty, I've decided to post what I've bought so far.  The QFC nearest me was cleaned out already, but the Bartell's had 'merely' run out of the candy I like most.

Items not candy purchased just now:
1.  Sodastream (Diet caffeine-free cola)
2.  Sodastream (Diet Dr. Pete)
3.  Sodastream (Diet Lemon Lime)
4.  2x Bang Cotton Candy flavor (this and Orange Dreamsicle are the tastiest of the Bang line)

Items candy purchased just now:
1.	Bag of ABBA-ZABA (peanut butter + taffy candy)
	1.	Commentary:  I don't remember what this stuff tastes like, I haven't had it in a long time.
2.	Cougar Mountain Pumpkin Cookie
3.	2x "Franken-cup" green-based Reeses
4.	Coconut Nest
5.	5x Caramel Brownie "Pumpkins"
	1.	Commentary:  One of these had its packaging break open and I couldn't save it, so I only got to add four to my stash.
6.	5x Peanut Butter "Pumpkins"
	1.	Commentary:  These "Pumpkins" are all Russel Stover brand, not Reese's!  ...but Reese's is tastier.
7.	4x Coconut Creme "Pumpkins"

I fast to enjoy food more, and I love candy!  I'm considering going across town to ransack three more grocery stores for half-price candy.  It'd be fun.  Candy keeps for months in theory, so it should be safe to eat and still delicious later on.

I went out on another candy-shopping spree!  This is almost the only day of the year I ever do this, but I like post-Valentines, post-Easter, and post-Christmas for this, too.  BTW, I support sugar taxes!

Items not candy purchased just now:
1. Cinnamon Toast Crunch Chocolate Churros Cereal
2. Hershey's Kisses Cereal
3. Catalina Crunch Maple Waffle Keto Cereal

Items candy purchased just now:
1.  Quaker Chocolate Chip Chewy Halloween Minis
2.  2x Junior Mints Limited Edition Black and Orange Centers
3.  Evolved Pumpkin Spice Coconut Butter Cups
4.  Lily's Mik Chocolate Style Peanut Butter Cups
5.  Zachary Candy Corn Mello Creme
6.  Brach's Classic Candy Corn
7.  Brach's Bello Candy Corn (Banana, Blue Raspberry, and Vanilla Flavored)
8.  16x Butterfinger Miniatures (aka one bag)
9.  Butterfinger Zombie Eyeballs
10.  4x Reese's Peanut Butter "Pumpkins"
11.  2x Russel Stover Sugar Free Peanut Butter Cups (aka one package)
12.  Crunch Monster Eye

I can't eat any of this stuff until the weekend!  Fortunately, I don't fast to spiritually purify myself.  I fast to make food taste better.  Picking this stuff up was great, and eating it will be better for having waited hungrily.

This is one of my favorite holidays!  I was out for hours on my scooter picking up candy.  I visited every grocery store in town for this.
