I've been to two stores for half-price candy day today even though I'm currently fasting.  I celebrate this day more than Halloween.  In the spirit of radical honesty, I've decided to post what I've bought so far.  The QFC nearest me was cleaned out already, but the Bartell's had 'merely' run out of the candy I like most.

Items not candy purchased just now:
1.  Sodastream (Diet caffeine-free cola)
2.  Sodastream (Diet Dr. Pete)
3.  Sodastream (Diet Lemon Lime)
4.  2x Bang Cotton Candy flavor (this and Orange Dreamsicle are the tastiest of the Bang line)

Items candy purchased just now:
1.	Bag of ABBA-ZABA (peanut butter + taffy candy)
	1.	Commentary:  I don't remember what this stuff tastes like, I haven't had it in a long time.
2.	Cougar Mountain Pumpkin Cookie
3.	2x "Franken-cup" green-based Reeses
4.	Coconut Nest
5.	5x Caramel Brownie "Pumpkins"
	1.	Commentary:  One of these had its packaging break open and I couldn't save it, so I only got to add four to my stash.
6.	5x Peanut Butter "Pumpkins"
	1.	Commentary:  These "Pumpkins" are all Russel Stover brand, not Reese's!  ...but Reese's is tastier.
7.	4x Coconut Creme "Pumpkins"

I fast to enjoy food more, and I love candy!  I'm considering going across town to ransack three more grocery stores for half-price candy.  It'd be fun.  Candy keeps for months in theory, so it should be safe to eat and still delicious later on.
