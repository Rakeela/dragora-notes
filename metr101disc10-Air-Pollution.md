# Metr101disc10 Air Pollution

I'm getting an earlier start on this one than I usually do.

This discussion reads more like an assignment which takes inputs in the form of essays than it reads like an essay prompt.

(Instructions as Follows)
**_Question #1:_** Describe 2 (two) different ways that air pollution could directly impact your life now or in the future. (i.e., hobbies, leisure, travel, food, health, etc.) 

**_Question #2:_** How do you think air pollution may change in the future? (You can choose to think locally in your city, in the United States, in another country, or globally) 

**_Question #3:_** In your opinion, do you think air pollution worldwide will improve and get better in the next 20-50 years? Explain your answer. 

**_Question #4:_** Please write 1-2 questions you still have from concepts covered in Modules 7-10. If you do not have any questions, please write 1 test question on any topics covered over the last few weeks. Please include the correct answer in your post!

Thinking of this as four essay questions instead of one essay prompt, I suppose I should draft four small replies instead of one larger reply.

Question 1

I need to pull this in to the small and personal.  Significant wildfires, for instance, are something which has in the past directly impacted my life.
