# Metr101disc10 Air Pollution

I'm getting an earlier start on this one than I usually do.

This discussion reads more like an assignment which takes inputs in the form of essays than it reads like an essay prompt.

(Instructions as Follows)
**_Question #1:_** Describe 2 (two) different ways that air pollution could directly impact your life now or in the future. (i.e., hobbies, leisure, travel, food, health, etc.) 

**_Question #2:_** How do you think air pollution may change in the future? (You can choose to think locally in your city, in the United States, in another country, or globally) 

**_Question #3:_** In your opinion, do you think air pollution worldwide will improve and get better in the next 20-50 years? Explain your answer. 

**_Question #4:_** Please write 1-2 questions you still have from concepts covered in Modules 7-10. If you do not have any questions, please write 1 test question on any topics covered over the last few weeks. Please include the correct answer in your post!

Thinking of this as four essay questions instead of one essay prompt, I suppose I should draft four small replies instead of one larger reply.

Question 1

I need to pull this in to the small and personal.  Significant wildfires, for instance, are something which has in the past directly impacted my life.

The mention of 'food' in the prompt is interesting.  How does air pollution affect food?  The four-questions presentation makes me reluctant to research this.

I know that air pollution dampened my appreciation of the area where I grew up.  The forests were beautiful, but when all the air had the Staley's Stench, I wasn't impressed by assurances that the pollution in the air was produced by food processing facilities producing harmless volatiles, and was therefore safe to breathe.  I found that hard to believe.  Worse, it wasn't fun.  The industrial funk hanging in the air made an oppressive environment worse.  Fortunately, that environment will never bother me again.  Unfortunately, I can't use it for this essay.

Health impacts are morbid and nigh-helpless to think about.  Activists need a strong foundation of empowerment to take on something as fundamental as the weather itself, and that's about the intuitive (though not actual) difficulty of solving pollution in an area.  We don't really have the foundation of recreational ubiquitous sensors needed to take this on.

Wait, recreational ubiquitous sensors?  That sounds like something I wish I could be capable of, passively.  Imagine having local omniscience implants via connection to a local sensor grid!  It might take preprocessing the accumulated data model in order to present a truly intuitive user experience, since I don't think I'd want to load my visual processing systems with a bunch of different sensor inputs simultaneously...  I wish I could use this, but it's just a fantasy about something that I consider a probable future technology.  I don't know enough to begin to guess at what kind of time horizon such a product would exist on from the present day.

Sensors are a hard technology to distribute, much to my dissatisfaction.  My grandmothers' houses had nearly-comparable meteorological equipment to my current house, despite being of older, simpler designs.  Pushing too hard into ubiquitous private sensor ownership would create an "everything is transparent" problem.  People would probably be evil to each other with such equipment, too.  I no longer think mass private distribution of sensors is wise, but that leaves me wishing mass public distribution of sensors were launched instead.  Humanity could theoretically implement the heavily sensored mesh network from Eclipse Phase with its current tech level, as that technology is not dependent on exotic nanotech or biotech advances.

What does this have to do with air pollution?  Well, it's a form of bad weather, isn't it?  We need to be able to see it.  Hm...  I still don't think I can make any immediate use of this.  In expressing a desire for sensors, I'm expressing an ignorance of the true nature of the problem, which is fine save that my actual ignorance of the problem is such that I also know very little about what sensors would be useful.  How much automated air pollution scanning equipment could reasonably be constructed for adding to new public sensor meshes, and with what resolution would they work?

...drat it, but I have just linked it right back to biotech.  More than for its health effects, I dream of working with [[xenomitochondria]] so that I can achieve metabolic acceleration factors for essential plantlife.  In this case, since carbon scrubbers are based on algae, [[transgenic-algae]] may be helpful in maximizing their CO2 absorption.

I'm thinking about the rooftop scrubber-garden concept that I described in [[envs100disc9-airpollution]], and its companion worked into HVAC systems.  If those are dramatically superior to natural trees as air scrubbers, I don't think the architecture that I proposed is all that improbable.  I'm imagining these as platforms built in sleek green and white, more abstract sculpture than imitation plantlife; thoroughly unnatural, but evoking the cleansing green by their colors and icons.

Fundamentally, I believe in human industry.  I think it's absurd to think that a society which works so much metal every day can be defeated by problems it could solve by working metal differently.  I'm... not really an environmentalist, but the stuff I think is neat also gets affected by the climate.  So can I write about how I think air pollution is going to change the look of cities?  ...maybe for Question #2.

Admittedly, people aren't usually keen on adopting massive new architectural investments.  Eh...  it'd be kind of sad if "conservative architecture" was the social force that killed humanity...  I hope that's not the great filter itself.  Do societies that are overextending their resource base tend to get tied into the design patterns which animate their most massive investments, creating a well of change-resistance which destroys civilizations?  I find that disconcertingly easy to imagine, but that's more in the category of [[existential-threat]].  I can't use that here.

Hah!  The most straightforward way air pollution is going to affect my life going forward is that I'm going to keep thinking about it!

(Draft)
My husband doesn't like to travel, and I'm not a very outgoing person, so the most prominent way that air pollution is likely to affect my life seems to be that wildfire season may put up a haze.  Perhaps a larger way air pollution would impact my life is that I'm fixated on biotechnology, and I tend in various to think of the atmosphere as a kind of bio-engineering challenge.  Could a new transgenic algae with a faster metabolism make pollution control installations more cost-effective?

Question 2

(Draft)
I think that the fate of the climate is going to be similar to the fate of air pollution control issues more generally, and that environmentalism will win both battles or neither.  The primary battleground over environmentalism will be in the deeply impoverished parts of the world.  I suspect that eco-intransigence in the developing world stems from a frustration with the failure of the first world to put its industrialism where its mouth is by producing cheap green utility exports.  If America had reacted to environmentalism the way it reacted to automobiles (think about just how massive the highway system is), we'd have made much more drastic progress, but our nation appears to have insisted on a high-cost image-obsessed 'bespoke' environmentalism rather than engaging in industrial retooling for low-cost mass production of eco-friendly technologies.
