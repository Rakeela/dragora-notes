# Metr101disc10 Air Pollution

I'm getting an earlier start on this one than I usually do.

This discussion reads more like an assignment which takes inputs in the form of essays than it reads like an essay prompt.

(Instructions as Follows)
**_Question #1:_** Describe 2 (two) different ways that air pollution could directly impact your life now or in the future. (i.e., hobbies, leisure, travel, food, health, etc.) 

**_Question #2:_** How do you think air pollution may change in the future? (You can choose to think locally in your city, in the United States, in another country, or globally) 

**_Question #3:_** In your opinion, do you think air pollution worldwide will improve and get better in the next 20-50 years? Explain your answer. 

**_Question #4:_** Please write 1-2 questions you still have from concepts covered in Modules 7-10. If you do not have any questions, please write 1 test question on any topics covered over the last few weeks. Please include the correct answer in your post!

Thinking of this as four essay questions instead of one essay prompt, I suppose I should draft four small replies instead of one larger reply.

Question 1

I need to pull this in to the small and personal.  Significant wildfires, for instance, are something which has in the past directly impacted my life.

The mention of 'food' in the prompt is interesting.  How does air pollution affect food?  The four-questions presentation makes me reluctant to research this.

I know that air pollution dampened my appreciation of the area where I grew up.  The forests were beautiful, but when all the air had the Staley's Stench, I wasn't impressed by assurances that the pollution in the air was produced by food processing facilities producing harmless volatiles, and was therefore safe to breathe.  I found that hard to believe.  Worse, it wasn't fun.  The industrial funk hanging in the air made an oppressive environment worse.  Fortunately, that environment will never bother me again.  Unfortunately, I can't use it for this essay.
