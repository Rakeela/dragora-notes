14.5 Chiral Molecules

An object whose mirror image is identical to the original and can be superimposed on it is achiral.  Objects such as hands that have nonsuperimposable mirror images are chiral.

Molecules are structural isomers when they have the same molecular formula but different bonding arrangements.  (The example is given of C2H6O which can be Ethanol or Dimethyl Ether.) (The example is given of C3H6O which can be Propanal or Propanone.)  In stereoisomers, the atoms are bonded in the same sequence, but differ in the way they are arranged in space.

Left and right hands are chiral because they have mirror images that cannot be superimposed on each other.  When the mirror images cannot be completely matched, they are nonsuperimposable.

(A series of images are given as examples.  Gloves and shoes are chiral.  Bats and glasses are achiral.)

Carbon atoms are chiral if they are bonded to four different atoms or groups.  When stereoisomers cannot be superimposed, they are called enantiomers.

If a molecule with two or more identical atoms bonded to the same atom is rotated, the atoms can be superimposed and the mirror images represent the same structure.

A Fischer projection is a two-dimensional representation of a molecule.  It places the most oxidized group at the top.  It uses vertical lines for bonds that go backwards and horizontal lines for bonds that go forward.  The intersections of vertical and horizontal lines represent a carbon atom that is usually chiral.

For glyceraldehyde, the only chiral carbon is the middle carbon.  In the Fischer projection, the carbonyl group, which is the most oxidized group, is drawn at the top.  (The example is given of L-Glyceralderhyde and D-Glyceraldehyde.)

Fischer projections can also be drawn for compounds that have two or more chiral carbons.  In the mirror image of erythrose, both of the carbon atoms at the intersections are chiral.  The mirror image for L-erythrose is drawn by reversing the positions of all the -H and -OH groups on the horizontal lines of D-erythrose.  (The example is given of L-Erythrose and D-Erythrose.)

The designation as a D or an L stereoisomer of a Fischer projection is determined by the position of the -OH group attached to the chiral carbon farthest from the carbonyl group.  (Commentary:  An OH group on the left will be L, on the right will be D.)  (Commentary:  In the absence of an -OH group, such as chiral amines, look to the position of the amine.)

Molecules in nature also have mirror images, and often one stereoisomer has a diffferent biological effect than the other one.  One enantiomer of Carvone, produced by the spearmint plant, smells and tastes like spearmint, whereas its mirror image, produced by the caraway plant, has the odor and taste of caraway in rye bread.  Our senses of smell and taste are responsive to the chirality of molecules.

(An example slide is given to illustrating L-Carvone and D-Carvone.)  (Teacher's commentary: The chiral carbon in the Carvone example is illustrated by a star.)

A substance used to treat Parkinson's disease is L-dopa, which is converted to dopamine in the brain, where it raises the serotonin level.  The D-dopa enantiomer is not effective for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.  (The example is given of L-Dopa and RD-Dopa.  As before, a chiral carbon is marked by a star.)
