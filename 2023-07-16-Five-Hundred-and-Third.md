5:53.  I was awake and out of bed at 5:25.  I just got around to marking my first time point.  I'm reading Pridelord.

5:57.  Analytical reading is considerably harder than recreational reading.  I'm having to evaluate the text as I go, asking, "Does this part work?"

8:32.  I must've eaten a few more of these Lily's sugar-free chocolate bars than I had recorded, because I'm down to my last one.

8:51.  Every so rarely - very rarely - the world seems to wobble like I imagine an earthquake would feel.  I think I've literally felt a few earthquakes.  One of those wobbles just happened.  I don't know if there was a literal earthquake or not.  It was very mild.  Just a single jolt underfoot.]

15:34.  71,509.  71,811.

15:46.  71,966.  457 words of progress.

16:20.  72,215.  706 words of progress.  Halfway!  I want to get back to reading Pridelord, so I may opt to make today a quota day on purpose.

17:32.  72,721.  1,212 words of progress.

17:34.  24,901/10.5 = 237.

17:57.  72,912.  1,403 words of progress.

18:08.  I read someone on Telegram talking about the two kinds of Christians.  The "love one another" Christian and the "burn in Hell" Christian.  They also described that they have to be afraid to be too affectionate in public to their boyfriend because some Christian might have so much "love" in their system that they attack them.

18:11.  I've got a book that I'm reading - Living Tao by Ilchi Lee - which frustrates me because it assigns materialists as all evil.  It assumes that people can't have meaningful lives if they don't have spiritual lives.  It assumes that empathy is a spiritual trait.

20:40.  Did some more Pridelord reading, that was very fun even with the added burden of taking notes.  Did two pages more Living Tao reading, and I wanted to roll my eyes again.  It conflates love and possessiveness.  Possessiveness is loveless!

20:47.  This Living Tao book claims that most of the diseases affecting modern people are psychosomatic.  Argh.

20:52.  This is another book that demonizes individualism.  People who don't have empathy for individualists don't have empathy, period.  All experience is individual experience.  That is the foundational condition of life on Earth.  In a properly structured society, the pursuit of the well-being of the collective IS the pursuit of the well-being of the individual, and the contradiction between the two arises from a failure to be empathetic to individuals.

20:56.  This author speaks frankly of hallucinating in childhood.  Regularly.  I experienced a few oddities in childhood as well, but not like this.

21:00.  Ow.  I stood, and my legs barely held me.  I felt this earlier, and I thought I'd walked too much, so I switched to sitting.  Now I have been sitting for hours, and I still feel this way.  Hours of walking and hours of sitting have something in common.

21:22.  All excessive concern for fasting is corrupt.  Concern that fasts are kept is corrupt; concern that fasts are broken is corrupt.  Inducing people to fast is corrupt; inducing people to break fast is corrupt.  Medical concerns alone can justify a fast.  Medical supervisors alone have the right to judge the maintenance of a fast.
