#Godzilla-vs-Biollante-1989

Date First Watched:  2022-05-10
Dates Rewatched:  Never

This is the movie that inspired my [[Movies-Watched]] category!  I realized that I wanted to remember it better than I remembered [[The-Return-of-Godzilla-1984]] and as a result I ended up two-timing another movie again while recording every movie I could remember having ever watched.  This is the first movie to have ever had its Date First Watched field filled in!  From here on out, I plan to record every movie that I watch when I watch it.

As for the movie itself...  The Hesei continuity really committed to their worldbuilding.  I respect that.  They took this impossible monster and started building an impossible biology based on it, with humanity not so helpless in this continuity as they built super-weapons to try to keep up with and control the threat of Godzilla.

I could tell early on that I could look forward to someday rewatching this movie, because I was already enjoying it even as I continued working on my list of movies.
