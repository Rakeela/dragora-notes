# Difficulty of Self-Monitoring

It's very difficult to commit to accumulating counts about myself.  By accumulating counts, I refer to the kind of performance-tracking data commonly available in videogames to help the player optimize their performance.  I understand the function of such counts in helping players improve their performance in games.  The difficulty I have with creating such counts is partially emotional and partially literal.  To the extent that it is an emotional difficulty, it is also difficult to use available tools to accumulate counts.  To the extent that it is a literal difficulty, the availability of tools is greatly prized.

I don't know what principle differentiates the fraction of emotional vs literal difficulty.  My only conscious interface with this structure appears to be the discovery of this as predominantly literal difficulty, which discovery is made when an attempt to use an available tool proves relieving and useful rather than frustrating and dispiriting.  I would predict that, at least in my own case, as tools of self-observation become more powerful and easier to use, more of these challenges will be "discovered" to have been predominantly literal difficulties, and as a causality for this I would propose that powerful, easy to use tools are themselves a kind of emotional asset which tends to overcome any emotional deficit which could have existed to their deployment.  It is important to note therefore that developing mechanisms for the observation of emotionally difficult counts is not necessarily wrong, but it's important that it be done tactfully and well so that the tool will more surely achieve its fullest potential.

I'm considering listing things as they are discovered, here.

Self-monitoring tools discovered to have been difficult to utilize primarily due to literal difficulty:
1)  Fasting time
    I was born overweight, and I've never not been overweight.  I've done some fairly alarming calorie counting experiments, and I've discovered that my body seems to be brutally unwilling to yield up stored resources; I don't start shedding fat until I'm eating under a thousand calories a day.  Trying to count calories has been stressful every time I have attempted it, so I can't say that I have (yet) found that calorie-counting is of predominantly literal difficulty.  This challenge existing, I pushed past 'calorie counting' and into the territory of 'no'.  For some unknown psychological reason, eating nothing appears to stress me out less than making my food budget count to a thousand every day.  Very nearly the only way in which I have ever lost weight is by fasting.  The problem is that I'm not good at fasting.  It's really hard.  I've struggled to tally up how much time I spend fasting.  I've recently discovered that this was primarily a literal difficulty, as I now have access to a fasting tracking app which gives me to-the-second counts of how long I have been fasting and how long I plan to continue.
