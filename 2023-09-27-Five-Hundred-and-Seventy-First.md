7:17.  I have woken up, finished my morning stuff, and I'm getting to work promptly this time!  51,719.

9:54.  I got distracted doing social media stuff.  In theory, this should contribute to my long-term popularity?  But in practice, it's pretty hard to advance.  I'm not good at being sociable.

10:04.  51,793.

10:09.  I'm still kinda distracted by social media.  I don't know how to get followers.

10:26.  I'm distracted in part because I have no ideas for my writing right now.  I'm thinking about something... but I can't clock 'thinking time' very well.  My subconscious is chewing over an issue to try to give me a solution.  I don't even know how to consciously approach the necessary problem-solving.

11:45.  2,100 words on the chapter.  53,211.  1,492 words of progress.  To celebrate making quota, I'm going to go play Starfield.

14:46.  I am back!

15:19.  I have been 'back' for a while, but I haven't gotten back to work.  Hum.  I am not focused at all.  I am really feeling that shot of whiskey that I drank.  Strange.  The whiskey is labeled as slightly less alcoholic than the gin I have been used to, and yet a shot of whiskey is affecting me more than a shot of gin had been affecting me

15:27.  I ate too much while on break from fasting.  Partially I was motivated by the fear that my gut isn't working.  This erratic eating schedule mostly stops my bowel movements, which scares me.  So I not only ate heavily to try to get my bowels moving again, I finished off my eating with a bar of sugar-free chocolate to provide additional agitation to my gut.
