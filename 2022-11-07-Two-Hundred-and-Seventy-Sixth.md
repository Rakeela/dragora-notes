Chemistry class is really passing by quickly today.  I could stand to have more of this.  Today, I like class.  I'm not sure what's different.  Maybe it's that I got a break from mental health issues yesterday.  I had a ton of candy, and notwithstanding my agonizing over Nanowrimo, I was pretty happy.

Oh, right.  I have to spend another hour here.  Suddenly I'm less excited.

Ugh, I don't have the polyatomic ions memorized.  This next test may be brutal.  The -ate and -ite distinction is kind of painful.  SO4 is sulfate and SO3 is sulfite, for example.  Yet ClO2 is chlorite and ClO3 is chlorate, with ClO4 being *per*chlorate.  I'm confused as to how ClO, ClO2, ClO3, and ClO4 all have the same charge, too.

This is kind of "chem notes", but I'm also editorializing.  Maybe it'll help me do better in the future.

Today might be the day I fail to reach my Nanowrimo quota.  I'm starting on a file with 2,892 words in it...  No, I'll just start a new file.  I'm starting at 0 this time.  It'll be really easy to gauge how far along I am.  27 words as of this writing.
