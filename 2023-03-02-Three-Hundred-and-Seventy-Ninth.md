I ate a falafel wrap in the middle of the night, hours before the morning weigh-in.

I set up Galciv 4 so I could play it while using my treadmill, and then I played it for some two hours and change.  Eventually, the timeburn got to me.  I feel like I'm no good at the game, but moreover I don't feel like I gain anything by playing it.  It can't contribute to my longer-term objectives.  It's not like I want to write Galciv fanfic, so it's not like I can turn it into writing practice.

I do like the new multisector mechanics.  It's no longer possible to dominate the galaxy from a pocket of ultra-culture, because cultural borders now stop at the edge of sector maps.  I haven't figured out how to do cultural conquest yet.  I'm tempted to load it up again and this time be merciless against the Iconians in my own sector.  I've got them fairly kettled up and they're being pushed out by my influence.  I could probably just push them out entirely.  But, again, I wouldn't get anything for culturally extinguishing fictional Iconians...

I'm trying to raise my walking speed to 2.3 mph and it's not being effective.  I've been tiring quickly at this pace.  It takes a lot of my focus.

Either I'm specifically fatigued today (possible), or going over 2.1 mph will require more training than I've completed.  2.1 mph is the record I've achieved so far for how fast I can walk while fully distracting myself with my computer.

I want to eat more, but besides the impact on my diet, I'm well-aware that it would only make me feel worse.  Instead, I'll go hit up the library.  Maybe I'll read while I'm there.  I'll bring my Freewrite.  Maybe I'll get some writing done.  Just in case...  1,205 on the file.

Tch.  I didn't make it to the library.  The rain convinced me to stop early.  I wrote briefly at a local eatery, and then decided (even though I didn't have the spare calories) to eat a salad from the place.  My decision was heavily informed by the presence of red velvet cookies at the eatery.  I don't eat a lot of red velvet cookies.  I look forward to eating that cookie I bought *tomorrow*.

On the plus side, I looked briefly at my writing, and about forty words later I'd fixed a problem that had been demoralizing me.  Now I have something to think about that isn't awful.

I stared at the eatery's menu trying to find a salad item that didn't include meat, and I thought I'd spotted one... but it turned out that I'd misread the menu.  It still had meat on it.  So I had them remake it without meat.  I would've been fine picking the meat off... when I pointed out the meat, the man behind the counter immediately started remaking it without asking me if I wanted him to.  I didn't stop him.  Honestly, that's quite polite.  I should've given him a tip for being polite, but at the moment the tip question showed up on the electronic device through which I paid, I thought, "This is already pretty pricey for a half-sized salad."

I've managed a good stretch on the treadmill at 2.3 mph, and unfortunately the treadmill has started to rattle.

---
1,566 words on the file.  361 words of progress.  I'm stopping.  My momentum isn't carrying me into the solution to the problem that I need for the next 1k words.  Let's play some more Galciv.

17.0 miles, 2,509 kcal, 50,029 steps, 9 hours and 1 second, average speed 1.9 mph.  That's my record on all counts.  I even used it at 3 mph for a while.  Maximum recommended daily usage is 9 hours, so...

I gotta use this thing at 3 mph for most of 9 hours in order to complete a marathon in under 9 hours.  Good god.  Can I get that good?  I'm not sure.

I drank half a glass of rehydration solution, even though that technically adds a few sugar calories to my day.  Should be healthy.
