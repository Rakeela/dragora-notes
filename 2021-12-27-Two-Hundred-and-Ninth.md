I've discovered another delicious flavor combination.  Orange soda mixes well with Torani belgian cookie flavoring.  This may be another Black Rose candidate... if I am EVER capable of being organized enough to found a business!

The orange base is considerably underapplied in soda.  Black Rose would be a diet orange soda specialist company.  Orange chocolate is 'stock' and it excites people without being too unfamiliar...  Orange cookie is much more novel and would attract people interested in trying something peculiar on the promise of its founder.  All the black rose stuff is novelty-dependent; I think the orange chocolate formula will addict people.

I think I could really make this kind of thing work!  Mostly because I'd be making soda for my own tastes, and so the formula would be good once it was releasable.

Meanwhile, I want to find a pizzeria that will sell me savory strawberry cheese & spinach pizzas.

Here's another business idea that I thought of, and I'd not be sad if someone stole it from me: heated arch supports for shoes.  Imagine if people had inserts they could put in their shoes that would provide a gentle warmth while making their step more comfortable!  It'd sell.
