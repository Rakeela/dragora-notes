So...  Now I've got a specific experiment concept up, roughly described.  That's over at [[Universal-tolerogenic-dendritic-cell-experiment-1]].  I kind of feel like I'm in a "now what" stage.  I'm almost confident that I should keep studying this and producing testable hypotheses?  I'm *not quite* confident that I should keep studying this and producing testable hypotheses.  I feel like other hypotheses are going to be somehow worse than this one.

Also, I feel like my other ideas are sort of dwindling into ninja-space as I've gotten caught imagining my efforts as being about cloaking from the immune system.  Which isn't *worthless* or anything, but it is a bit disquieting.  Should I try to clear the cellular surface of other identifying signatures and then induce the formation of custom receptors that only anergize the immune system?  Should I try to make cells that surround themselves with a brew of 'I'm harmless' chemicals while hunting down mistrained T cells?  Ninja cells!

Last night in bed, Kistaro likened the immune system to a medichine swarm.  "Nature already made nanites," zie said.  It's such an amazing concept.  Molecular biology puts me closer to working on nanotechnology than I thought, and it's exciting.  I didn't know that was in the range of my potential.

Really, ideally, humanity needs some kind of consciously-guided interface for the immune system.  I don't know if making *that* is in my potential.  Life extension would be easier if it were possible to tell the immune system that it should go after such-and-such antigen, and it shouldn't go after this-the-other antigen.  For now though, producing any kind of injectable retraining impetus for the immune system would be great.

There's a cancer research internship open at a local research center.  I want to sign up for it, but Kistaro discouraged me, citing health risks.  So I won't!  Not until we're vaccinated.  Yet I'm very disappointed if I have to miss it, because the internship program says that they help interns complete a research project.  Which is...  I want to go!  It reads like a potential opportunity to get my work tested and published way earlier than I thought I could.  It reads like labwork opportunities with expert assistance to me.

Even though I'm focused on the ways that the immune system interacts with mental illness, aging, and arthritis, I also understand the connection between the work I want to do and cancer treatment.  The immune system is supposed to take down cancers.  Sometimes that works, but sometimes it ends up guarding them.  Tregs around a tumor are a bad sign.  Being able to retune the immune system would result in considerable advances in low-morbidity cancer treatment.
