I'm starting on my next phase of trying to seriously consume Huel.  I've started my day with some coffee caramel Huel.  It's their caramel variety with instant coffee mixed in; it's one of the tastiest, but it's not decaf.  I was still hungry, so I've mixed a second shake of peanut butter with some gingerbread flavoring added in.  Gingerbread works okay, but the result is a pretty muddy flavoring.  It's hard to get a pure flavor in anything Huel.

Even though I'm starting a new diet phase, I'm also already planning to break my conduct day 1 here, because I've got some mung bean cakes en route for delivery.  Those were shipped here from Vietnam!  Reviews on them suggest that they're tasty if they're not totally old, but they're prone to age-related degradation.  To give the shipped products the best chance to shine, I'm going to try some of the cake from each of the two packages that I bought.  It's mung bean; I doubt I'm doing any great disservice to my health by eating some of it.

I hear crows.  Categorically.  I hear crows when I shouldn't hear crows.

I hear a number of things that I shouldn't.  For instance, if I cut all sound sources and listen only to myself, I hear a steady constant whine that has been part of my experience for as long as I can remember, and which has therefore become comforting.  I also hear a patterned beeping noise which at this rate looks like it's going to be comfortable eventually, but which is so far still annoying to listen to.

When I listen to fans, HVAC systems, complex windy environments, and other similar things, I hear beeps from wind vortices.  These are something objective; I can trace them.  I try to eliminate them when I can.  I've nothing against complex wind patterns per se, but because I hear them as beeping, they annoy me.  Fans have characteristic beeps from the way they slice the air.  I don't want to hear this, but ever since I started hearing it, I can't turn it off.  It bothers me less than it bothered me before I figured out what I was hearing.

Kistaro says that this sound hypersensitivity is probably PTSD-linked hypervigilance.  Zie described that people who are trying very hard to train themselves to hear sound cues start to hear more and more of the garbage data transiting their audio processing system.  As with the visual processing subsystem, there are filtering layers on the sound cues based on expectations which can result in overmatching to expectations, and the brain's pattern matching system may overmatch patterns we'd rather it had the ability to unlearn.

Zie blames zirself for inducing this experience by encouraging me to speak at lower volumes.  I think that's a sorrow which zie shouldn't apologize for.  When we first moved in together, I was persistently *too loud*, vocally.  I think zie's taking on too much self-blame here; I didn't intend to be speaking in a borderline yell all the time, and I didn't want to be.  That was a bad habit picked up from one of the things that was objectively wrong with my childhood.

There's no mystery to me what detail of my early life went wrong to create that issue.  I love my dad, but I can admit that even when he was being smart and gentle, his raw volume still tended to be borderline yelling.  He did a non-zero amount of real yelling too if he got upset, and his persona around his dumbass friends was kind of always yelling.  He had too much voice.  (Can you imagine someone who is consistently louder than is appropriate for whatever they're trying to say?)  Kistaro successfully discouraged me from talking like that, and I'm grateful, even if zie thinks zie may have oversensitized me to sound levels in the process.

I mentioned crows, though. The crow sounds that I hear aren't as nonsensical as beeping.  I hear crow-nemes (portmanteau of 'crow' and 'phoneme'); I hear units of crow speech.  Worse, I hear them in appropriate contexts, like I'm hearing voices... but the voices belong to crows.  Kistaro said that people who are learning a new language sometimes experience this kind of thing, and thinks that I'm starting to *think* in the local crow dialect, where it applies.  I think it's possible.  I'm not totally thrilled by the thought.

Crows have a surprising number of words and inflections that I've picked out.  I can't replicate any of them, but I can hear it.  When the crows in the area are talking about local aerial predators, I usually understand them.  When they're talking about the weather, sometimes I understand them; the first weather report I get all day sometimes comes from a crow.  I don't know their food calls; Kistaro thinks zie knows more about the food calls than I do.  They also have affectionate calls, encouragements, rejections, and even the ability to express amusement.

That's all very unusual and interesting to me, but it's not practical.  I have no use for thinking in crow.  Worse, I wouldn't even be thinking in some universal crow language.  The crows in Seattle speak weird foreign Seattlese with all the inflections wrong.  It's like picking up the language of a small, primitive tribe.  The only thing they talk about that I have a real interest in is the weather, though it's fun to walk into an area with crows in the trees and have them call out at me.

Kistaro reassured me of one other thing that I think is worth recording.  It's not credible that any technological method could be used to induce the crow calls that I hear in my thoughts.  I'm not the first person to ever discover that crows are a useful source of intel, but most of the people who've ever advanced this particular skill were hunters for primitive tribes, who were nearer the concerns of the crows in many ways and could sometimes hunt collaboratively to the benefit of all concerned.  Furthermore, each particular dialect of crow belongs to a sufficiently small range of crows, that I am probably the only person on Earth who has that skill for *this exact crow population*.  Nobody else would have my very particular associations with the way the local crows are inflecting their crow-nemes for communication.

I believe some of the weird things I've went through had material external causes, but this one either comes down to spiritual causes, or else it's all me.  Although I appreciate the spiritual explanation (perhaps I'm hearing the spirits of friendly crows who had steady access to peanuts thanks to me), I'm scientifically obligated to say that hearing crow is all me this time.

What a useless skill.  I guess it's very fitting for me.  I consider crows sapience candidates, and I'd like to uplift them.  When I think about the technical overseers and the thinking dust technologies in [[The-Viceroy]], I think of my longing to uplift crows...  If we had that kind of sharing technology...

I'm still thinking about something I thought about yesterday.  Why do we say that irrigation salinizes fields by causing salt deposition?  That is not specific enough to represent the complete relevant understanding.  Irrigation water can only deposit salt via evaporation to the extent that it contains salt.  The water I use in my CPAP machine at night would not salt a field were it used as an irrigant, because I use distilled water for that.  Why can't we use irrigation water for controlled deposition of all manner of chemical substances?  The chemical content of farm soils could be very substantially altered were water-soluble chemistry up to the task of providing for the necessary alterant compounds.  It may even be possible to desalt a field by planning for ongoing cycling of the water to maintain its chemobalance, using a low salt water input, and then filtering salt out of the cycled water.

I wonder if I'll ever get to have a hydroponic garden on Mars.  Hm.  Hey, how many more people would be more willing to migrate to Mars if personal hydroponics were available as a cheap luxury add-on?  I'm not exactly the only peaceful person on Earth who likes plants.  It might be a useful source of biomass for a colony that's likely to value every source of biomass it can get, all while providing people with a low-cost recreation and a sense of security in a larger private space than they might've expected to get on Mars.  Sure, it'd all have to be indoor gardening, but indoor gardening architecture has been needing a revamp for decades now.

Humanity may be eating this world in an unsustainable way, but I'm still thinking ahead to that future when a spacefaring transhumanity with revamped mitochondria or other biotech adaptations will be unafraid of muscle wasting in space travel.  I think we'll have dragons in orbit, after all.  I don't even think Martian colonization is such a distant future thing.

I really wish I could figure out my campus housing situation.  I need laboratory training!  I want that covid-19 vaccine to be universally distributed in my area so that I can attend in-person classes... but then I still don't know how I'll be able to arrange proximity.  I would much rather arrange proximity than transportation, unless I can arrange transportation by self-driving car.  Traveling with strangers sounds too stressful and unapproachable...  I'd be more willing to sign up to let a self-driving car be used by a carpooling service when I'm not using it, than to try to sign up for such a service as one of the passengers sharing the vehicle.  My big personal space bubble is not the most economical trait.

I still drift between serial obsessions.  Sinking time into this dragora archive has served as a partial centralizing function which links the content and trajectories together better than I used to be capable of achieving, but there's still a lot of jank in my efforts to think through *anything*.

I have never welcomed nor been assisted by suggestions in this domain, but despite that my search has been necessary insular, I am still searching for ways to improve my productive coherency.  I wish machine-assisted free will was farther along.  Crows aren't the only species I'd like to see uplifted with mental transcription.  If I believed the technology safe enough, I would very much like to have access to it myself.

Back in Puzzlebox, I found the setting's use of mind control horrific, but I think in the end that may have been a misunderstanding of the longing that it represents.  I would've portrayed it differently.  If I could truly be the one controlling the process, I don't think controlled self-change would be anything but self-control, even if invasive nanotechnologies *were* involved.

Those were Yoet's *own* nanites, hahaha.

...but my mind is constantly veering off what I need to be doing.  Longing for machine-assisted free will is actually a longing for my fast-switching nature to get *faster*, but for that velocity to be used in a more accurate way.

Finished a school test I'd procrastinated on.

The worst kind of Huel soup so far is the yellow coconut curry soup.  Since I can't make it worse, I've decided to try to make it better; I dumped a teaspoon of mint chocolate flavoring into this mug of soup.  Chocolate is not adding something good to this flavor, but mint is less wrong than I expected; minty soups may be an underexplored territory.  On the other hand, the flavor is not exactly growing on me as I work through the bowl, so I wouldn't rate this as being markedly more palatable than the Huel yellow curry started out.

I'll try other flavorings that I have against the awful 'yellow coconut curry'... and maybe once I finish the bag, I'll celebrate at my next fast break by ordering a real yellow curry from somewhere that can do it right.
