#Age-of-Fire

I have read three books in this series.  Dragon Champion, Dragon Avenger, and Dragon Outcast.  Dragon Champion was brilliant and made me cry several times.  Dragon Avenger made me cry twice.  It was good until it had a dragon join a circus, and then it was tolerable, after which it ended strong.  Dragon Outcast went to shit, literally and metaphorically, as the author developed a fixation on dragon waste products that got worse.  It also ended badly as the lead character inexplicably installs dragon riders after rebelling against dragon riders being installed.
