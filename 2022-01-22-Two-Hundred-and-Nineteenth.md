I still want my privacy to be back intact.  It *isn't* yet.

Last night at one point, there was a guy at the nearest bus station quite near to my house screaming about killing gangstalkers.

Can you BE any more obvious?

That's gangstalker rhetoric itself.  That's not actual bloody targeted person rhetoric.  The targeted people just want their liberties respected, they're peaceful.  It's the gangstalkers who want their victims to be violently unstable, thereby to justify organized harassment against whoever they want to aim at.

We have corruption problems in my area, and the local corruption aims people my way.  They're bullshit.  I earned their hatred when I stopped putting out cybersexually.

I don't want secrecy, I want privacy.  They're different!  I should be just another citizen, but courtesy of the people who stalked me after I stopped being sexy for god-knows-who actually handled my case, I'm not.
