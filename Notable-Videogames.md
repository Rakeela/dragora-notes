# Notable Videogames

I love videogames.  I think they are a very high and advanced artform that will last forever, and the great videogames are artistic statements that will last forever.  I want to write about my engagement with them, and make them part of the record, attested as I am attested, and attestation unto me.

I can make of this a category.

One of the people who took an improper and unlawful interest in me took a keen interest in Nova Drift, so it's likely to get removed from the archive, as will this note.  The changelogs will of course still attest to it having at one time previously existed.  Draco18s is, unfortunately, not an actual friend of mine.  He'd need to talk to me a lot more than he ever has and ask for permissions that he's never sought for our connection to remain extant indefinitely.
