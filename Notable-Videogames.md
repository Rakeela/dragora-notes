# Notable Videogames

I love videogames.  I think they are a very high and advanced artform that will last forever, and the great videogames are artistic statements that will last forever.  I want to write about my engagement with them, and make them part of the record, attested as I am attested, and attestation unto me.

I can make of this a category.
