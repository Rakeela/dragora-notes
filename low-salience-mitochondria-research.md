# Low Salience Mitochondria Research

Although this is generically about mitochondria, I currently intend to link this node off of [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]] for organizational reasons.  For graph organization reasons, I will also link it to [[mitochondria-research-findings-by-others]] and [[non-research-mitochondria-links]].

   (Stem cell mitochondria are different from other mitochondria?)
