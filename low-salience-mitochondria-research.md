# Low Salience Mitochondria Research

Although this is generically about mitochondria, I currently intend to link this node off of [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]] for organizational reasons.  For graph organization reasons, I will also link it to [[mitochondria-research-findings-by-others]] and [[non-research-mitochondria-links]].

1. The role of mitochondria in stem cell fate and aging: https://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/145/8/dev143420.full.pdf
   (Stem cell mitochondria are different from other mitochondria?)
2. Chromosome-free bacterial cells are safe and programmable platforms for synthetic biology: https://www.pnas.org/content/117/12/6752
   (I'm not sure this is mitochondria-related, but I feel like I should save it and look at it later.)
3. P-bodies and mitochondria: Which place in RNA interference? https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0300908412001009
   (Mitochondria perform gene expression inhibition in their host cells?)
