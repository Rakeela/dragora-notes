#Toy-Story-2-1999

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

Wow, I found this one sad in a bad way.  I found it sad in the good way too, as in it was a dramatic story told well, but I also found it kind of pathetic in some obscure way.  It was a sequel that didn't need to exist and I thought it dragged down the tone of its setting, so I never watched another movie in the series after this one.
