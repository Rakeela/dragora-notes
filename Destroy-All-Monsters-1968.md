Retrofuturism!  They predicted video conferencing somewhat, but thought we'd be using phones while looking at video screens to do it.  Oh, but the movie is set in 1999!  We didn't have a moon base in '99... and I'm not sure we had video calls yet either.

But we certainly had more modern-looking automobiles.

This movie had a strange, strange moon.  I'll never forget about them launching a plan to attack a rival moonbase "through the swamps", and I joked while watching it that the moon has no swamps anymore because they were all destroyed by wars on the moon over fragile wilderness areas.
