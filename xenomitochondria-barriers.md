# Xenomitochondria Barriers

This is a catch-space for "why it won't work" info.

1. I've read that there's something different about mammalian mtDNA which may interfere with my wilder [[exogenous-mitochondria]] engineering concepts.
   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783712/ 
   "Engineering of mammalian mtDNA has been hampered by an inability to import nucleic acids into mitochondria."
   I don't understand the issue, but I can see at a glance that it doesn't necessarily prevent cross-engineering using mitochondria from other classifications.  In particular, re-engineering microbial mtDNA is unhindered, and may be all that is needed for bioreactor output optimization.
