One of the technologies from [[The-Viceroy]] is "Adaptive Antipsychotics", which are described as involving drugging the water to keep people psychologically stable.  The idea is that the antipsychotics available to galactic society are so safe and so completely tailorable to the needs of populations that the people who consume them actually get smarter and healthier.  Rather than drugging the populous into stupor, you therefore get to drug them into competency.

Of course, one of the *other* themes of the game is constant infiltration and resistance to advanced technology, so it looks like the new, more competent population is not necessarily more *enthused* or *grateful*... though some of them are.  You still get influence for deploying the tech until happiness levels are pretty remarkably high.

One of the other themes of the game, at least as I interpret it, is that "all interpretations are true simultaneously", to a substantial extent.  So underneath the veneer of optimistic positivity, there's a lot of suffering going down.  The adaptive antipsychotics probably aren't that adaptive; the people administrating the program may or may not have the strictly necessary competency to tailor them to the population; people with edge-case psychologies in a good way may be getting trimmed off along with epople who have edge-case psychologies in a bad way.  Most stuff is less good than it looks like, cumulative error is inevitable, and all of it falls apart eventually.

I mentioned in [[2021-4-9-Seventy-Ninth]] that I wouldn't take a portal to the world of Monster Girl Encyclopedia.  Well, despite the hazards, I think I *would* hop a portal to the world of The Viceroy.  Despite the chaos and suffering of a galaxy that is forever rebuilding, it looks like they have a lot of really awesome technologies that we haven't mastered on Earth, and their galaxy's problems will work out pretty nicely after what might be as little as another fifty thousand years of continued struggling.  Three hundred thousand years, at worst.  If you've got immortality, staying alive for that duration that is only a matter of either having important talents, or being good at emigrating ahead of disaster... and were *that* society to work out its issues, its pretty obvious that the result would be paradisic.

That said, Earth does have some advantages over the world of The Viceroy.  Cumulative error isn't quite as inevitable for us; efficiency gains are sometimes very real.  As my global health textbook points out, we eradicated smallpox!  Doing that was cost-effective and we didn't build a permanently entrenched bureaucracy in the process.  So maybe I'd rather steal some ideas rather than just hop worlds!

Adaptive antipsychotics are one of the ideas from the game that looks stealable to me.  Sure, I'm not thrilled by the idea of *drugging the water*, but if we really invent extremely safe antipsychotics whose usage makes people smarter and healthier, we shouldn't need to force their uptake IRL.  I think such drugs are possible!  I think humanity has yet to invent the last word in good antipsychotics and that there will be future efficiencies to gain when we advance that technology.

This kind of goes back to my [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]], too.  Truly adaptive antipsychotics may require looking away from our standing paradigms of treatment.  Neuroinflammation drives structural distortions in the way that the brain connects itself together.  I think that it may be helpful to look at mental illnesses as a form of nerve injury with links to autoimmunity.  If we could cure all improper autoreactivity in the brain, I think that people would have a greatly expanded ability to get better from mental illnesses of all forms... eventually.  Eliminating a malignant structural distortion in the brain won't instantly rewire it to eliminate symptoms, but medical technologists are no strangers to the idea that treatments may take long periods of time to achieve efficacy.

Neural inflammation is an eventual impairment to the mental health of (literally?) everyone.  Dementia also progresses with structural deformation of the brain due to cumulative autoreactivity.  So dendritic cell therapies to reduce neural autoreactivity could be "adaptive antipsychotics" on Earth: a misery-reducing and intelligence-preserving technology that we should want to see implemented universally if we develop the capacity of doing so.

Just including this as a source link for my claim that neuroinflammation factors in dementia.  Note that even if specific causes of neuroinflammation are not autoreactive, it is my belief (potentially erroneous) that autoreactivity errors accumulate in the immune systems of *all* people given sufficient longevity.  As such, even if autoreactivity is not the predominant driver of inflammation, if people start living forever eventually everyone will benefit from autoreactivity control.  Adding secondary sources of inflammation only makes primary sources of inflammation more immiserating.

I was pain-free while I was studying health, but I loaded up a math assignment and became overwhelmed by pain.  What the hell, that kind of fluctuation feels like someone who isn't honest enough to engage with integrity is artificially punishing me for the sin of thinking that I can perform math.  I'm not exactly losing points on the assignment either; it's going fine, albeit agonizingly slowly due to arbitrary sudden pain.  As usual, my actual math competency is fine.

I feel like someone deeply primitive got enraged at me for trying to do math and did something highly unusual so that they could be mathematically superior to me, despite my actual basic talent.  Maybe I should take advanced mathematics just to piss off the unknown observer...  it is actually my plan to take as much math as I can.
