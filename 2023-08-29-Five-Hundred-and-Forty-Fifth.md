4:11.  I went to bed very early last night and got up earlier than usual this morning as well.  I might still go back to bed, but for the moment I am up and checking if Goodbye Volcano High has released yet.

4:15.  Steam says it unlocks in less than an hour.  Um.  Maybe I'll just lay down for a bit.

8:55.  I fell back asleep!

12:15.  I couldn't even play much of Goodbye Volcano High.  I was too nervous about 'playing correctly' and I was worried I wouldn't get the character relationships developed correctly.

12:21.  I don't want to walk.  I don't want to game.  I don't want to write.  I just want to rest.  Why am I so tired?  I'm caffeinated!

15:10.  I laid on the couch for a while to try to shake off the tiredness, and I spent the whole time arguing with voices in my head.  I'm half-convinced someone put me on a list of disposable test subjects targeted for brain-hacking, aimed at people "who everyone hates".  It's like... release everything I've ever written.  I have integrity.  I'm not *reliant* on secrecy, I was *forced* into secrecy.  Like most people are.  Our society gives light to very few, and is merciless to everyone else.  Anyways, after that I argued on 4chan for a while, trying to argue against today's authority figures.  I don't argue for bigotry on that site, I argue against it!

15:15.  I guess I ought to write.  I'm really not feelin' it today.  I've got a friend who thinks I've been busy lately.  I can't tell him that I've actually been struggling to focus on my writing.  85,456.

17:54.  I've been arguing online.  Trying to turn the momentum of a bigoted forum.

17:55.  I don't know what to have happen next in Kura and Kaire.  I have to rewrite Kura's side of the story.  I want to establish more...  more cause to doubt the ethics of her assigned militia team.

18:29.  I plan to order from Zaucer at some point this week.  Maybe Thursday or Friday!

18:57.  Credit 1,072 words editing.  I'm taking a break.  I need to think about what happens next in the story.  I'm completely unsure.
