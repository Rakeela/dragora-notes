19:45.  49,823.  The blank page effect has been ferocious on my latest chapter.  I ran out my ideas.

19:57.  50,070.  Not very satisfying progress, but I need to stop already and keep thinking.  My writer's block is being hard to dissolve.

21:31.  50,454.  631 words of progress.  I've found a flaw in my story.

21:34.  Credit 14 words edited.  Credit the 631 words of progress.  New baseline: 50,440.

21:37.  50,472.  Grr.  Bad error in story construction.  A small group of characters has been almost entirely left out of Greeve's Ambition.  Even though one of them *dies*.
