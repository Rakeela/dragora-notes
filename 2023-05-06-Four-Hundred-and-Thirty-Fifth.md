I love my shelf of candies.  It's mostly chocolates.  It's this altar to what I love in this world: the sweets!  I look forward to eating some of it, but eating it will leave holes in the altar.  I'll have to have replacements ready first.

I think having a sweets altar discourages consumption more effectively than having a sweets drawer had done.  I thought the drawer would get my sweets "out of sight, out of mind", but the altar really makes it appealing to just keep my sweets.  It's a collection!
