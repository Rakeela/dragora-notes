The downside of stopping every day on a corner is that I start every day on a corner.  There's always something that I don't want to write.  It works well enough when I actually write it...  This is why I like rewriting scenes.  A rewrite is never in a corner.  I always have material to work from.  Making stuff up ex nihilo is harder.

Starting with 988 on the file.  Need 931 today.

2,619 words on the file.  1,631 words of progress, 700 words over quota.  That flew by!  I really should keep working, but I'll update for now.

I played a bit of Star Traders Frontiers, and by "a bit" I mean "seventy minutes".  I've got a merchant-hospital ship running.  I like imagining the charitable voyage of the increasingly popular Captain Insiro, who fears only the xeno because all the faction ships leave him be.  Even the pirates don't attack.  21 Medical Rating and 4 doctors to keep the "Generous in Service" procs going.

It's not all charity.  I did a two-step rare goods trade for about 400k profit.  I briefly passed the 1 million credit line, but that funded an upgrade to my hospital ward.

Star Traders Frontiers strikes me as an "evil" setting.  Very corrupt, very dangerous.  I don't trust the factions in it at all.  I keep imagining that the game's "xeno" are something other than how they're reported, like how the Relians in the Archeons series get painted as super-evil.  In today's play I got attacked by "xeno" right after buying a bunch of medical bays (a rare good).  I had prepped for that in-game (using the "skip off the void" talent), but it stood out that it happened *right then*.

I then delivered those medical bays to a planet with a totalitarian government.  Delivering exotic medical supplies is a good thing, right?  Except now people will be healthier in a totalitarian society.  I bet that only helps people who are useful to the state.

For the second leg of my two-step rare goods trade, I bought "spice wax", a legality-3 good.  Almost nowhere permits the sale of legality-3 goods.  I was planning to carry them to a black market contact to sell them, but I found a legal outlet on a planet with the right kind of economy and no trade law to get in the way.  At legality-3, the spice wax is probably some kind of horrible addictive drug.  So my hospital ship traveled the galaxy hopping through hyperspace to deliver a large shipment of addictive drugs to an anarchistic society.  At least they didn't get sold somewhere they were illegal, right?

For better or for worse, you can't really make a difference in the game.  The planet stats are fixed at map-gen.  The totalitarian government stays a totalitarian government no matter how much you spy, siege, defend, or trade with it.  Likewise the anarchic zone stays anarchic.  Populations and economies never grow or shrink, even if the game goes on for hundreds of in-game years.

I noticed something I liked during today's play.  The populations in the game are refreshingly small.  Planets have population values that are compared to singular communities.  This one has the population of a settlement, that one has the population of a metropolis.  Nowhere are the populations like modern nations.  Definitely not like some sci-fi where planets have even larger populations than the population of Earth.

2,619 words on the file.  No, wait.  I need to start a new file.  0 words on the file.  Let's get in another writing session.

322 words on the new file.  I've been stalled at this point for quite a while, so I'm just going to accept that I'm not producing any more writing today.  I'll report my productivity at this point.

I feel divinely favored by an incompetent god.  Like there's a god who loves me very much, but they've blundered a lot, and maybe they're struggling to fix it.  Like there's a divine plan, but it kinda sucks, and it's not secretly a good thing that it sucks.

Using Amazon to send a gift to someone else is a highly disconcerting experience.  I thought it'd be user-friendly, but I had to add the address to which I was sending as though it was my own, and then subsequently I had to remove it again.
