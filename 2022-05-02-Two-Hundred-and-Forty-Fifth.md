Mark my words, someone watched me play [[The Viceroy]].  That much happened and should not have.

That game still behaves with improper modifications when I play it, and so for instance the Commonwealth Unifier achievements are blocked from activation.  Considering that I believe the pursuit of justice is the true foundation of civilization - a Unifier belief - that's really upsetting.  I was blocked from getting the achievements for my true faction in the game.  Millennial Reign was also blocked from activating, even though I've passed the thousand turn threshold repeatedly.

The Viceroy also hyperactivates schizophrenia symptoms like nothing else.  I think that's artificially enforced.  It's deeply upsetting.  I think that someone did something to my brain for real.

I want those achievements!  I suspect that everything which puts the Empire over the Panarchy was blocked from being achieved.  The Panarchy in that game is godawful authoritarian and comes off as a failed uplift project by failing to be sapient enough to protect happiness.  The schizophrenia hyperactivation treats me as Imperial, "coincidentally" enough, which I disagree with; the Empire barely does anything right and IMO is worth less than the Panarchy.  In ascending order of factional worth, the factions go Empire -> Panarchy -> Commonwealth.  That sequence in-game is the Commonwealth Consensus, which is NATALISTIC, ie they're shitty parents who destroy the worth of their society by overpopulating without loving each other enough.

I just favor the Unifiers for their prizing of the Seat of Justice, which all societies should be founded on.  I got into liberalism because I cared about doing the right thing!

I'm convinced that I was put under observation after I stopped putting out cybersexually.  I believe I was expected to be a sexual predator peeling out of a control structure (or some similar excuse).  Yet all my years of longing for the people who exploited me to have an autogenerator for sex were ignored.  Everything I rejected was imputed to me, and all my complaints about stress and anxiety in the cybersexual service role were ignored.
