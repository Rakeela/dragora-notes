#Afterlife

This game about running an afterlife as a "Demiurge" really fired up my imagination.  I often imagine experiencing the different rewards in Heaven, most especially the Hindsight Habitation.  I like imagining that the multiverse can be sewn up over infinite time, so that every version of a person can be united into one multiversal exemplar of that person, and the work would be done in Hindsight Habitations where different variations of the same lifetime were played out.  Sometimes however, this vision seems very sad to me as it would be a lot of mortal suffering along the way to perfecting an individual, so a properly paradisic implementation of this would involve lots of downtime, therapy, and visiting of other Rewards in Heaven.

A few of the rewards really bring back to mind that it's a "demiurge" game, like the "Brahmatic Bovine Bliss Ranch" where people are turned into cows to be totally blissed out.  I don't like the idea of turning into a cow and I think this is hurtful to the otherwise very creative and fun Contentment line of Rewards.  I think the penultimate Contentment reward exemplifies what the Contentment Rewards can really be about: I would love to visit a Musement Park for instance!

The 19th Tee Links reward for Peace is another one that kind of stings.  I'm a pacifist, but I don't love golfing.  The penultimate reward is Swords into Ploughshares, which depicts an arcology built in a giant missile.  I love that.  The second best structure is really conceptually much cooler than the best structure.

In my own playthroughs of the game I noticed that it's a lot easier to get to Love Domes if you keep your angel quotient at 10% imported, but you push on towards Ragnarok that way.  I'm not sure if Ragnarok still happens if you aren't running Hell, and maybe I should try just doing a totally-homegrown-angels run.
