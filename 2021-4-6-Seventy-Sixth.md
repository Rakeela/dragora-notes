I'm having the problem with Huel that it is not hedonically superior to a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet.  I'd rather eat a small, but diverse selection of protein-focused foods, rather than "you can eat as much as you like, but only from this selection of soups and shake powders".  I feel better on Huel and I still do seem to lose weight that way, but it's *not* delicious... or even really tolerable.

So I marked a fast period in this week, because I already want to take a break from Huel.

I intend to make a savory bacon shake out of Huel at some point tomorrow, though.  Hopefully that'll be better, though there's a substantial risk it'll just be inedible.

Ethically speaking, it would be better to work on insects than on mice, because insects really cannot think... but insect biology is too far away to make useful inferences from it.  I wonder if it would be possible to make cybermice with artificial brains that provide only insect-level processing while leaving the bulk of the mouse metabolism unmodified so as to continue providing a mammallian model of most processes.  That's crazy hyper-ethical thought of course, humanity doesn't have the resources to spare for that.

I don't want to do anything for this world.  Knowing that there's no justice for what happened to me - that people treated me as having all power in relationships where I was powerless, and that's the reality considered "true" no matter what is actually true - it's hard to convince myself that I should struggle and do anything difficult for anyone else.

My life was set up so that doing things for others would support and enable rapists.  I wasn't allowed to have enough privacy to do things purely for myself, so why should I do anything?
