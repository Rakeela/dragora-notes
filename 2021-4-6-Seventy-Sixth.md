#2021-4-6-Seventy-Sixth

I'm having the problem with Huel that it is not hedonically superior to a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet.  I'd rather eat a small, but diverse selection of protein-focused foods, rather than "you can eat as much as you like, but only from this selection of soups and shake powders".  I feel better on Huel and I still do seem to lose weight that way, but it's *not* delicious... or even really tolerable.

So I marked a fast period in this week, because I already want to take a break from Huel.

I intend to make a savory bacon shake out of Huel at some point tomorrow, though.  Hopefully that'll be better, though there's a substantial risk it'll just be inedible.
