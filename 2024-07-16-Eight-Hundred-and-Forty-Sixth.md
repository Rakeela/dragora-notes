7:48.  90,256.  90,290.  I've been working for a little bit...  like half an hour.

8:54.  A shot of absinthe in a (plastic) glass of strawberry monster created a milky white drink with a really complicated flavor.  I didn't like it at first sip, but I added a little bit more of the monster, and now I like it a lot.

9:56.  Credit 3,002 words edited.  90,521.

12:07.  Credit 2,407 words edited.  90,618.

18:46.  Credit 548 words edited.  90,828.  I have not been significantly productive today.  Well, that's not fair.  I got a bit done.  It was...  really sporadic, though.

18:47.  I worked for short intervals between long distractions.  I was pretty productive when I was doing anything productive at all.

20:54.  I got hit by a bout of severe pain.  I felt weakness and pain in my limbs.  My legs felt like they could barely hold me.  My forearms hurt.  I was slumped on my desk.  And I was hurting so much, it was breaking up my thoughts.

20:55.  Kistaro reminded me to take potassium.  The pain and weakness started receding.  I'm still in pain, but not... like that.

21:02.  It takes like ten minutes for potassium to take effect.  So when I said Kistaro reminded me to take potassium...  it'd been a few minutes.

21:07.  My foot hurts!  My right foot.  It's throbbing.  For some reason, my left collarbone hurts as well.

21:08.  These things were already hurting, and the potassium didn't help.
