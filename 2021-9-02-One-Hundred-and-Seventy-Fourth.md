I've decided that I should add [[Polis-Diamonil]] to this archive as a cluster in it.  Polis Diamonil is the redemption of NationStates, a site that has brought me tremendous grief, but which also brought me... peacocks!  I created a setting of colorfully fowl urbanites to try to wring some good narrative potential out of the wild mixture of chaos and overexposure to which that site's systems subject its playerbase.  It worked.  Mostly.  I still found it ultimately dreary.  Praise Tekazien, I found a way through.
