5:47.  I woke up at 5:19 and got out of bed at 5:23.  There was then time spent getting dressed and a few minutes catching up on Discord, before I decided that I should record something (near) when I woke up.

6:44.  47,984.  Done with morning stuff.

7:25.  48,336.  1,921 words on the chapter.

8:21.  2,629 words on the chapter.

8:37.  49,258.  2,892 words on the chapter.

8:49.  49,327.  2,952 words on the chapter.  1,343 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  Haven't cleared quota, so obviously I have to start in on the next chapter.

9:10.  49,337.  0 words on the chapter.  I'm kinda distractedly pushing words around.

9:14.  Yeah, I am totally distracted.  I keep thinking about food.  I'm not scheduled to eat for another three hours.

9:22.  Did dishes.  Still thinking about food.  I'm worried that I'm going to totally overeat today.  I've been eating one meal a day lately while doing 24-hour fasts between each meal.  One large meal is pretty satisfying as patterns go, but a shocking amount of calories can be consumed at one meal.

9:25.  I'm planning to credit myself with 348 words edited today.  This is an entirely arbitrary estimate of how much I've backtracked and reviewed earlier materials.

9:26.  Ooh, this next chapter of Kura and Kaire is haaaard.  I'm still struggling with religion's role in the story.  How do I write a religious viewpoint character into K&K?  I tried this in my earlier draft, but my treatment there was disappointing.

10:25.  49,796.  462 words on the chapter.

10:27.  I just got hit by a disappointment with something in an early chapter.

10:39.  49,862.  I edited the early chapter.  3,345 words edited.

11:48.  807 words on the chapter.  I took a break to watch Kistaro play a game, and I'm getting back to watching it imminently.

17:32.  Since my last timepoint, I fell asleep for a few hours, I went to the grocery store, I played a round of Race for the Galaxy, and I faffed about not wanting to get on my treadmill.  So I've put the treadmill away and brought my chair in.

17:43.  50,207.  807 words on the chapter.  2,223 words of progress.  Haven't progressed, just doing a retally.  Sometimes it helps me focus.  I'm in a Kaire chapter, but now he's leaving the vicinity of his 'kingdom'.  This is the point where the story starts containing humans, which perhaps hurts my enthusiasm.

18:22.  Reading TvTropes...

19:04.  50,274.  848 words on the chapter.  I'm at the first point in the story where I would describe a human population, and bleeeeh.  Humans remind me of all the ethnic squabbles on Earth.

19:43.  I meant to add this to my prior post.  Kistaro encouraged me to take humans out of Kura and Kaire.  I'm still thinking about it.

19:45.  Considering the editing of 1,276 words.

19:54.  50,274.  871 words on the chapter.  I performed the edits to remove humans from the story.

20:28.  50,397.  994 words on the chapter.

21:26.  50,621.  1,218 words on the chapter.  I'm not being hugely productive.  I don't know what I'm doing with this specific bit of the story.  I've got a great idea coming up, though.
