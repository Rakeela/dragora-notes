6:27.  How could so much time have passed?  I got up at 5:30.  How could it have been an hour since I got up?  I haven't done much.

6:45.  I tallied that I did 3,045 words of editing yesterday, and since then I've been catching up on Discord.

6:58.  So sleepy.  It's difficult not to go back to bed.

7:02.  There's a spider on the wall down here.  I don't want to deal with it.  Kistaro always says that house spiders are harmless.  If I just go to bed, I can get Kistaro to deal with it if it's still around later, and it probably won't be.  It's a very large spider.

7:13.  Ugh.  Yeah, I'm going to lay back down.

11:14.  79,002.  This is a very strange tally, because I finished yesterday at slightly less than this.  Oh!  I edited slightly before taking the tally.  I see what I changed.  78,995.

13:31.  79,846.  851 words of progress.

13:41.  79,850.  855 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  2,463 words on the (next) chapter.

13:54.  Credit 36 words edited.  79,899.

17:33.  80,390.  I read a book for a while.  1,395 words of progress.

17:49.  80,504.  That's quota.  Credit 2,127 words edited.

18:21.  80,651.  Credit 2,568 words of editing.  Tallying...  4,731 words of editing.  1,656 words of progress.
