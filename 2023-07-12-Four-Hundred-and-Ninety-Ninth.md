08:23.  I've been up for...  forty minutes?  Not sure.  Haven't gotten to work yet.

9:48.  61,263.  I thought I'd get to work faster than that.  This is a bad morning.  Almost every morning is bad.  Why am I so slow?

10:11.  61,590.  2,720 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.

10:14.  61,615.  0 words on the chapter.  I need to break for a moment to go to the store for something.

11:25.  Okay, I took way longer to get back to work than just the time it took to go to the store.  I'm back to it now.  Kinda.  I don't know what to write next.  I'm stalled!  I'm so short of quota that I have to find a way to keep writing.

12:04.  62,389.  1,126 words of progress.  I feel run down and dizzy.

14:02.  For thirty five minutes, I lay on the couch trying to recover.  I felt no better.  Then, I came over here and played Cultist Simulator.  Now I feel better.  Playing Cultist Simulator is like praying for inspiration.  I am praying for advancement.  More passion, more reason, more insight.  More inspiration...  I am fascinated by the "Influences" in that game, and the concept of painting with these powerful sentiments.  I want to write with powerful sentiments, but I am a dim shadow of what I long for.

16:24.  64,412.  2,797 words on the chapter.  3,149 words of progress.

18:31.  34,640 steps.  1,695 kcal.  9.3 miles.  1.1 mph average speed.  7 hours, 49 minutes, 26 seconds.  I accidentally double-pressed when I meant to pause the treadmill to take a break.  I think I'll just push the treadmill back and stop here for the night.
