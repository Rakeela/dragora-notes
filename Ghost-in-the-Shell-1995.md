Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  2022-12-17

This one's great!  I've forgotten all about it, but I'll rewatch it next Saturday.  It'll be like new again thanks to my flawed memory, but I know I've seen it before.

As I thought, it looks pretty new.  If I really don't recognize any of it, I may update the "Date First Watched" entry to reflect that.  I could swear "the Puppet Master" is familiar, though.

A vague sense of familiarity clung to me as I was watching the movie, but it wasn't as good as I thought it was.
