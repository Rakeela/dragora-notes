#Battlefield-Earth

This one is most strongly associated to me with a two-week summer stint at my mother's house.  It was then the largest book that I'd ever read, not counting the bible.  I got through it by pure determination to do so, reading at every hour I could, and I still felt it took an embarrassingly long time to finish.  I did also enjoy it, but there were points when I think I would've stopped if I weren't determined to read "the longest book I'd ever read," as I (erroneously) thought of it.  I think I was 8 at the time.
