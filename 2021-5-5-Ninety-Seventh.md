I've recently finished [[Monster-Girl-Encyclopedia]].  I entered into it thinking to vampirize the book's psychic energy.  I pretty much feel like I've done so.  I've commented on it in a few different day-logs; after I write this up I plan to go into the book's page and link back to the day-logs where I commented about it.  I think this will be a new way that I take notes on books as I read them.

My review is pretty dire, but I'm glad I read the book.  Permitting more of the right to complain about bad sex is one of the things that I think a stronger sex-positivity would've gotten right in my youth, which would have saved me so much grief.  This gave me an opportunity to express that.

I hope the author of the books is prosperous.

Note to self:  Review the log from my conversation on this date with Kistaro.  I've realized that the Whore/Hitler Dichotomy to which I was subject may be an important radicalization psychology dynamic which can be used by manipulative people who are willing to "accept" either archetype.  This could be important for sociological research against authoritarianism.

Right now I'm just putting up a note-to-self because I've invested a lot of thought into this today already, and I NEED to find a way to change my mental context, drop this, and do math.  I've recorded enough into the conversation with Kistaro that I can pick it up from that basis later.

Speaking of notes to self, there's a "gryphon genethief" story that I've been noodling over.  There is finally nobody requiring me to do it in any way whatsoever, and no possible gain for me to achieve in making it.  I'm thinking about whether I can creatively channel some of my frustrations.  For instance, the gryphon genethief concept relies on "men never turn down free sex" - can I strike that concept in some artistic way?  It's also about "hypergamy", which I think is a very loveless concept that denigrates both men and women by denigrating affectionate attachment between people.

I think the concept of the story hits so many points of awfulness that I probably can't do it justice, but I've been thinking about it for a while.  I'll keep thinking about it.  I wonder if I can tie it to the Whore/Hitler Dichotomy that I was thinking about - could that help me make any of the points I would wish for the story to make?
