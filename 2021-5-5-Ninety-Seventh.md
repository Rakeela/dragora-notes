I've recently finished [[Monster-Girl-Encyclopedia]].  I entered into it thinking to vampirize the book's psychic energy.  I pretty much feel like I've done so.  I've commented on it in a few different day-logs; after I write this up I plan to go into the book's page and link back to the day-logs where I commented about it.  I think this will be a new way that I take notes on books as I read them.

My review is pretty dire, but I'm glad I read the book.  Permitting more of the right to complain about bad sex is one of the things that I think a stronger sex-positivity would've gotten right in my youth, which would have saved me so much grief.  This gave me an opportunity to express that.

I hope the author of the books is prosperous.

Note to self:  Review the log from my conversation on this date with Kistaro.  I've realized that the Whore/Hitler Dichotomy to which I was subject may be an important radicalization psychology dynamic which can be used by manipulative people who are willing to "accept" either archetype.  This could be important for sociological research against authoritarianism.

Right now I'm just putting up a note-to-self because I've invested a lot of thought into this today already, and I NEED to find a way to change my mental context, drop this, and do math.  I've recorded enough into the conversation with Kistaro that I can pick it up from that basis later.
