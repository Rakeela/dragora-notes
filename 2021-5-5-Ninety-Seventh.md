#2021-5-5-Ninety-Seventh

I've recently finished [[Monster-Girl-Encyclopedia]].  I entered into it thinking to vampirize the book's psychic energy.  I pretty much feel like I've done so.  I've commented on it in a few different day-logs; after I write this up I plan to go into the book's page and link back to the day-logs where I commented about it.  I think this will be a new way that I take notes on books as I read them.

My review is pretty dire, but I'm glad I read the book.  Permitting more of the right to complain about bad sex is one of the things that I think a stronger sex-positivity would've gotten right in my youth, which would have saved me so much grief.  This gave me an opportunity to express that.

I hope the author of the books is prosperous.
