I've recently finished [[Monster-Girl-Encyclopedia]].  I entered into it thinking to vampirize the book's psychic energy.  I pretty much feel like I've done so.  I've commented on it in a few different day-logs; after I write this up I plan to go into the book's page and link back to the day-logs where I commented about it.  I think this will be a new way that I take notes on books as I read them.

My review is pretty dire, but I'm glad I read the book.  Permitting more of the right to complain about bad sex is one of the things that I think a stronger sex-positivity would've gotten right in my youth, which would have saved me so much grief.  This gave me an opportunity to express that.

I hope the author of the books is prosperous.

Note to self:  Review the log from my conversation on this date with Kistaro.  I've realized that the Whore/Hitler Dichotomy to which I was subject may be an important radicalization psychology dynamic which can be used by manipulative people who are willing to "accept" either archetype.  This could be important for sociological research against authoritarianism.

Right now I'm just putting up a note-to-self because I've invested a lot of thought into this today already, and I NEED to find a way to change my mental context, drop this, and do math.  I've recorded enough into the conversation with Kistaro that I can pick it up from that basis later.

Speaking of notes to self, there's a "gryphon genethief" story that I've been noodling over.  There is finally nobody requiring me to do it in any way whatsoever, and no possible gain for me to achieve in making it.  I'm thinking about whether I can creatively channel some of my frustrations.  For instance, the gryphon genethief concept relies on "men never turn down free sex" - can I strike that concept in some artistic way?  It's also about "hypergamy", which I think is a very loveless concept that denigrates both men and women by denigrating affectionate attachment between people.

I think the concept of the story hits so many points of awfulness that I probably can't do it justice, but I've been thinking about it for a while.  I'll keep thinking about it.  I wonder if I can tie it to the Whore/Hitler Dichotomy that I was thinking about - could that help me make any of the points I would wish for the story to make?

I was thinking about it more in the shower, and of course there's a way that I could use the Whore/Hitler Dichotomy in a gryphon genethief story.  I could have the genethieves teach it as a method of gaining sexual compliance.  They would be focusing on the Whore side of the Dichotomy and emphasizing the Hitler side as authoritarian, prettifying the Whore side as a pure celebration of liberation even though they engage in an exceedingly loveless manner.

I could even have them be 'helping' people fulfill a reproductive mandate.  After all, people who don't reproduce are wholly meaningless, and the non-reproducers have to do *something* to deserve rights.  The genethieves are merciful and liberating!  However, this might be going too far.

The basic idea of building the Whore/Hitler Dichotomy into a story and having an organization of dubious ethics wield it might be something to work with.  On the other hand, since I'm not trying to impress anyone, I may not use this idea for a very long time.

It's kind of nice to have a porn idea and not be expected to be WILDLY ENTHUSIASTIC about it.  People around me demanded the right of unchallenged satire that could be neither criticized nor pointed out, even as they denied me the right of making any satire at all by treating me as authoritarian or dishonest if I ever expressed disliking things.  I was always supposed to be 10/10-positive about everything if I wrote anything faintly appealing about it.

Whereas if I wrote the gryphon genethief story, sure I'd try to make the sex scenes hot.  It'd be up to the reader to notice the story's dearths... unless or until the protagonist stopped playing along.
