# Transgenic Algae

Algae actually has a lot of industrial applications, and I wonder if it has even more that haven't yet been invented.  I read recently that dyes are extracted from algae.  Could we engineer algae to produce new colors?  This is just a thought, but it may be the start of further thought.  Algae are fast-growing crops whose predominant inputs are chemicals that we otherwise consider pollutants.  As I understand the issue (I may be wrong), the primary restraint on the production of algae is the undesirability of algae as a crop.  Genetic engineering should be able to fix that!
