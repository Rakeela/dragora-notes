**Session start**
Something about the project mentioned right at the start of the session...  I still don't know what to expect from the projects in this class.  Oh dear, it's something in the online service that is already opened to be worked on.  Forty questions long and somewhat enigmatic...  I suppose I'll have to email the professor for information, though I'll start by trying to puzzle it out myself.  At least something is being talked about that isn't interminable discussion of the properties of r.
