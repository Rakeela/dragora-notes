62 hours into my fast.  I have chocolate covered oreos in my Christmas stash.  Oreos are a weird hyperpalatable food.  I don't quite like them, but I'm drawn to them nonetheless.  They're in some kind of edgecase where hyperpalatability and palatability disagree.  I wouldn't believe that was possible if I didn't have a distinct example of it happening.  Special occasion oreos seem delightful and the three chocolate covered oreos in my stash seem like a reasonable serving size.  They're wrapped in the colors of the Italian flag.

I want to shred some of my candy with a knife, flaying it open and examining it closely, the better to pretend to eat it.  But then I'd have to buy more... and I don't know if I could resist the temptation to lick it and eat tiny bites of it.  I would still lose weight if I did that, but I wouldn't consider it proper fasting.  Besides, tiny amounts of sugar might be enough to disrupt my body's fat-burning.

I have editing feedback for The Turning Wind, my second manuscript.  I've made a start and tweaked it a bit.  I've also been rereading it.  It's painful to reread.  I don't like it.  I've spotted bits that seem stilted, too.  My pre-readers really like this story.  I don't think it stands out positively.  I'm surrounded by dragon books that are more draconic than my own writing.

I think The Tachanigh-Kelkaith is a better book.  I've reread it more and enjoyed it more on rereading it.  It was less painful to edit.

63 hours.  I need to be working, but I'm so, so tired.  273 hours remain.  Will I really succeed at this fast?  Isn't it more important to get my second manuscript edited in time?  I want marzipan!

---
Uuuugh.  I am emotionally unable to continue approaching The Turning Wind.  Time to stop editing and start working on new writing.  Starting with 1,082 words on the file and a writing target of 735 words.

1,121 words on the file.  A meager 39 words of progress before I stalled in distraction.

64 hours.  I got distracted reading about vegetarianism.  It makes me long to go to the nearby Panda Express and order the vegetarian option off of their menu.  I'm so glad they have one.  I hope vegetarianism spreads and takes over the world.  Without necessarily incorporating meat bans.  Eating meat should, ideally, be safe, legal, and rare.

1,296 words on the file.  214 words of progress.  This file is done; beginning another one.  Target word count for the new file is 521.

860 words of progress on the new file.  1,074 words of progress, 339 words over quota.

1,139 words of progress on the new file.  1,353 words of progress, 618 words over quota.

1,357 words of progress on the new file.  1,571 words of progress, 818 words over quota.  I think this file is done.

67 hours.  Despite my noting of the hours, I'm not too hungry right now.  I was very bothered by hunger earlier, but despite my lack of eating, that seems to have subsided.

---
Starting a new file.  I'm stalled at 349 words.  1,920 words of progress, 1,167 words over quota.  I feel like I'm running dry on inspiration for today.

I have visited all but one candy seller in Redmond today.  I am likely to visit the last one tomorrow.  My candy hoard has grown magnificently.  My best acquisition are "dates royale", which are deglet dates filled with peanut butter and enrobed in chocolate.  I never imagined such a thing.  Ooh, I look forward to eating them!  I can eat a huge amount of dates in a sitting.  Those might not survive Christmas day.

I also picked up cappucino nougat!  As well as amarette nougat, but I don't think it'll be as good as the cappucino nougat.  Both of them I'm excited to have, because just pushing nougat as a candy is exciting.  It ought to be the best nougat ever.  Tomorrow perhaps I'll list off more of my acquisitions.  <3

70 hours.  266 hours remaining.  I think I'll be fine... for this ambition.  I'll break my fasting record.  Journaling is helping.  Candy-collecting is ecstatic.

But I got editing feedback recently.  I mentioned it earlier.  It's killing me.  I have a deadline.  I have a week to turn around my fourth draft, and instead I did 1,920 words of Ekis' Travelogue, my worst project yet.

I've devoured two handfuls of spinach, five mushrooms (I think that was the count), and three sticks of celery.  Am I giving up fasting?  Nope.  These are low calorie freebies.  I can fill up on these and have eaten very little.  I'm not religiously fasting (I'd have just broken a religious fast), I'm just dieting at near-zero calories.

I ate a bunch of mushrooms yesterday, too.

Approaching 75 hours.  I want to record another of my desires.  I have a roll of pumpkin spice dough of the kind that's supposed to separate easily to be cooked into five biscuits.  I'm going to eat one of the biscuits raw.  The container says not to do that, but I'm going to do it anyways.  The rest of them I will cook.  I don't expect the one I eat raw to be delicious.  Maybe I'll take a bite and throw out the rest of one biscuit.  Still, I want to try it raw.

It is so, so tempting to break fast and devour the pumpkin spice dough immediately.  I am looking forward to this.
