13:31.  I woke up at 10 AM this morning and hard a hard time getting out of bed.  I was so sluggish, heavy, and tired.  I still feel a little bit of that.  I've been scattered overall this morning.  I dealt with stuff I do daily, then I talked with friends about a Kingdom game that I'm trying to get together.  It feels like I haven't done enough for three and a half hours.

13:39.  83,986 words on the file.  I'm a little frustrated with yesterday's writing.  It seemed like a candidate for ending up on the cutting room floor then, and it still seems like that now.  Even if I keep it, I'm likely to change it so that it accords more exactly to a scene from The Tachanigh-Kelkaith, and thus is more likely to be comprehended by readers.

14:07.  84,268 words on the file.  282 words of progress.  Describing journeys in brief is becoming very relaxing.  I enjoy the segments where theomes are being passed through.  I'm paused at this juncture in my writing because I have to transition back to, er, action time.

14:38.  84,709 words on the file.  723 words of progress.  I'm mid-scene on some chattering between the characters.  Kinda not sure what I'm doing with the story right at this moment.

15:10.  I took a break for a while.  Not very productive in a cognitive sense, honestly.  Kistaro would probably say that resting the brain is important, or something to that effect, but I feel better if I'm finding inspiration in all things.  I still have half my quota left to write.

15:46.  85,201 words on the file.  1,215 words of progress.  Still characters chatting.

15:52.  85,247 words on the file.  1,261 words of progress.  I don't know what I'm doing with this conversation.  It's good world-building, but I have to move the story forward, too.

16:24.  85,683 words on the file.  1,697 words of progress.  Argh, I don't want to stop.  I'm retreading my old ideas rampantly in this conversation and I can't tell if it's okay to do this.  I added one new thing and I've called back to a bunch of old things.  I need someone to read this and tell me if it's fun or un-novel.

17:26.  86,192 words on the file.  2,206 words of progress.  Okay, I think I want to stop here.

19:18.  My weight jumped today.  You'd think I ate a pound and a half of food.  Instead, I ate a veggie bowl and two small cookies.  The cookies were 320 calories.  I'd have to check at the store for another box to find out what exactly the veggie bowl was, but it wasn't huge.  There's no way I ate even a thousand calories today.

19:42.  I made a quick trip to the (adjacent) grocery store to ascertain the caloric weight of the bowl.  I also picked up some sugarfree mint chocolate chip ice cream that was on clearance.  If I eat that instead of a cookie...  Anyways.  The "Buddha bowl" that I ate this morning was 490 calories.  That's a cumulate 810 calories.  I've walked more than that on my treadmill today.  Calories in vs calories out is such a questionable metric.

20:10.  I looked up "How to Taste Chocolate" today on Google, and this is the best result I found: https://damecacao.com/how-to-taste-chocolate/  I love this tasting stuff even though personally I've never 'detected' much in flavours.

21:34.  I'm really dissatisfied.  I'm getting close to ending Ekis' Travelogue (at least the second draft thereof), and I don't know HOW I'm ending it.
