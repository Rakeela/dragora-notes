12:41. 27,051.  I slept in today.

14:13.  27,434.  I have, like... no inspiration.  I had the inspiration to make one particular change to the story, and I went with it, but then I had nothing and could make no progress.

16:29.  28,969.  1,918 words of progress.  3,344 words on the chapter.  Going to the store.

21:04.  29,682.  2,631 words of progress.  4,057 words on the chapter.  I am dissatisfied with this chapter.  It's unfocused.  I can't break the rhythm of the switching viewpoints, so I absolutely can't break it down.

21:07.  I didn't only work on writing.  I played Liberal Crime Squad for a while tonight.  It left me feeling refreshed.  I'm a little too energized for 21:00.  Can I work with the way it made me feel?

21:26.  Lately I've been sleeping in, rather than hitting my ambitious morning wake-up target.  If Liberal Crime Squad makes me feel refreshed and energized, maybe I can work it into my self-improving inclinations by playing it early in the morning when a few minutes of LCS could prevent me from hours of slumber.

21:57.  30,411.  3,360 words of progress.  That's enough for tonight.  8.6 miles.  1,584 kcal.  32,264 steps.  7 hours, 19 minutes, 10 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.
