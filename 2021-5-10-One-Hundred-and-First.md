People who successfully coerced me and violated my rights also successfully treated me as empowered, chaotic, and inclined to violate the rights of others.

I don't know how much I value the Global Health course I've taken this semester.  More than not at all, I'd say; there's some intrinsic focus value in taking it.

People who are very localist are not very good at health policy.  Health effects are global.  The obvious example of this is in epidemiology, where contagious diseases rarely respect national borders.  Less obviously but still very real, health anywhere promotes the *information* of health everywhere.  If some cultures have the lowest rates of cardiac diseases, they teach the world how to have lower rates of cardiac diseases; likewise for other categories of noncommunicable disease.  As pressing burdens are lifted, resources become available for less pressing burdens, too.  In these ways health anywhere promotes health everywhere.

I think this course material focuses a bit overmuch on the developing world.  I do understand that they are the most deeply deprived and that their health is as important as everyone else's.  My issue is that I feel like the developed world has lost some amount of its verve and vivacity, and could use new thinking as well; our concept of good health has become a little too much like grimness and privation, and I'm not sure we're exporting good health very effectively as a result.
