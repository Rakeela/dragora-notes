People who successfully coerced me and violated my rights also successfully treated me as empowered, chaotic, and inclined to violate the rights of others.

I don't know how much I value the Global Health course I've taken this semester.  More than not at all, I'd say; there's some intrinsic focus value in taking it.

People who are very localist are not very good at health policy.  Health effects are global.  The obvious example of this is in epidemiology, where contagious diseases rarely respect national borders.  Less obviously but still very real, health anywhere promotes the *information* of health everywhere.  If some cultures have the lowest rates of cardiac diseases, they teach the world how to have lower rates of cardiac diseases; likewise for other categories of noncommunicable disease.  As pressing burdens are lifted, resources become available for less pressing burdens, too.  In these ways health anywhere promotes health everywhere.

I think this course material focuses a bit overmuch on the developing world.  I do understand that they are the most deeply deprived and that their health is as important as everyone else's.  My issue is that I feel like the developed world has lost some amount of its verve and vivacity, and could use new thinking as well; our concept of good health has become a little too much like grimness and privation, and I'm not sure we're exporting good health very effectively as a result.

I didn't eat for two days.  That was depressive reluctance to eat rather than health-maintaining fasting this time.  I set my fasting timer, but I didn't give it a target.  It just ticked upwards.

I broke my fast for a meal, because I was struggling badly with a math assignment, and Kistaro convinced me to.  Then I set the fasting timer again!  I'm considering trying alternate day fasting again.  It didn't work before; I discovered that I can quite happily eat two days worth of calories per day.  This time, I think that I'll try it with eating only one meal on the days where I'm "not fasting", so that the fasting timer will only be interrupted briefly.

I may have a fungal infection of my scalp.  I've had other scalp infections before, and I've previously had fungal infections of my armpits.  I think my immune system is fungal-tolerant in a way that may have saved my life as a kid (direct exposure to a highly toxic fungus without apparent consequence), but which has since predisposed me to profoundly annoying issues.

My weight loss efforts plateau'd hard when I got under 230 pounds.  For a while I was frustrated at it, and I slightly still am.  Yet I think I know why it happened.  I no longer 'feel' massive.  This is a threshold at which moving becomes easier, and the health benefits of continued weight loss start to feel more abstract.

New methods of dietary regulation should help.  I doubt I can eat two days worth of calories at one meal.

I'm disappointed in my health textbook for promoting abstinence and monogamy as risk-reducing behaviors.  Abstinence, especially; poly-friendly textbooks may still be too much to hope for, but abstinence education is not a successful thing AFAIK.
