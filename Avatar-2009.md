Date First Watched:  2023-01-21
Dates Rewatched:  Never

Today was supposed to be LotR, but a key individual couldn't be present to watch it today, so we're watching something else.  Famously, this is one of those movies where (supposedly) people killed themselves in despair because it's so much more beautiful than Earth.

Disabled lead?  What's the justification for a special case of a marine with a damaged spine?

Mixing human DNA with native DNA isn't easy.  I don't buy it.

Hmm.  Too many creatures with too many limbs.

Gotta love the ultra-gigantic tree shot there.  I have a soft spot for trees of unbelievable size.

Floating mountains?  Point of disbelief.  Bigger issue though, I don't really buy this storyline about killing the natives.

I didn't think they'd really take down the tree.

I guess that was okay.  Four stars.
