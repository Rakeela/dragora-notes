I have two lumps of keto cashew chocolate cooling in the fridge right now.  I don't know if they'll be good.  They don't look like abominations.  They taste good as a liquid.  I hope they DO actually set correctly.  In any case, I'm looking forward to trying them.

If I could transfer my horrible sweet tooth to home cooking, the health side effects would get significantly less awful.  I only cook keto dishes!  If I were cooking all of my own meals, there'd be little sugar in my diet.

They didn't set in the fridge.  So I moved them to the freezer, and they did.  I've sawed one of the two lumps in half to try it, and moved the remaining half-a-lump to the fridge to see if it melts in the fridge.

It's pretty good.  Tastes like cashew fudge.  Hard to believe this is keto.
