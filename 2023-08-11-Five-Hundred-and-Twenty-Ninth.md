8:58.  23,830.  23,898.  I worked a little before remembering to establish my first time point.

9:22.  24,056.  Going to make my daily check of the overstock supply at the local grocery store.

9:57.  I also picked up some medications for Kistaro.  No overstock peanut butter cookies, alas, but I did discover that Detroit-style pizzas are back in stock... for meat-lovers and double pepperoni fans only.  No non-meat variety was available.

11:25.  24,123.  I hit a stall point.  I should've taken a time point promptly, but I did not.  I played Cultist Simulator for a while, hoping to clear my mind and come back fresh.  When I came back, I still felt stalled.  Writing is difficult today.

11:37.  I'm so tired.  Laying down felt so good.  I'm not sleepy, just fatigued.  Staying on my treadmill is very hard.

11:44.  1,071 words on the chapter.

12:14.  24,125.  I changed something important!  Oh god, I'm still stalled.

12:17.  I'm so fatigued.  I got to bed on time last night.  Why am I so tired.

13:39.  At Kistaro's advising, I have attempted to remediate today's exhaustion and stress by taking a shower.  That was pleasant!

14:44.  Credit 3,040 words of editing on Kura and Kaire.

14:57.  24,637.  807 words of progress.  I thought I was making better progress than *that*.  I'm working over both stories to fix things, but my word count isn't tallying up much.

16:51.  2,345 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?  25,525.  1,695 words of progress.  So I do get to meet quota today.

18:53.  25,527.  I'm sitting on the start of the next chapter with bad blank page syndrome.  The story offers so many possibilities and I don't know what to pursue.

18:54.  How the hell was that two hours, anyways?  I didn't even load up a game.  I've just been futzing around on my computer and listening to music.

18:56.  I did write up something for a friend about why I'm hopeful for uploading within the next few decades.  That was only three paragraphs long, though.
