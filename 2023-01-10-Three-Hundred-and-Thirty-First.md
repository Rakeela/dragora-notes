I've decided that I won't fast this week... not exactly.  I'm going to eat fat and avoid carbs this week.  I've bought cheese.  I ate some last night, a little more this morning.  I ate an avocado today.  Avocado is pretty good, and it's still fat without carbs.

I feel pretty terrible, but not as bad as when I'm fasting.  I was craving carbohydrates earlier, but that passed.  My weight still dropped two pounds in a day, as though my glycogen stores were being depleted, even though my urination levels were not as high as they are in a total fast.

If I understand metabolism correctly, eating fats without carbs should keep my body in lipolysis.  Insulin is what triggers the storage of fat on the body.  Insulin releases can be kept brief and minimal by keeping carbohydrate consumption very low, so that my blood sugar levels are driven by gluconeogenesis in the liver rather than by absorption through the gut.

If this works, I may abandon vegetarianism to add simple meats back into my diet.  If I can lose weight on a meat and cheese diet, I'll do that, and return to vegetarianism when my weight is under control.

There's one big wrinkle in this dietary plan.  I don't like cheese.  If it works, there'll be another wrinkle.  I don't like meat.  I mean, meat is better than cheese, so the whole point of adding it back into the diet will be to make it less maddeningly unpalateable, but it's not great.

There's another wrinkle as well.  I take metformin.  Metformin interferes with gluconeogenesis.  I'm concerned about hypoglycemia.  Looking it up online, I find sources claiming that the risk of hypoglycemia with metformin is extremely low.
