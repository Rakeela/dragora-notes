# 2020-11-19-First

This is my first entry in this "agora".  I've just finished installing Foam according to the instructions on flancia.org/mine/roam-likes/.  I very much do not know what I'm doing.  Where should I link things together?  Is there some tool that will tell me when I've reused words so that I can hyperlink them to associate files?

I suppose I can start with a few details about what my life is like.  For instance, I'm writing this at 5:40 AM, but I haven't just gotten up.  I've been up all night.  My schedule has been busted for half of my life.  As a child I thought the problem was that I hated sleep (constant nightmares), but as an adult I can tell it's something else.  I think of it (technically inaccurately) as having an instinctually [[Martian]] schedule; without heroic efforts, I live on 26 hour days.

I'm obese, I have chronic fatigue, and I'm in near-perpetual pain.  My metabolism seems to run morbidly slowly and to have done so my entire life.  I've done the experiment to discover that I can gain weight on a 1400 calorie diet, and everything is more effortful than it should be.  I'm also arthritic.  I first developed the pains that I recognize in hindsight to have been arthritic pains when I was 7.  Research has shown that for most people, a positivity bias yields utility in an ongoing way (the basic default experience is good) as long as nothing is actively wrong.  I do not believe that I gain passive utility just by being alive.  Despite these problems, I am an immortalist.

I occasionally need to take supplementary potassium in order to be able to move.  I get a few minutes of prodromal weakness before actually suffering paralytic collapses.  Without potassium, I fall to a semiconscious state resembling slumber for 10-15 minutes, whereupon I regain mobility.  This problem has been medically observed to be real, but no cause has been identified.  I do not apparently have narcolepsy or any common potassium dysfunction.  This unusual problem is at its worst if I have to solve math problems under time pressure.  Taking a math test requires about 600mg of supplementary potassium in two doses, thirty minutes apart.  Someday, I would like to do a math test in an MRI machine, in order to see what's happening to my brain when this occurs.

My mind is very different in daytime and nighttime hours.  Some things are always the same (basic identity, ethical commitments, verbosity).  However, my mind doesn't work as well at night.  I'm prone to disruptive random fixations.  Temporary random fixations have occasionally been lucky, but I can't rely on them.  I also get nervous more easily at night, and I handle that more poorly when it happens.

Historically, I'm prone to picking up projects, fixating on them to the exclusion of all else for three days, then flaming out and spinning my wheels unproductively for periods that can span weeks.  I just stop being able to think about the same subject for a while.  Sometimes this is obviously because the project crashed in flashback city (thank you, awful childhood), while at other times I can't account for it.  A few of the longer periods of productive fixation ended, appallingly, because I got mocked or praised by the hackers who busted my privacy.

Oh yes, my privacy got busted, my notes got read, and the people who busted it were less than professional about it.  They ripped off my private pornography like I was ashamed of it, and treated me as a sex offender...  Thank my unconventional libido, my sexual ethics are actually unbroken.  Even though I've never figured out who broke my privacy, I've managed to chew out the perpetrators a few times by posting information directed at them in locations where I correctly estimated that I would be observed by the right parties.  I pointed out that I was under weird, awful social pressures to produce porn, that I resisted those pressures for years, and that I made frequent complaints (which were ignored) about how the social pressures in that environment were making me feel.  In general, the stalkertrash set were desperately trying to hold me responsible for crimes committed both under duress and against fictional targets.

Dreadfully, I think the most important rebuke I ever landed in that manner involved pointing out that there's nothing chaotic or unpredictable about my dropping projects when I'm reminded that they're being observed unlawfully.  I can't drive back the perpetrators, but they complained about my *inactivity*.  Sometimes they have *liked* my material... argh!  Those rare reminders that I can't push hackers out of my life induce a sense of helplessness, which destroys productivity as learned helplessness *tends to*.  When I pointed this out, the rate of  "helpful" reminders dropped.  Periodically since, when something unusually flagrant happened, I've authored the reminder again.  I wish I could say it stopped; better said, it is now rare.

My bad experiences with privacy violation contribute substantially to making it unclear if I will be able to commit to an agora with its open notes concept.  The agora concept is like a consensual version of something that was forced upon me by extensive privacy violations.  This would be me putting my notes into a public access cloud.  Historically, I can't work on projects if I'm being observed.  I don't know how much I will actually be able to think in public through this medium.  This may all very much fail due to that.

Recently, I've been trying a new strategy to cope with the periodic losses of focus by all causes intrinsic and malign.  What I have been doing is that I have adopted a deliberate and willful strategy of working chaotically through many projects.  I set up a coherent meta-project with many attack surfaces.  Even if I exhaust my ability to focus on a given angle or find myself driven off of it by emotional factors, I've found that I can browse through the many different loose ends dangling off the project to find something else that I can extend upon instead.  Giving myself two dozen loosely-related subjects to think about appears to be presently a winning strategy... or at least, it hasn't failed me yet.  I haven't completed anything notable since starting that strategy, but I also haven't abandoned any projects since then.



Since in theory, this is a repository of my own thoughts exposed and recorded, I should also include some details of who I am.  My identity factors are:
    * [[Atheist]]
    * [[Otherkin]]
    * [[Posthumanist]]
    * [[Luciferian]]
    * [[Pacifist]]
    * [[Immortalist]]
    * [[Intellectual]]

Came Christ to Earth, I would serve him willingly with my whole being, for the peace and liberation that he represents is the apex of my values.  Barring such a supernatural event, I do not worship.

Next daily:  [[2020-11-20-Second]].  I won't keep labeling them first, second, etc. for very long, but I'll do it for now.
