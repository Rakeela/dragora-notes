A springboard company is intended in some means to fund the founding of a different company.  I have no idea if this is proper "lingo" anywhere in particular; it's just how I think of one item in business planning.  I need a springboard for [[Otter-Labs]].

Kinds of springboard:
 - Sold for capital
 - Used to invest in the next company (is this legal?)
 - Used for personal income
