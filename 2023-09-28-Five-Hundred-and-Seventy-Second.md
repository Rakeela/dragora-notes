13:56.  53,211.

13:59.  53,296.  Going to check Nationstates.

15:42.  I finished up with Nationstates, then updated my #Candy-Vault with all my recent acquisitions.  Now I've poured myself a shot of peanut butter whiskey.  This stuff is too sweet and it tempts me to overconsume.  I am definitely not buying it again.

16:49.  I've been grappling with social media.  It's so overwhelming and difficult.  How do I make myself appealing to others?  Better question: how do I make my friends appealing to others?  Making myself appealing is 1x work.  Making my friends appealing is 3x or better.  I need to not just advertise myself, I need to advertise people around me, and build a social network graph of note.

17:26.  I'm still thinking about social media.  I've been promoting an old commission that I got!  I want to do this.  It's fun.  Even though I'm bad at socializing, it's interesting and fun.  The fantasy is not just of being popular, but of having popular friends.  I managed to secure an additional follower for an artist I admire.

17:57.  Being sociable isn't very productive, is it?  I wrote a several paragraph post for Royal Road's forum.  I was writing about using mental illness as a model for evil.

18:01.  It's hard to connect with people.  I feel like I have a tremendous deficit in the ability to do this.  It takes me a lot of effort to make small connections.

18:54.  54,484.  1,273 words of progress.  I feel a bit stuck and I wanted stop here, but I haven't met quota yet.

19:15.  54,896.  1,683 words on the chapter.  1,685 words of progress.  I want to end this chapter.  It's so short, but I think it's enough.

19:59.  54,898.  No, I did not work consistently since the last time point.  I stopped working and started eating.  I am currently eating a "cola-flavored" chocolate bar with popping rocks in it.  It's actually really good.

21:29.  55,707.  Ugh.  This writing has been bad.  So.  Little.  Description.  So little wonder.  Nothing to visualize.  Just a character lost in his head.  While flying over new terrain!  He should be in wonder of the terrain, not lost in his head!  2,496 words of progress.
