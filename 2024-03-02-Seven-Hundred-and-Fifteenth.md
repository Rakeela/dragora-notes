10:18.  I spent an hour and a half arguing with someone yesterday, and it disrupted my mood on into the morning.  But, I shook it while playing Nationstates, and now I've finished with that.  I've been on my treadmill for an hour and a half so far, but I've been up longer than that.  I thought I got up quite early, but...  I can't account for the time...  All I've done is either here or a brief trip to the grocery store.  I bought two donuts, but I'm embarking on my next fast.  We'll see how long I survive fasting this time.

19:07.  791 words on the chapter.  I haven't been productive for some time, so this hasn't been steady work; I'm still at 72,821 words on the file.  I'm just marking the chapter count to give myself a psychological goal.
