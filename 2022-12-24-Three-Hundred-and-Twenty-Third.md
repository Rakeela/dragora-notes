Wah, I don't want to work on my writing today.  But I've wasted hours not knowing what to do.  Bumming around feeling awful.  There's nothing I want to do more than write... even when I don't want to write very much.

I've been fantasizing about rebellions.  Peaceful rebellions.  Rebellions without troops or civil wars.  Uprisings from the edges of civilization using peaceful protest to enact change.  Harnessing collective resources to build a new way of doing things.

Can I write any of that in Theoma?  Who would rebel in Theoma?  It doesn't have a history of tyranny.  No slavers.  No genocidals.  Well, I was thinking of including a bit of political action in the next settlement.  A theome with democratically elected weather.  I was thinking that the rebel faction are the Winter Coalition.  They want to make their artificial weather into snow.  It's bad for the economy, so it never wins the election.

It seems very silly though, and I keep getting caught up in thinking, "How does a weather factory work?"  Even in a constrained area.  How does artificial weather generation proceed?  Maybe the Winter Coalition doesn't even know how to create snow in their giant weather-cavern.  Or have they figured out refrigeration in a thousand years of peaceful research?

This question comes up constantly in dealing with the deep-under.  They have advantages in mechanical research: cheaper metal and the work-source of myrghon gems.

1,523 words on the first file to be altered.  1,536 words on the file.  I think that's all I want to do with that file today.  13 words of progress.  No wait, I'm not making that change.  1,523 words on the file.  0 words of progress.

Starting on a fresh file.  Today's target is 210 words, which is to say that if I write 210 words every day until the end of the month, I'll end up finishing a total of 30k in December.

309 words.  I'm so averse to writing right now that it's tempting to turn it in... and there.  It's turned in, but I'll keep thinking about this.  This is probably not all the writing that I'll do today.

I made a mistake mentioning slavers earlier.  I've toyed with slaver fantasies before in the past.  Slavery is a morbidly awful practice that was never done beneficially in the real world, but paternalistic justifications always showed up.  What if somehow that was real?  Could the slaves own nothing and be happy?

I don't think I'll ever include slavery in Theoma.  There's already little enough work to be done in the setting, in the absence of war and with all the blessings that the land gods bestow.  Slavery would do nothing but pad the egos of slave-owners.

1,077 words on the file.  768 words of progress on my second session.  I'll turn this in, too.  I may still do more.  I remain disappointed with my lack of proximity to the end.  I'm 603 words from the end of my December goal, but I'm more than 603 words to the end of the story.  I'll have to edit for brevity when I'm done.  My third manuscript feels discouragingly far from being ready.

My second manuscript is the one that feels closest to ready.
