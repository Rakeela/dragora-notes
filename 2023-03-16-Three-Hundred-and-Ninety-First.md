Morning weigh-in: 243.8 pounds

I ate two candy bars last night and another one this morning, breaking my diet.  I'm going to try to return to it immediately.  I've noticed a correlation between the deliciousness of foods and their usefulness to a diet.  It's not perfect - one of the candy bars I ate last night was both disappointing AND bad for my diet - but the useful foods are a little like penances.  Eating raw veggies is a little like penance, and it's a little useful for dieting.  Eating cheese is a lot like penance, and it's very useful for dieting.

The snack dips that I've been eating are in a similar penance level as raw veggies.  If I were a veggie-fanatic I would totally mix the dips with veggies, but I think vegetables provide too many carbohydrates.

I have broken my record for before-noon walking with over 2 hours and 15 minutes marked as I approach noon.  I haven't been going exceptionally fast, but a third of it was at 2.1 mph.  I would like to get to the point of exceptional endurance at the 2.1 mph pace.

Evening weigh-in:  242.6 pound

Today was a bit food-fixated.  I ended up eating a fair bit of keto-okay stuff in addition to the candy bar this morning.  It's weird to me that my weight is down between the evening weigh-in and the morning weigh-in.  I feel like I ate half a pound of cheese, heh.

I walked another 1.1 miles, taking an additional 4,395 steps, burning an estimated 216 kcal.  I walked for 1 hour and 1 second, at a speed of 1.1 mph.  I had the treadmill set at 1.2 mph the entire time.  It seems to run 0.1 mph slower than its set at.
