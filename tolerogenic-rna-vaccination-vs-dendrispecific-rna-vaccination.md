# Tolerogenic RNA Vaccination Vs Dendrispecific RNA Vaccination

First Draft:
    In reviewing current technologies for RNA vaccination, I have discovered two distinct varieties that are being pursued in research: tolerogenic RNA vaccination and hypercompetent RNA vaccination.  Both of them offer exciting new potentials for medical immunoresponse tuning.  Tolerogenic RNA vaccination uses dendritic cells matured in culture which have been modified to present antigenic surfaces in a tolerogenic mode, thereby reducing immunoresponse to specific antigens chosen by the doctor overseeing the work.  Hypercompetent RNA vaccinations meanwhile deliver antigenic surfaces in a form that dendritic cells specifically are most competent to absorb.  This heightened specificity for dendritic cells leads to increases in the quality and quantity of helpful IgG antibodies that the body is producing, while reducing the number of frequently destructive IgE (eosinophilic) antibodies produced.
    Current vaccine technologies rely on the delivery of antigenic particles to the bloodstream, there to be reacted to by the immune system.  Mild inflammation at the site of the vaccination is normal, as is some amount of subclinical illness in the ensuing days.  The antigenic particles are broken down by immunorespones, and they're presented to the immune system to provide it with future sensitization against the specific threat vs which the vaccine is trying to teach it to guard.  Conventional vaccines distribute antigenic surfaces to the immune system in a distribution analogous to actual pathogenic distribution of antigenic surfaces.  This typically leads to upregulation of both IgG and IgE responses by the immune system.  Although the IgE response is dangerous to the body, it is adaptive when it reacts swiftly in small regions, and thus the immunoresponse of a vaccinated person is considerably more competent for the benefit of pretraining which vaccines provide it.
    Addressing hypercompetent RNA vaccinations first therefore in their position as a refinement of current vaccination technologies, the delivery of lipid-encapsulated mRNA (micro-RNA) instructions for antigenic surfaces rather than particles with antigenic surfaces is a fundamentally similar process which primes the immune system by the same primary mechanism.  It does so, and I call it 'hypercompetent', because it is an advance in cellular specificity.  The mRNA lipid capsules are less aggravating to other cells than the antigenic particles.  If they push up against a cell, it will passively take up the capsule, produce one instance of the antigenic surface, and rip up the mRNA in doing so.  Only dendrites are particularly drawn to the mRNA lipid capsules, absorbing the mRNA capsules more readily than other cells and then expressing their contents as antigens for presentation.  They even phagocytose antigens from the membranes of other cells for antigen presentation processing.  Something about this high specificity for dendritic cells and/or low cellular stress environment for antigen processing seems to bias the immunoresponse towards producing variants of Immunoglobin G (IgG) instead of Immunoglobin E (IgE).  Having more antigen-specific variants of IgG available in a greater quantity improves the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens (including allergens) in an effective yet only mildly inflammatory way, this being significantly less injurious to the body than the IgE responses which are downregulated by hypercompetent RNA vaccinations.
    Tolerogenic RNA vaccinations are a more complex process necessitating individualization and several manufacturing steps, but they expand the scope of RNA vaccination to immunoresponse tuning over the body's tendency to become misprimed towards its own tissues by infection, genetics, or entropy.  Tolerogenic RNA vaccinations are produced by extracting immature dendrites from a patient to be treated, using siRNA (silencer RNA) to strip those dendrites of their ability to signal hostile responses, and then maturing them in an environment laden with capsules encoding antigenic surfaces for allergenic or arthritogenic antigen surfaces for which it would be desirable to teach the immune system non-responsiveness.  The resulting treated dendrite population is something of an immunohazard, as it will now signal for whatever antigens it picks up to be *tolerated*, but they will enter the immune system loaded primarily with antigens for self-or-harmless structures, and will not be conserved as a replicating population due to the monogenerational nature of siRNA cellular modifications.  This temporary period of relative immune vulnerability will be followed by subsequent improvements in immunoregulation of the body which may have antisenescent properties through eliminating persistent long-term inflammatory responses.  Immunoresponse mistraining is historically incurable, and as a sufferer of chronic pain, I confess to a certain conflict of interest when I say that this application should be researched with haste.
    Both hypercompetent RNA vaccination and tolerogenic RNA vaccination are extremely promising fields of medical research which should be empowered if possible.  Hypercompetent RNA vaccination technologies are nearer to deployment, for the COVID-19 vaccine has been declared to the public as what I would here classify as a hypercompetent RNA vaccine, yet I believe that investments in rolling out tolerogenic RNA vaccination research would achieve major benefits in public cohesion by improving society's ability to balance the objectives of productivity and public happiness.  People wouldn't have to work harder to achieve more in a world with better immunoresponse tuning.  Their productivity just wouldn't be impaired as often by aches, pains, and petty confusions.  It would extend the 'summer' of life by pushing back cumulative errors in the immune system for which nature invented no cure.

Seeing it in text like this, I immediately feel that I may want to revise 'hypercompetent' to 'dendrispecific', since the primary current RNA vaccination technology (as used for COVID-19, and as proposed in the research I've studied for the treatment of pollen allergies) is *primarily* advantaged in which immune cells are most responsive to it.

The identification of specific claims in the essay will provide a new essay-specific source of structure for my investigation of the available medical research.  Not all claims in the draft are necessarily true.  Some will likely be struck down in future drafts; others replaced or extended.

I wonder if you could encapsulate RNA in a THC capsule and provide treatments via vaporizer.  THC gets into the bloodstream and eventually accumulates in fatty tissue; could it structurally survive being absorbed in a complex shape?  That might modify fat cells specifically if so.  Although if it didn't work as an infiltrant, would inhalation be usable as a method of modifying lung cells with RNA?  Since neither modifies immune cells, this is off-topic thought for thoughts of vaccines, but these thoughts arose when I typed 'lipid-encapsulated mRNA' above.  I lack the knowledge to know if this is a foolish contemplation.  Don't try it on a sapient first...

I'm grateful that my school experience this semester has taught me how to value writing essays in a new and greater way.

I need to specify in the essay that I'm inventing and attempting to introduce the terms 'tolerogenic RNA vaccination' and 'hypercompetent RNA vaccination'.  For that matter, I need to decide if the 'hypercompetent RNA vaccinations' are actually 'dendrispecific RNA vaccinations', as I think would be more technically accurate should there be a pathogen someday for which RNA vaccination is not optimal.  This could for instance conceivably apply to vaccinations targeting multicellular parasites, as in that case IgE activation *is* appropriate and IgG-biased activation patterns would *not* be more effective.  So I think this is going to get a second draft pretty quickly for turning up flaws immediately on review.

I'm looking forward to establishing the dendrispecific quality, as I believe that may be an ambitious extension to the currently available information on the subject.  Given what I have observed of the status quo in my recent searches, I believe I will have to establish that by logical inference from observations in the data, as I have not thus far seen specific dendrispecificity praise for RNA vaccinations.  I am generating that de noveau and I intend to establish it as fact.  Presuming, of course, that it is an actual fact observed in experiments performed thus far.

My husband has told me that the work that I'm presently doing to try to draw new information from existing research is a "Review" in science.  He says that's the kind of paper I'm writing now.  (He also said things about scientific meta-analyses that I didn't follow at the time, but I've decided to record it in a 'this topic came up' sort of way.)

Second Draft:
    In reviewing current technologies for RNA vaccination, I have discovered two distinct varieties that are being pursued in research: tolerogenic RNA vaccination and dendrispecific RNA vaccination.

This heightened specificity for dendritic cells leads to increases in the quality and quantity of helpful IgG antibodies that the body is producing, while reducing the number of frequently destructive IgE (eosinophilic) antibodies produced.  These terms 'tolerogenic' and 'dendrispecific' are of my invention and I am authoring this to propose their addition to the literature and classification methods presently used for researching RNA vaccinations.

I initially labeled this process 'hypercompetent RNA vaccination', because it is an advance in cellular specificity which further improves the quality of the immunoresponse that it precipitates from that base competency advantage which conventional vaccines enable.  
    Tolerogenic RNA vaccinations are a more complex process necessitating individualization and several manufacturing steps, but they expand the scope of RNA vaccination to immunoresponse tuning with the potential to control the immune system's tendency to become misprimed towards its own tissues as a result of infections, genetics, or entropy.

The resulting treated dendrite population is something of an immunohazard, as it will now signal for any antigenic surface that it processes to be *tolerated*, but this danger is mitigated by separate culturing as the dendrites will enter the immune system loaded primarily with antigens for self-or-harmless structures, and will not be conserved as a replicating population due to the monogenerational nature of siRNA cellular modifications.  This temporary period of relative immune vulnerability will be followed by subsequent improvements in immunoregulation of the body which may have antisenescent properties through eliminating persistent long-term inflammatory responses.
