One of the problems IRL that nobody ever likes to acknowledge is that honest liberals breed like honest conservatives, and both groups breed like old Quakers (a prudish group in America's history whose antisexual morality was so unusually sincere that they died out).  Liberals are more reliably honest than conservatives, but that means conservative false morality tends to outbreed honest ethical advancement.  Most conservatives would never tolerate anyone doing the right thing if doing the right thing didn't *look* conservative; they prize the semblance of virtue more than integrity!  This is the primary impediment to sexual ethics on Earth.  Good sexual ethics as best as I have been able to determine amount to sex-positive antinatalism.  It's depressing to me as an immortality-seeker to know that I'm trying to preserve *this* world, but on the other hand, there are an awful lot of honest liberals in the world RIGHT NOW.  Even if the cause of immortality is getting *worse* over time, it's still *good*.  There's time to save a billion honest liberals if the research moves at the speed of its potential.

I experience excess obviousness and excess unclarity both.  There's an unknown number of deeply abusive people who hate me because I'm "convinced" that they're evil and I "hate" them.  They're "reciprocating" my hatred.  Meanwhile, I don't hate anyone and I believe very strongly in the redeemability of all people.  The things which seem really obvious to me, and the things which other people think are really obvious to me, are not at all related to each other.  My certainties and uncertainties are consistently misunderstood and always have been.

I'm smart, but in a way that is difficult to understand.  I understand a lot of things, and indeed I've already changed the technological history of humanity!  Just... don't expect me to have gotten any credit, because so far I haven't.  I've engaged in ways that made it difficult (though I would argue not impossible) to credit me for my ideas.  I've caught a lot of punishment from people desperate to punish "liars" - they've been uniformly dishonest and corrupted people, ironically.  I'm never gonna stop tweaking them by being honest in ways that enrage them.  Truth IS the highest power!

I'm under the impression that some of the credit which could have accrued to me was withheld intentionally based on an impression that I was a rape-crazy hypernatalist who would use the credit to pick up molestables or something.  Thanks, liferuin campaign by stalking authoritarian leftists!  I'm so glad I spent years providing sexual services to your cult!  Fascism was such a wonderful look for you!  Hatred is totally left-aligned and liberating, right?  Well, no.  Not really.  I'm pretty sure that the obvious-to-me consequences of authoritarian structuring were not at all pleasant to leftists who got to watch public fascism rise against them when they dabbled in tactics on that side of the consent line.  Calling out authoritarian leftism - despite my having an extraordinarily good personal reason - was one of those things that got me "reciprocally" hated by others.  Opposing authoritarianism doesn't make me hostile to liberals, and it never did.  I *am* a liberal, and since "I wish I'd met more liberal people" stands atop my list of ways that I wish my childhood had been different, I'm never giving that up.  Like Kestenan told me, I should be who my childhood self needed!  I know that everyone wants to protect their own autonomy, too.  Full reciprocity involves being to others as we wish they would be to us, and that includes protecting the autonomy of others as we wish empowered individuals would protect our own autonomy.

I'm distinctly irritated by the harshness of primitive illiberal medicine, too.  Full-fledged commitment to morphological freedom would have lead to dramatically faster medical progress in the last several decades while being much more polite and productive.  I *tried* to make those connections as a kid to get into that.  I wish that my tech-savvy "friends" had funneled me towards research instead of sex work.  I trusted them an awful lot to bring about the future I wanted when they treated me as extraneous and encouraged me to "just wait, things will get better" as a strategy.  They encouraged me to make dragon porn instead.  That was not very productive.

Well, those were the transhumanists of two decades ago now, and instead of body-reshaping advances that would have actually solved issues, we got two decades of otherwise intelligent people generally screaming at people and abusing them for their "ignorance".  Because you know, apparently medical advocates never have kids, and nobody involved in promoting health has any idea what happens when you try to force people to do your bidding at scream-point.  Getting more discrete doesn't make that attitude incompetent, either.  My stats course this semester is ostensibly polite, but it's a gem of simplistic exercises and poorly concealed hatreds like a lot of the emotionally incompetent authoritarian materials that have made such a mess of our culture.  The book claims to be about statistics in the life sciences, but it seems to be about how everyone is sick because they're statistically incompetent.  That is not only wrong, it's the exact kind of "subtle" hostility that *created* the status quo in public health.  The material in the book is not difficult, but if this is how stats is presented, it makes sense to me that most people are statistically incompetent.  Systems need to be respectful and empowering if you want people to do the right thing voluntarily.  No sideswipes.  Don't even fixate on "related materials that the public needs to know" when producing educational materials, because human societies often have those judgments being made by hostile people whose attitude is sabotaging the actual competency of the public.  Stick to the skills and make the exercises anodyne.

The sex criminal caste drawn to watching others and violating them (all privacy violations are sex crimes, IMO) never seem to understand the importance of that.  They're so extraordinarily drawn to discretion that their minds shatter, blocking them from honestly accounting for their activities.  That's how they "have" to be for their jobs, because "everyone lies" and "what is buried is true".  Discretion doesn't make people like that less hateful; it makes them *more* hateful by making rational engagement with hatred impossible for them, while sapping their emotional competency to apologize and atone when they make errors.  (Everyone makes errors!)  People who "never" make mistakes about what they "know" are dangerous; indeed, they're a specific kind of dangerous that was fabricated as supposedly a reason to consider *me* dangerous!  The sad thing is, that crowd is unusually likely to both have kids and victimize them.  Having a police officer as a parent is statistically unlucky.  The people who are most intrusive on others are expressing a criminal inclination themselves and it is frequently accompanied by a bunch of other social pathologies.

Meanwhile, I myself have been and remain fundamentally lawful!  I live within the aegis of the law, flawed though its implementation may be, and legalism has been a tool for me against the antagonism that my life has inspired.  I will never yield pacifism!  Indeed, part of why I reach so high in my ambitions is because of just how much has been denied me due to unlawful activities against me, some of that occurring from people in positions of trust.  Not only do I oppose that, I still want to change *everything*.  I want to save everyone and enable every future.  I long for a peaceful forever!

By no means am I intending to try to conquer the world outright, but if I ever someday *owned* this world, I'm pretty sure I would still think of myself as someone who owns nothing at all.
