One of the problems IRL that nobody ever likes to acknowledge is that honest liberals breed like honest conservatives, and both groups breed like old Quakers (a prudish group in America's history whose antisexual morality was so unusually sincere that they died out).  Liberals are more reliably honest than conservatives, but that means conservative false morality tends to outbreed honest ethical advancement.  Most conservatives would never tolerate anyone doing the right thing if doing the right thing didn't *look* conservative; they prize the semblance of virtue more than integrity!  This is the primary impediment to sexual ethics on Earth.  Good sexual ethics as best as I have been able to determine amount to sex-positive antinatalism.  It's depressing to me as an immortality-seeker to know that I'm trying to preserve *this* world, but on the other hand, there are an awful lot of honest liberals in the world RIGHT NOW.  Even if the cause of immortality is getting *worse* over time, it's still *good*.  There's time to save a billion honest liberals if the research moves at the speed of its potential.
