I'm normally all for animation, but I'm skeptical that a Mass Effect animated movie will actually be any good.  This setting got overworked and they didn't stick to some of the decisions that made the first game great.

The whole Reaper-Collectors thing was a bad idea in this fiction.  Reapers made out of captured DNA?  That is garbage nonsense and it doesn't require capturing entire colonies to achieve.  I see it as a big mistake that really damaged the series to me.

Disliking Mass Effect makes this hard to enjoy.

I don't respect the material enough to appreciate the tearjerker ending.
