#My-Nationstates-Nations

Committing to total transparency on this is difficult.  The Nationstates site is stalked by malfeasant actors and I've read rumor that it has a lot of fascists playing it, too.  I've thought of it as "Nazi Sim" before, because it promulgates such an ignorant, swinging-to-extremes model of political action.

I might make these links to their own cards eventually, but for the moment I'm just going to give them a brief introduction.

My current puppets are:
* Steelfeather Rapture 1:  The first Steelfeather Rapture.  Originally intended to take the lawful, liberal, and bureaucratic faction from Polis Diamonil and imagine their actions in an environment of infinite reincarnation with memories intact.  I think of this as "New Diamonil" and it has taken on the panoply of peacock gryphon culture... with one exception.  It is ideologically dominated by the search for "harmless charmless" people who, although unpopular with tourists, are not harmful of themselves.
* Steelfeather Rapture 2:  The second Steelfeather Rapture.  Originally intended to take a hardcore anti-black-market faction from Polis Diamonil and then set them to eternal reincarnation.  They are the most liberal of all my puppets, at 100% civil rights.
* Wind and Void Rapture 1:  Reincarnated from the Wind and Void faction, the gryphons of WVR1 are religiously tolerant but determinedly secular.
* Inclusive Conservatives 1:  Intended to never fail inclusivity, I've mucked up a few times while playing this one.  They hate civil rights and want a population of conservatives.  They also want a population that is inclusive of all people.
* Camp Mennihackatorso:  Modeled after one of the punishments in the game Afterlife, Mennihackatorso is my only 'hell' realm.  The motto is, "You Must Go Into the Woods" and the nation is determinedly environmentalist in the extreme.  It'll take nearly any tradeoff to be more environmentally friendly.  Despite this, it only uses environmentalist actions at most every other day, and uses its "off" days to try to build the worst possible government without being rude.
* Therimenjas:  My rudest nation, it nevertheless opposes rudeness... ineffectually.  It opposes crime ineffectually, too.  Therimenjas is very anti-cop.  Narratively, Therimenjas is supposed to be run by a questionable AI called KOT-OS3 as well as by the AI programmers collectively known as "The Solar Riot Consortium".  This is my oldest nation, the only survivor from a past generation of puppets whose natures I do not currently plan to elucidate here.
* Honest Economic Planners 1:  This is the new puppet that I am creating which I feared I would forget.  It is intended to be an iron fist socialist state that tries to develop integrity without developing political freedoms.arr
