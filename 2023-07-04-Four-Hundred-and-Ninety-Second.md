13:42.  I've done almost no writing so far today.  I was so tired this morning that I had trouble getting out of bed.  Credit 3,172 words of editing.

17:10.  47,941.  47,976.  I initially forgot to record my starting tally, so my first time point involves a few words.  It's hard to think through the next step.  I'm not at all sure of what I've written.

18:33.  48,430.  1,671 words on the chapter.

18:50.  My favorite line from the Goodbye Volcano High demo is when Reed says, "You're above an inside, on the outside.  It's awesome."  That is the insight of the ages and I love it.

20:17.  48,516.  575 words of progress.

22:18.  48,633.  692 words of progress.  This is all I'll do tonight.  I didn't work throughout the last two hours.  I did other stuff.  I showered, I watched an episode of The Ancient Magus Bride.  I talked to Kistaro about inks and papers.
