Got a dentist appointment today... and I shaved off my beard.  Largest it had ever gotten.  I hate facial hair, but I hate interacting with it, so it grows.  Anyways.  Dentist appointment.  I think my gums are receding.

Starting the day with 92,361 words on the draft and 11,574 words left on the redraft project.

92,304 words on the draft.  92,110 words on the draft.  92,082 words on the draft.  Chapter split.   92,027 words on the draft.  What a grind!  334 words removed; 11,240 words to go.

Another chapter split.  91,929 words on the draft.  I didn't want to remove words on this section.  I liked most of the words where they were.  90 words removed; 11,142 words to go.

Ugh.  I've hit a section that's likely to need rewriting.  It's demoralizing.  It reminds me of what I was trying and failing to do with this story, and of what's wrong with Ekis' voice.  Anyways.  91,745 words on the draft.  184 words removed; 10,958 to go.

Chapter split.  Scene rewritten.  Very slightly longer, but considerably better.  91,757 words on the draft.  2 words added; 10,960 to go.

Another chapter edited.  91,396 words on the draft.  361 words removed; 10,599 to go.

I'm several chapters and 975 words further into the editing project.  I had to do some rewriting on those chapters and I'm not sure I'm done with them.  I'm not sure that I can hit 15k like this.  I may have to change the story more ambitiously to get my draft down 15k words.  This project may continue into the third draft.

91,371 words on the draft.  This next chapter is oversized and annoying.  I can't reduce it adequately just by cutting content.  It will need to be split at least one more time and possibly twice.  91,107 words on the draft.  I want to stop for the day.  289 words removed; 10,310 to go.

As revolting as this is, I may want it in my records.  I had loose bowels on Tuesday, but I haven't had a bowel movement since.  I am disturbed.
