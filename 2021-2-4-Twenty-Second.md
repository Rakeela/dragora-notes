As a child, I wanted to be a politician, or at least a politician's speechwriter.  I was an essayist, quite voluntarily.  I wrote out some of my complaints and some of my ideals as finely as I could, both at the level of the school and at the level of the world.  I believed in one world governance under a system of egalitarian capitalism.  I was an environmentalist and a transhumanist who believed that the whole system of Earth could be transformed for the better.

Unfortunately, politics had no use for those skills and ideals save sex work.  It's not that I'm pretty, but that I used to write porn, until my privacy got raped by the people who molested me for years in this way.  I eventually stopped being willing to use my literate talents in that way... especially since nobody was *paying* in anything but vague promises of better conditions someday.  Now AI Dungeon exists to provide a service that I used to.

I got stalked for being "a far right infiltrator," "violently unstable," "a rapist," and "a lying slut".  My civil rights were shredded because of these crimes that I didn't commit.  I'm asexual as far as any human needs to care; humans aren't hot to me.  I'm a pacifist and have been all my life.  The supposed liberal order proved when tested to be controlled by the dear and determined conservation of what is historically evil, and the promise of technology was being shat upon by people desperate to use it in defense of the safety of evil.

Given that background, I wasn't surprised to read of a criminal conspiracy probe being opened by India against Greta Thunberg.  As I understand the state of the world, Hollywood has been taken over by an illiberal clique who are hostile to all integrity and determined to use technology in defense of unearned privileges.  People like that have ruled for most of history.  They were out of power for a scant few years, but seized it once again.  I expect Greta Thunberg to be yet another lockstep loyalist of a conservative regime dulling humanity's progressive potentials.  We could've had a liberal democracy if we hadn't given the heights of culture to authoritarianism.  Now we won't have a liberal democracy ever again unless we can rout fascists using liberalism as a false face in high places.  I hope India can prove its case well.

No revolutionary am I.  I'm a pacifist transhumanist.  I have no idea how to change power structures in the way that I wish they would be changed.  The structure of government that we have already was wholly capable of wasting my potential for petty hedonism though I then *already* longed to see the immortality of all people, and when it was bored of me it had the power to dispose of me under false pretenses.  I am trying to reclaim my scientific potential though my civil rights *remain* in a shredded state with no true privacy given to me by the stalking rape culture that we have exalted into power.

I was called a fake nerd, one of that inclination which has ruled throughout history, but I would never do to another what was done to me.  There is no height of power or assurance of safety which would yield that behavior, nor even any derangement of my ethics; I am not *making* an ethical claim when I say that I would not perform the other side of what was done to me.  That is for the simple selfish reason that it would not be *hedonic* to me.  Judged by my joys alone I would still publish exposures of wrongdoing with succinct and well-formed evidences, taking great risks in the process.  Yet I have no evidence; I was shut out and driven away by those who are less ethical than I, who cannot value integrity and science above *text-based pornography featuring inhuman characters*.  We are governed by such madmen and simpletons that I have not yet been convinced we could not achieve a better government by replacing them with a random draw of the public!

I am a strange person who cannot be unknown.  It is not that I would not accept being unknown, it is something about my personality.  I do not know what causes this effect, but my foremost candidate is this: wherever I am, there are traces of my presence; whoever I have met, I am inclined to tell the world.

People who rely on deceitful separation find me as their antithesis, as I leave too many traces to be *un*-known, which is to say to have the known status revoked.  Those who rely on honest separation have no trouble out of me, as such people do not hinge their reputation on the ability to revoke the known status, and I am not actually pursuing any other person.  I consider myself someone reliant on the faculty of honest separation, and I tend to invoke 'the prayer of separate rewards', which goes like this, "May those who harmed me find paradise far away from me."  It's part of why I want to move off-world, too.  That would let me find what I believe to be the route of *my* paradise far away from the more earthbound souls who troubled me.
