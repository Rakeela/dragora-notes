As a child, I wanted to be a politician, or at least a politician's speechwriter.  I was an essayist, quite voluntarily.  I wrote out some of my complaints and some of my ideals as finely as I could, both at the level of the school and at the level of the world.  I believed in one world governance under a system of egalitarian capitalism.  I was an environmentalist and a transhumanist who believed that the whole system of Earth could be transformed for the better.

Unfortunately, politics had no use for those skills and ideals save sex work.  It's not that I'm pretty, but that I used to write porn, until my privacy got raped by the people who molested me for years in this way.  I eventually stopped being willing to use my literate talents in that way... especially since nobody was *paying* in anything but vague promises of better conditions someday.  Now AI Dungeon exists to provide a service that I used to.

I got stalked for being "a far right infiltrator," "violently unstable," "a rapist," and "a lying slut".  My civil rights were shredded because of these crimes that I didn't commit.  I'm asexual as far as any human needs to care; humans aren't hot to me.  I'm a pacifist and have been all my life.  The supposed liberal order proved when tested to be controlled by the dear and determined conservation of what is historically evil, and the promise of technology was being shat upon by people desperate to use it in defense of the safety of evil.

Given that background, I wasn't surprised to read of a criminal conspiracy probe being opened by India against Greta Thunberg.  As I understand the state of the world, Hollywood has been taken over by an illiberal clique who are hostile to all integrity and determined to use technology in defense of unearned privileges.  People like that have ruled for most of history.  They were out of power for a scant few years, but seized it once again.  I expect Greta Thunberg to be yet another lockstep loyalist of a conservative regime dulling humanity's progressive potentials.  We could've had a liberal democracy if we hadn't given the heights of culture to authoritarianism.  Now we won't have a liberal democracy ever again unless we can rout fascists using liberalism as a false face in high places.  I hope India can prove its case well.

No revolutionary am I.  I'm a pacifist transhumanist.  I have no idea how to change power structures in the way that I wish they would be changed.  The structure of government that we have already was wholly capable of wasting my potential for petty hedonism though I then *already* longed to see the immortality of all people, and when it was bored of me it had the power to dispose of me under false pretenses.  I am trying to reclaim my scientific potential though my civil rights *remain* in a shredded state with no true privacy given to me by the stalking rape culture that we have exalted into power.

I was called a fake nerd, one of that inclination which has ruled throughout history, but I would never do to another what was done to me.  There is no height of power or assurance of safety which would yield that behavior, nor even any derangement of my ethics; I am not *making* an ethical claim when I say that I would not perform the other side of what was done to me.  That is for the simple selfish reason that it would not be *hedonic* to me.  Judged by my joys alone I would still publish exposures of wrongdoing with succinct and well-formed evidences, taking great risks in the process.  Yet I have no evidence; I was shut out and driven away by those who are less ethical than I, who cannot value integrity and science above *text-based pornography featuring inhuman characters*.  We are governed by such madmen and simpletons that I have not yet been convinced we could not achieve a better government by replacing them with a random draw of the public!

I am a strange person who cannot be unknown.  It is not that I would not accept being unknown, it is something about my personality.  I do not know what causes this effect, but my foremost candidate is this: wherever I am, there are traces of my presence; whoever I have met, I am inclined to tell the world.

People who rely on deceitful separation find me as their antithesis, as I leave too many traces to be *un*-known, which is to say to have the known status revoked.  Those who rely on honest separation have no trouble out of me, as such people do not hinge their reputation on the ability to revoke the known status, and I am not actually pursuing any other person.  I consider myself someone reliant on the faculty of honest separation, and I tend to invoke 'the prayer of separate rewards', which goes like this, "May those who harmed me find paradise far away from me."  It's part of why I want to move off-world, too.  That would let me find what I believe to be the route of *my* paradise far away from the more earthbound souls who troubled me.

I have been a wrongthinker by default for most of my history, which is absurd, as I have also been obedient in ways most people would not.  It is a paradox of noncompliant compliance.  I have pushed people who rely on their status as defenders of the noncompliant to curse me for my noncompliance to *their* wishes.  And so I found "liberals" who were not... and I have found people who believed they supported transhumanism, confronted with *their own* sins against it, labeled as my sins.  Well, I wish only apologies and separations, though I will never let go of my history.

The people I call stalkertrash need to mature enough that they stop splintering their minds with conducts that they can't admit to.  If they do that, they can be more like me, and like me they can become people whose known state cannot be revoked.  I don't believe that this is a method only available to me, and I think that sexual ethics on Earth would improve if more people were willing and able to do what I do in that respect.  I made enemies who rely on concealment, who tried and failed to fabricate concealment around me so that they could present me as relying upon concealment!  I am not a safe and healthy prey for that tactic, as I do not rely upon concealment at all.

What is okay to do to a crow species that is going extinct is a very severe consent violation to do to humans, analogous to rape in its disrespect for their rights.

This is a thought brought up by looking at how conservation efforts aimed at Mariana Crows have proceeded on the island of Rota.  Ubiquitous surveillance to monitor predators and crow nests.  It would be pure rape culture to do that to humans.

Yet at the same time I have to wonder if ecologists have stopped any killings of humans, incidentally.  Just by having the equipment out there, not a jot of it intentionally aimed at any human, but known to the public to exist.  A forest that may or may not be surveiled at any given point, such that no human can readily guess exactly where any particular piece of the equipment is if they haven't studied the land just like an ecologist would.  I bet researchers would tend to turn material of potential criminal relevance over very readily...

I'm of two minds about sensors in communities.  I don't think universal oversight is safe, sane, and consensual, but I think that there should exist a FEW totally monitored cities per human-colonized planet.  Visiting them should always only ever be optional, even to criminals.  They should exist to give people the chance to opt-in to a total-visibility society.

I actually think there should be lots of different 'levels' of community in this sense.  One recurrent attraction to me in fiction, something that I've played with ever since I first installed one while playing Civ: Call to Power, is a mind controlled city.  Exactly one mind controlled city in a faction encompassing many cities.  Why should exactly one city exist under mind control?  Because you have to have a thing to have the countermeasures to a thing.  It's a sacrifice, and another example of an opt-in, like the all-watch cities but moreso, the next level past them.  The mind-controlled city is the thing that we'd really only want one of, per human-colonized solar system, because that would provide the whole true value of the mind-controlled city while soaking up all the people that would really be comfortable living in it.  I don't think all-watched cities would be comfortable either, but I'd still say humanity would need a handful of them to accommodate likely public demand.  The one mind-control city should of course be specialized in researching mind control...  I tend to imagine it as a paradise of evil social scientists.

On the other end, there should be other cities at other levels of oversight.  Indeed, tiers of different oversight levels with demarcated boundaries.  I take what might be aptly summed a panarchic attitude to this, borrowing from the concepts of the lore of [[The Viceroy]].  The lowest level is constructed as considered minimal for maintenance of society (psuedoanarchic); the highest level as is considered destructive to society by sheer excess (the city of mind control).  In between, a gradient, with my expectation being that the actual optima would exist in the third or fourth tier of oversight.

All possible technologies must be given at least enough expression to discern their countermeasures, societal or otherwise.  This is due to the basic inexorability of science.  If science is not pursued for good causes, it will be pursued for evil causes.  Since I believe that future mind-machine interface technologies will eventually exist at a high level, I consider defining and defending cognitive freedom to be something that requires a little foresight around its potential threats.  Far from being a place where none may stir their voice in defense of cognitive freedom, I expect that the city of mind control would be largely populated by cognitive freedom's defenders.  Who else would dedicate their lives to researching its defense?

Whether that's a trap or a bastion is a question for all power to determine.

If major ocean currents ever break down, I believe it's within humanity's available energy budget to restart them.  That sounds like it'd be fun to me, the kind of weather control capability we ought to be building up anyways.

There are senses in which I prefer how I feel while fasting, especially on days 2, 3, and 4.  Day 1 is always the hungriest, while on day 5 I often start to feel unwell.  As I sensitize to this source of variation in the feeling of my body, is there a skill that can develop which extends fasting tolerance?  Does the sensitivity which makes me aware of this variation contribute also my tolerance for it?  I wonder if I will eventually be able to comfortably push back the durations of my fasts.  Will I someday eat only two days per two weeks?
