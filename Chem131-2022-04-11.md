The lab on Friday will be in room 314, not in the lab room.  We do not need goggles this week.  The lab on the 22nd will be in the lab room and will require goggles.

With the structure of HCCH and having a triple bond between the carbons, is the compound ethyne.  Commonly called acetylene, it is used in welding, in which it reacts with oxygen to produce flames with temperatures above 3300 celsius.

Alkenes and alkynes are families of hydrocarbons that contain double and triple bond, respectively.  They are called unsaturated hydrocarbons, because they do not contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms.  They will react with hydrogen gas to increase the number of hydrogen atoms and become alkanes.  Remember, carbon atoms always form four covalent bonds.

Alkenes contain one or more C-C double bonds.  They have bond angles of 120 degrees and a trigonal planar arrangement.

In ethene (C2H4), two carbon atoms are connected by a double bond.  (Commentary:  There is no methene, so ethene is the simplest alkene.)
