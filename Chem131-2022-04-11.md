The lab on Friday will be in room 314, not in the lab room.  We do not need goggles this week.  The lab on the 22nd will be in the lab room and will require goggles.

With the structure of HCCH and having a triple bond between the carbons, is the compound ethyne.  Commonly called acetylene, it is used in welding, in which it reacts with oxygen to produce flames with temperatures above 3300 celsius.

Alkenes and alkynes are families of hydrocarbons that contain double and triple bond, respectively.  They are called unsaturated hydrocarbons, because they do not contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms.  They will react with hydrogen gas to increase the number of hydrogen atoms and become alkanes.  Remember, carbon atoms always form four covalent bonds.

Alkenes contain one or more C-C double bonds.  They have bond angles of 120 degrees and a trigonal planar arrangement.

In ethene (C2H4), two carbon atoms are connected by a double bond.  (Commentary:  There is no methene, so ethene is the simplest alkene.)  Ethene is more commonly known as ethylene.  It's an important plant hormone involved in promoting the ripening of fruits such as bananas.  It accelerates the breakdown of cellulose in plants, which causes flowers to wilt and leaves to fall from trees.  (Commentary:  This application of ethene is straight from the book and not very relevant.)

Alkynes contain one or more C-C triple bonds.  In ethyne (C2H2), commonly called acetylene, two carbon atoms are connected by a triple bond.  Each carbon is also bonded to one hydrogen atom.  Each carbon atom in the triple bond has a linear arrangement with a bond angle of 180 degrees.  (Commentary:  My trig course would call this a *straight angle*.)

Double bonds are indicated on line-angle formulas by a second line alongside one of the lines.  Triple bonds are indicated on such formulas by a second and third line alongside one of the lines.

When naming alkenes and alkynes, name the longest carbon chain that contains the double or triple bond.  Number the carbon chain starting from the end nearer the double or triple bond.  Give the location and name for each substituent in alphabetical order as a prefix to the alkene or alkyne name.
