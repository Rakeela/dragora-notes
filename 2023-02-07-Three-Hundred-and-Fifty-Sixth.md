Morning weigh-in:  250.7 pounds.  I've eaten a bagel with lox that I bought last night.  I'm down in weight vs this time last week.  Maybe eating freely on Saturday isn't a disaster.

I'm so hungry though.  I'm demoralized and wanting nothing more than food.

I decided to violate my diet by eating one of my boston cream handpies.  Each one is individually 410 calories, so one of those by itself is as much as I'm allowed to eat in a day.  I've definitely overeaten today.  Hopefully it'll make me feel more capable of getting through the day.  I kept thinking though, "maybe I should have a rum and coke instead".  A small amount of alcohol should improve weight loss potential.  A boston cream handpie definitely worsens it.  Too late now.  I've already eaten the handpie.

I wonder if that hopeless exhaustion I felt earlier is what it's like to be starving.  My energy levels recovered so well with a bit more food!

68,663 words on the file.  I've trimmed off the Glimmering Jungle parts of Ekis' Travelogue, leaving the editing pass on the second draft complete.  I've completely blown through my 15k reduction estimate by the choice to discard six chapters.  From here, I'll be writing fresh on the second draft.

I managed to resist buying a mallowtop Reese's candy.  It was hard!  I really love them.  They're only available seasonally.  I've already overeaten today.  Maybe I'll buy one tomorrow.
