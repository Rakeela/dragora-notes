10:44.  Oops.  I forgot to record my starting word count before beginning to write today.  Fortunately, I can use yesterday's finishing count.  50,621.

10:45.  Even though my writing quota is set much lower than my usual daily output, it does still promote daily writing.

13:01.  51,415.  1,934 words on the chapter.  794 words of progress.

14:50.  52,927.  3,456 words on the chapter.  Crud.  I really don't want to cut this back.  I'm not done writing Kaaaaire.

15:19.  53,354.  3,883 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.  Argh.  I don't know how to cut 883 words from this chapter.  That's a scene!

15:43.  53,268.  3,797 words on the chapter.  Argh!  I don't know what to trim.

16:00.  53,080.  3,609 words on the chapter.  I can't help but keep trimming, but I don't know how to cut 609 words from the chapter.

16:09.  53,049.  3,578 words on the chapter.  I don't know how to eliminate 578 words from this chapter!  I have to cut a scene somewhere!

16:10.  Hm.  I thought of something theoretically cuttable, but I don't want to do it.  It's 262 words.

16:13.  Yeah, I'm not doing it.  I'm just going to bust my target once.  This is what I get for writing without regularly checking my length.

16:14.  53,051 words.  1,634 words of progress.  New chapter.

18:04.  53,932.  853 words on the chapter.  3,311 words of progress.  I'm struggling with this chapter.  I mean, I struggle in one sense or another every time, and this one isn't exceptionally hard, it's just...  It's disappointing me.  I have a great, high-kinetic idea that I want to surge forward and implement, but I'm getting caught in stuff that's kinda boring.  I don't know how to write this bit snappy-fast and get to the part I'm excited about.  Writing it the way I'm writing it establishes bits of world detail.  Would it be better if I wrote it faster and got to the point instead of talking about world bits that I think are cool?

20:01.  54,062.  983 words on the chapter.

20:37.  54,432.  1,355 words on the chapter.  Pushing forward.  I've advanced the story a little bit.  Refocusing regularly by updating my wordcount seems to help me.

20:58.  54,582.  1,505 words on the chapter.  3,961 words of progress.  Coming up on something horrific, but I'm not writing it right now, and maybe not tonight.  I'm taking a break and possibly stopping for the night.

21:11.  I didn't work ten hours straight today.  I also took an hour off around the 18:04 checkpoint.  Can't remember if it was an hour off before or an hour off after, but it was around then.
