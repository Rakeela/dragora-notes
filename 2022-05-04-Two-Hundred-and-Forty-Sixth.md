I'm reading about the basics of chemistry, and I found myself wondering if there might be additional islands of stability among isotopes.  Could the geometry of the strong nuclear force be manipulated to create atoms that wouldn't form naturally?

It seems strange to me that isotopes are measured solely by proton and neutron count.  These are literally extant objects exerting literal forces on each other.  Must they always glob randomly onto each other?  What if a super-light stable element could be created by manipulating the structure of the atomic nucleus so that exactly positioned neutrons hold onto more protons than they would otherwise hold?  Equally though perhaps less usefully, what if a super-heavy stable element could be created?

Even if scientists have no idea how to create such objects, could their structure be simulated in computers?
