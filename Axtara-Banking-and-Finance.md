#Axtara-Banking-and-Finance

Dragon slice of life.  A dragon goes to a kingdom on the edge of civilization to set up a bank, and discovers interesting things therein.  VERY positive energy.  I found this book so cheerful that it was hard for my depressive mind to work through.

The period of dragon-human conflict in this setting is euphemistically referred to as "the Bad Days".
