#Alien-1979

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

If this isn't the best in the series, I'm never gonna find out.  Something about this series had a mega-anti-vibe to me.  I don't like the setting and I don't like the monster.  I've seen part of another movie in the series and I didn't like it.  The first movie was okay, though.  I liked it.
