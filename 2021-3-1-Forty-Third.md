Drafting stories involves a lot of change from the original material, doesn't it?

I wonder if I've struggled with redrafting, as I've struggled to discern enough of a "necessary structure" for the stories that I've written.  I've struggled to set the benchmarks.

The impact of the novel on the mind is necessarily an information structure.  The progress of the novel is a progressive addition to that information structure.  The total information structure of the novel is not perceived in any particular mind.

The threads of the novel are the things that people are trying to achieve, or that may happen as side effects of what they are trying to achieve; these threads thus are the result of pressures applied by the narratives of each character in the novel at each point.  Each narrative/character pairing is an accumulating information state as well.  The reader to achieve a reasonable comprehension does not need to understand every sub-structure in this, but the author does.  It's quite daunting.

Yet a draft can proceed 'illogically', processing over great spans of this complexity, and accreting errors as it goes.  Redrafting fixes this and makes the material nearer to its intended ideal, yet even so no author writes without error.  Whence comes the draft, when it steps beyond the rectified structure?

More pragmatically, I'm considering attempting to upload a world-building archive, either here in this jumble of files, or else in a separate simultaneous archive project.  I expect it will be more charismatic if I produce it as its own structure, but it will be easier to produce such structures at all if I work on them *here*.

Reading about Thymic Involution, apparently the thymus becomes something of a crippled fatty organ.  If the hindrance of its function were literally caused by the intrusion of adipocytes (mechanical disruption), is there anything that could be done to improve the boundaries of the thymus?

Trying to look up chemical treatments for steatosis is getting bogged down in how all diseases of the *liver* are lifestyle issues, from drinking to sedentarism.  That's great, but a chemical treatment for steatosis of the organs might also have applicability worth investigating to the thymus, whose universal steatosis is one of the factors which inflicts aging on people.
