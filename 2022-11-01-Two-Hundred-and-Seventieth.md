I'm officially beginning Nanowrimo work!  The draft I'm working on currently contains 4,589 words.  I'll have to deduct that from my goal, so I'll be successful with Nanowrimo if I bring the draft up to 54,589 words rather than 50,000.  Watch me mess it up one of these days and update with the wrong total.

The scene I'm starting on is 448 words.  I have to record that as well in order to get an accurate tally before the day is done.  The software I'm using to write in only offers me an updated wordcount once per day.  That's a bit inadequate for Nanowrimo.

In hindsight, maybe I was doomed to be a vegetarian.  My dad cooked steaks on the regular.  That should've been a fine thing, right?  The problem is that I didn't like steak.  I've never understood the appeal of meat-slab.

Finishing my first writing session for Nanowrimo, the scene I was working on now stands at 2,405 words.  1,957 words is the length of my first session of Nanowrimo writing.  I may or may not come back to the story today.  More is better...
