12:03.  1,202 words on the file.

12:23.  One hour on the treadmill.  1.1 miles.  I turned it off inappropriately again.

14:39.  I cut off the treadmill again.  No idea how long it was running.  I keep getting distracted by something on the treadmill.  There are air bubbles trapped under the plastic over the pause button on it.  I keep being drawn to fidget with them.  To try to tamp them down.  They seem to be multiplying as I mess with it.  I think I'm accidentally pressing air under it.  I think there's a hole in the plastic right there.

14:45.  Everything I eat leaves me desperate to devour more, until I'm sick from overeating!  If I do not eat, I am hungry!  If I do eat, I have a desperate desire for food!  It is not even proper hunger.  There is a difference.  One of them feels like a need.  The other feels like being *utterly distracted*.

14:46.  Technically, both feelings are distracting, but the one I experience while well-fed is frustrating because it does not respond to normal signals of fullness.  It recedes only if I'm considerably oversatiated.

14:47.  I guess what I'm saying is that there is a "hungry" that goes away if I eat small amounts of food, and a "drive to overeat" that goes away if I eat myself sick.  "Hungry" is intensely distracting when I fast, but "drive to overeat" is what makes me gain weight.

15:10.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.

15:45.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  But I haven't eaten anything since I posted that last time, so hey.  I'm trying to complain rather than eat.

17:22.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  I don't need food!  I've eaten enough today!  I've skipped enough meals in my lifetime to know that I don't need any more food at all today!

17:38.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  Driving me spare here.  Also, has it really been 16 minutes?  I am completely stuck in something that I'm writing.

21:39.  4,030 words on the file.  2,828 words of progress.  Yay, I was writing again today!

21:41.  4,036.  2,834 words of progress.  I'm going to go to the store and buy food I don't need, but not sweets.  No leftover Halloween candy for me this time.

22:31.  I ate sushi.

22:35.  4,043 words on the file.  2,841 words of progress.  I was going to stop for the night, but then I saw something I wanted to change.

22:37.  Current plan:  Make a bunch of posts tomorrow that start with "DRIVE.  TO.  EAT."  Because really, it's annoying.  Hunger takes a long time to set in.  The drive to eat is quick and neurotic.  Like, compulsive.  Can eating be a compulsive behavior?
