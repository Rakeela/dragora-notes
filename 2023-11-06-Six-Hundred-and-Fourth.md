9:53.  There's still something fishy about hearing a honk just as I'm laying back down to sleep in the morning.

11:36.  18,658.  18,730.  I didn't record exactly when I started work, but my first work-related action was from 10:02.

14:03.  19,722.  1,064 words of progress.  Hit the next stall-point.

14:49.  19,722.  I stopped for a while.  I took a break.  I didn't think about the story.  Nothing got done.  I don't feel like the break helped me advance past the stall point.

15:48.  20,108.  I feel sick, and that's challenging my abstinence from sweets.

17:11.  20,845.  2,187 words of progress.

17:13.  I'm reporting what I've got to the Nanowrimo website.  I'm not necessarily done yet, but I'm pretty stuck.
