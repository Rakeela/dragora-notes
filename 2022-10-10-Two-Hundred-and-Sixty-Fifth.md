I feel like going to college messed up my research skills.  I'm not exercising my research skills much in my current classes and they atrophied...  I need more classes that encourage writing essays with citations.  I feel like I need that more than I need calculus.  But I have more calculus requirements to deal with than I have essay-writing requirements to deal with.
