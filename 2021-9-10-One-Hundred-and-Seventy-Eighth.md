I don't really respect people who make decisions in secret, nor who overreact to inputs, creating embarrassments that they must later conceal in secret.

I once feared that I'd learned of the death of someone I knew, and when I spoke to them they proceeded to *magnanimously* inform an entire community of concerns that I'd intended for them alone.  This was of course dreary as they were therefore informing the community of an unknown death.  There was no cause to do that.  They later removed me from that community without speaking to me, an obvious consequence of the basic embarrassment that they inflicted on themselves and blamed me for.

They were retaliating against me as though my personal concern were an infiltration attempt against the entire community... when it's like... dude, I never cared for anyone else in that community, just you, the one guy I'd actually spoken to.  It was your own demoralization action against the community that you treated me as having originated.  God, congrats on protecting your position.

That watcher-of-loyalties act is an example of why loyalist gatekeepers are symptomatic of corruption.  The guy made people unhappy as 'my fault' and later removed me from that environment in a specifically dishonest way, without ever approaching me with any concerns, because he had doubts about my loyalty due to an *embarrassment that he inflicted on me without cause*.  His decision was treated as my decision.

I have a sworn oath against loyalty, as I believe that loyalty *is* corruption.  People aren't *loyal* to their friends.  They're kind and honest to them, which makes people want to stick together when they find it.  Loyalty is a subpar replacement for honesty for people who can't find honesty.  It's most valued among criminals, as they need to know who will degrade themselves violating others.  Corrupt people who betray corruption are totally useless.
