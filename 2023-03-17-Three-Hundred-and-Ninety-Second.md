Morning weigh-in:  241.5 pounds

I ate a chocolate bar and a cadbury creme egg.  Stopping eating is harder than starting to eat.  I mean...  Bugger it, I'm eating another chocolate bar.  I found a kind of chocolate bar that is totally irresistable.  Seattle Chocolate Carrot Cake bars.  They're "chocolate truffle bars with walnuts and spices" according to the front.  So I'm eating a large, sweet breakfast this morning.

Hunger is so frequent.  If I eat whenever I am hungry, my insulin levels remain elevated all day long, and my body never taps stored energy.

401 words on the file.  937 words on the file.  This is going better than it has recently, relatively speaking.  It's so hard to focus on writing lately.

It's so hard to complete my exercise today, too.  I'm four hours and twenty one minutes in and it's kicking my tail.  Kistaro looked at me and said I look tired today.  Apparently I have dark circles under my eyes.  I can really feel the fatigue today.

I'm sort of hungry/not-hungry.  I don't feel like I need more food, but I'm so tired.  I want to eat for energy.  Except I know that it wouldn't work.

Oops.  I accidentally double-tapped on the pause button of the treadmill controls.  So I'll record my first session here:  I walked 35,875 steps, burning an estimated 1,822 kcal, covering 13.0 miles, at an average speed of 2.1 mph.  I walked for 6 hours, 6 minutes, and 59 seconds.  I'll resume after a bio break.

I wish I were a robot.  I feel like I eat $20 a day or more, and I self-conscious about that.  If I could get by eating cheap soups, I could surely eat at a quarter of the price.  I can't do it.  I need chocolate for my emotional health and cheese for my physical health.  If I were a robot, I wouldn't need cheese at all, and I could just simulate the experience of chocolate.

Second treadmill session:  4,427 steps, 224 kcal, 1.6 miles, average speed 2.2 mph.  43 minutes, 24 seconds.
