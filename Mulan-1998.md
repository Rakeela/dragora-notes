#Mulan-1998

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Forgotten

This movie is one of the more recent thing I've forgotten.  I watched it when it was newish, and I've watched it every few years since.  I think I've watched it four times in all.  I bet I'd ace a multiple choice test based on it, but right now an essay question would be an awful thing to attempt.
