# Necessary Experimental Tools

In order to pursue my [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]], I'll need tools to manipulate mitochondria.  Currently, I don't know the full extent of necessary tools.  This node will accumulate information on that subject as I discover it.

Current known requirements:
200x inverted microscope
Movement-reducing pulsed flow microinjector
Medical centrifuge
Bioreactor
