# Necessary Experimental Tools

In order to pursue my [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]], I'll need tools to manipulate mitochondria.  Currently, I don't know the full extent of necessary tools.  This node will accumulate information on that subject as I discover it.  Related to this node, I will also need to construct an [[mitochondria-experimental-protocols]] node.

Current known requirements:
200x inverted microscope
Movement-reducing pulsed flow microinjector
Medical centrifuge
Bioreactor (Note, may be possible to pursue individual experiments with petri dishes, but bioreactor will be needed eventually for scaling)
Mitochondria dyes (2x minimum)
Safe eukaryotic bacteria (yeast?)
Tissue dissociator (do I need this for working with yeast?)
