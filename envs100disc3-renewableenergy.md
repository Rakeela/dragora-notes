# Envs100disc3 RenewableEnergy

   - Topic: Renewable Energy
   - Instructions specify picking three sources of renewable energy and a country, then writing up (in three paragraphs) a plan to transition to those sources.
   - 1st paragraph: Name the country, name the three sources, and justify them.
   - 2nd paragraph: Further justification of the three chosen sources.
   - 3rd paragraph: How do you convince the public that these are the right three sources?
   - The per-paragraph specification on this essay makes it a little less fun and may increase the challenge.
