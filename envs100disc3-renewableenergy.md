# Envs100disc3 RenewableEnergy

   - Topic: Renewable Energy
   - Instructions specify picking three sources of renewable energy and a country, then writing up (in three paragraphs) a plan to transition to those sources.
   - 1st paragraph: Name the country, name the three sources, and justify them.
   - 2nd paragraph: Further justification of the three chosen sources.
   - 3rd paragraph: How do you convince the public that these are the right three sources?
   - The per-paragraph specification on this essay makes it a little less fun and may increase the challenge.

I think I should write favoring hydrogen power storage.  I suspect that hydrogen fuel as a store of power for intermittent power systems is one of the most underutilized potentials on Earth.  I'm comfortable slotting that in as though it were one of the three sources that the essay is focusing on.
Intuitively therefore, the other two sources would be 'wind' and 'solar', the highly intermittent options.  I should spare a moment to look up renewables to make sure that's optimal.

Towards the target of focusing on new potentials...  Ooh.  Tidal, solar, and hydrogen would be a wonderful energy structure for a 'seastead' colony.  Starting out by building a reactor complex at sea that initially exports power (in the form of hydrogen fuel) would provide a rational/economical nucleation point for the seastead community to accrete around.  This could expand humanity's interception of solar energy across wholly new territories without displacing any current land use patterns.  The new green sea market actor would surely help create pressure towards updating international shipping for eco-friendly methods (international shipping is SO BAD for the environment today, old smoggy fuel-suckers predominate).
It's a little too ambitious for this.  I don't even know how to begin for planning the economics of it.  I'll do it anyways; it makes the essay fun, and I don't think the teacher will mark me down for overstepping.
Which country should I start in?  It has to be a wealthy country with coastline access.  I don't know if there's further specifications than that.  Maybe somewhere in the mediterranean so that the first offshore reactor complex doesn't have to face hurricane risks?  Greece might be appropriate.  There's no way the Grecian government can afford a project like this, but 1) their government is corrupt, and so might make the attempt anyways, and 2) if constructed as an international project it could be an opportunity to bring in international help.  The same considerations apply to Italy, which is a little less corrupt and a little less incapable of affording it, and actually has a better economic case for this; it could bring some vital new economic functioning to stagnating southern Italian cities which are presently hurting the nation's prestige and budget.  So...  Italy.  Although I think France has the best shot on Earth at being capable of building and operating such a system... so, France?  Except I think Italy would gain much more from the off-shore reactor complex.  Hm.  Do I go with the nation most likely to be capable of the project, or the nation with the most to gain should the project succeed?  It's a fair venture for an international project, and yet even as an international project, Italy gains most if it can get in first, and gains more than most applicable countries at that.  Europe is generally a stable place, though not without room for improvement; improving south Italian vitality would amend one of its potential instability factors.
I think Italy is the best choice of nation for this.  Although France has more of the necessary technical competency for the project, I get the impression that France is delicately positioned recently, and can't afford such an expensive project.  Italy also arguably can't afford expensive projects, but this project wouldn't actually help a delicately positioned France, whereas it could help a delicately positioned Italy.  If building an offshore reactor complex stresses the resources of France, that will be bad for France; if building an offshore reactor complex stresses the resources of Italy, that will be good for Italy.
Quick lookup on Italy's energy mixture... good grief, 9% biomass?  Nothing says 'we could do better' quite like the inclusion of a substantial fraction of biomass power in a nation's energy mixture.  Don't get me wrong, biomass power is even properly renewable... it's just not an impressive source.

First draft:
I think one of the most excitingly unnoticed potentials on Earth is that humanity could build offshore reactor complexes to harness solar and tidal[] energy to produce hydrogen fuel[] for export worldwide.  We could benefit from a lot of these, as they would increase our available clean energy budget globally no matter where they were built.  Yet of all the nations of Earth, I think that Italy would have the most to gain from producing such a complex.  Building offshore from the infamously stagnant and expensive communities of southern Italy[], offshore reactor complexes could provide vital prosperity to communities which have struggled to integrate with the fast-paced global economy.
These offshore solar/tidal hydrogen plants could serve a similar fuel-provision purpose to today's oil rigs, with similar capital structures and much better ecological implications.  Furthermore, by building them offshore, we could expand our access to the energy budget provided to us by the moon and sun without disrupting any existing land usage pattern.  The in situ hydrogen production eliminates the inherent intermittency of the facility's power sources without even the need of oceanic power cables.  The production of hydrogen can be the whole (initial) purpose of these reactor complexes, and they would help bootstrap Earth's establishment of a hydrogen-based economy[] thereby.  With ongoing supplies of hydrogen fuel from specialized facilities, urban communities could start building hydrogen power plants[] and encouraging the deployment of hydrogen fuel cells in transport[].
Targeting the south Italian coastline for the first construction of a solar/tidal offshore reactor would be excellent for PR reasons.  It would provide new resources and a productive source of employment to communities that need them while appealing to (instead of offending) the industrial/commercial sentiments of northern Italian communities that feel southern Italy is already over-subsidized[].  The facilities would be a global novelty and a way to contribute to the prosperity of the whole Earth, therefore also appealing to nationalistic strains of Italian politics[] by improving the nation's prestige without a concomitant risk of encouraging international strife.  Advocacy for the project could also point out that it would provide an answer to, "What do we do with the oil derricks and oil workers as we move away from oil?", since the offshore reactors would provide employment of a similar kind.  This could be sold as a way to soothe transition stresses[] while moving away from fossil fuels.  Finally, I think I would be remiss not to mention that among the public relations benefits of this plan is the fact that clean central reactor complexes would be excellent nucleation points for seasteading communities[], encouraging novel eco-friendly urbanization in a way that dirty oil derricks never could.

As with other discussion posts this semester, this will need at least two citations.  I think I can do better than that... though I don't think I can do as well as the concept deserves, given that providing a full cost accounting and reassurance of a profitable outcome is beyond my skills.  As before, I'm modifying the above draft with [] wherever I think I can cite something.
I'm really very satisfied with the verbiage above.  I've modified it slightly in place, but I don't foresee a need for a complete second draft to change the writing unless the citations I dig up conflict with the basic thrust of the essay.

Minor note: I wish I could give this project to central America, instead.  It could help develop them by providing energy resources and prosperous jobs to impoverished communities, which in turn would reduce one of the more unpleasant social pressures on American policy as well as a contagion risk.  (Illegal immigration is considerably less hygienic than legal immigration!)  Yet those regions are so violent that the very problems which make them sympathetic also make solving their issues harder.  I suspect the project would have to pay off a crime lord to complete.  Since they would have to hide that payoff, the costs would be inflated, and the project would look globally uneconomical.  The economic costs of crime get concealed.  Organized crime exists in Italy as well, but the Italian government is more competent to resist it, especially on a project of international prestige.  Not even in perennially unstable African nations is organized crime as extreme as it is in South and Central America.

Can tidal power operate in the vicinity of Italy?  Does the Mediterranean have a sufficient tidal range?  If so, should I add a mention to the essay about the concurrent value of a sufficient tidal range in the sheltered Mediterranean?  This may justify a redraft.

A related note for my own files: could spiky sound baffles installed underwater be used to break up unwanted marine vibrations?  I've no interest in inflicting incidental suffering on marine life.  Marine ecologies are sparse enough as it is given the energy and oxygen shortages of marine environments.  The baffles would probably be colonized by reef-organisms, but that may not impair their intended functioning; if they still work as sound baffles, increasing the local marine ecology's surface area can be classified as a benefit.

Is marine wind more advantageous than marine solar?  I like using solar for this, because I suspect that marine solar will interfere less with my quixotic idea of nucleating seasteading communities off of this...  Hm, I just talked myself into keeping it at solar, though off-shore wind-farming is definitely a thing.

If corrosion is an issue in producing tidal wave generators, why don't engineers use ceramic components?  I didn't have to search hard to find a marine ceramics supplier marketing its ceramic components for saltwater-exposed environments.  Sometimes humanity uses metal when it should be using metal-doped clay.

I've dug up some wave energy maps for the Italian coastline.  Italy isn't ideal for wave power, because the wave energy is marginal unless building off of the coast of Sardinia to attain 9 kW/m, a level conventionally considered suitable for wave power.  The second-best location is however more politically advantageous, which would be to build instead off the coast of Cosenza.  The wave energy level there is 4 kW/m, which is below the 5 kW/m threshold generally considered for wave energy.  If 4 kW/m wave energies were considered suitable for wave energy power plants, the amount of viable coastline globally goes up sharply.

This is just wool-gathering rather than something I would reference in the essay here, but I wonder why electromagnetic linkages aren't used to achieve frictionless energy transfers between kinetic harvesting equipments and the turbines that those equipments are powering.  But then, field effect technologies are one of my old fantasies.  Reducing energy loss to friction is one way to expand the range of economical power extraction sites, and an electromagnetic linkage has the advantage that it can affix the buoy without directly exposing conductive (and corrodable) components to seawater.  Of course, a design like that would have the downside of intensifying humanity's draw on limited rare earth metals, and it would STILL be most valuable in sites of high wave potential.  The device would also be expending power maintaining the linkage, since electromagnetism isn't free; that means it would have passive power use, increasing the on-site battery storage requirements and eroding the gain from reduced friction.

It might still be advantageous overall in energy efficiency; if not, it might still be worth it for the ability to have a device with no surfaces susceptible to saltwater corrosion.  Barring a storm strong enough to break the entire generator, I don't know what would stop a ceramic wave power station from operating indefinitely... though it might need barnacles scraped off it periodically.  The buoys would lose efficiency from sea growth if it could adhere to them, and the whole mechanism could freeze up from a barnacle attached in the wrong location.

I wonder if an electromagnetic linkage would have any advantage in capturing the chaotic all-angles energy inputs from wave energy, but that's the wooliest thing in this file.  I've no idea.  I'm imagining this as a ceramic buoy with a partial ceramic sheath, with the two connecting via electromagnets inside behind electroceramic disks.  The whole buoy doesn't need to be made of electroceramics if doing so is not economical.  Extracting energy from the primary up-and-down motion of the buoy should be straightforward, but the buoy would also have side-to-side and forward-and-back motions.  Is there any way to also extract the energy that pushes against the sheath?  ...and now I'm imagining some delicate clockwork insulated inside the equipment that gives the linkage just a little more freedom of movement which it uses to power ratchets.  Hah, is that how these things work?

If only I could tow a rare earth asteroid to Earth, hah.  People talk about how the value of particular metals would crash if asteroids rich in those metals were towed into Earth orbit, but as a fan of long-term economic growth, my answer to that is, "Bring it on!"  Fundamental cost reductions in raw material inputs spur wonderful advances in economic growth.
