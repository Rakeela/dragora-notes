# Envs100disc3 RenewableEnergy

   - Topic: Renewable Energy
   - Instructions specify picking three sources of renewable energy and a country, then writing up (in three paragraphs) a plan to transition to those sources.
   - 1st paragraph: Name the country, name the three sources, and justify them.
   - 2nd paragraph: Further justification of the three chosen sources.
   - 3rd paragraph: How do you convince the public that these are the right three sources?
   - The per-paragraph specification on this essay makes it a little less fun and may increase the challenge.

I think I should write favoring hydrogen power storage.  I suspect that hydrogen fuel as a store of power for intermittent power systems is one of the most underutilized potentials on Earth.  I'm comfortable slotting that in as though it were one of the three sources that the essay is focusing on.
Intuitively therefore, the other two sources would be 'wind' and 'solar', the highly intermittent options.  I should spare a moment to look up renewables to make sure that's optimal.

Towards the target of focusing on new potentials...  Ooh.  Tidal, solar, and hydrogen would be a wonderful energy structure for a 'seastead' colony.  Starting out by building a reactor complex at sea that initially exports power (in the form of hydrogen fuel) would provide a rational/economical nucleation point for the seastead community to accrete around.  This could expand humanity's interception of solar energy across wholly new territories without displacing any current land use patterns.  The new green sea market actor would surely help create pressure towards updating international shipping for eco-friendly methods (international shipping is SO BAD for the environment today, old smoggy fuel-suckers predominate).
It's a little too ambitious for this.  I don't even know how to begin for planning the economics of it.  I'll do it anyways; it makes the essay fun, and I don't think the teacher will mark me down for overstepping.
