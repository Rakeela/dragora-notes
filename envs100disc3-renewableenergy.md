# Envs100disc3 RenewableEnergy

   - Topic: Renewable Energy
   - Instructions specify picking three sources of renewable energy and a country, then writing up (in three paragraphs) a plan to transition to those sources.
   - 1st paragraph: Name the country, name the three sources, and justify them.
   - 2nd paragraph: Further justification of the three chosen sources.
   - 3rd paragraph: How do you convince the public that these are the right three sources?
   - The per-paragraph specification on this essay makes it a little less fun and may increase the challenge.

I think I should write favoring hydrogen power storage.  I suspect that hydrogen fuel as a store of power for intermittent power systems is one of the most underutilized potentials on Earth.  I'm comfortable slotting that in as though it were one of the three sources that the essay is focusing on.
Intuitively therefore, the other two sources would be 'wind' and 'solar', the highly intermittent options.  I should spare a moment to look up renewables to make sure that's optimal.

Towards the target of focusing on new potentials...  Ooh.  Tidal, solar, and hydrogen would be a wonderful energy structure for a 'seastead' colony.  Starting out by building a reactor complex at sea that initially exports power (in the form of hydrogen fuel) would provide a rational/economical nucleation point for the seastead community to accrete around.  This could expand humanity's interception of solar energy across wholly new territories without displacing any current land use patterns.  The new green sea market actor would surely help create pressure towards updating international shipping for eco-friendly methods (international shipping is SO BAD for the environment today, old smoggy fuel-suckers predominate).
It's a little too ambitious for this.  I don't even know how to begin for planning the economics of it.  I'll do it anyways; it makes the essay fun, and I don't think the teacher will mark me down for overstepping.
Which country should I start in?  It has to be a wealthy country with coastline access.  I don't know if there's further specifications than that.  Maybe somewhere in the mediterranean so that the first offshore reactor complex doesn't have to face hurricane risks?  Greece might be appropriate.  There's no way the Grecian government can afford a project like this, but 1) their government is corrupt, and so might make the attempt anyways, and 2) if constructed as an international project it could be an opportunity to bring in international help.  The same considerations apply to Italy, which is a little less corrupt and a little less incapable of affording it, and actually has a better economic case for this; it could bring some vital new economic functioning to stagnating southern Italian cities which are presently hurting the nation's prestige and budget.  So...  Italy.  Although I think France has the best shot on Earth at being capable of building and operating such a system... so, France?  Except I think Italy would gain much more from the off-shore reactor complex.  Hm.  Do I go with the nation most likely to be capable of the project, or the nation with the most to gain should the project succeed?  It's a fair venture for an international project, and yet even as an international project, Italy gains most if it can get in first, and gains more than most applicable countries at that.  Europe is generally a stable place, though not without room for improvement; improving south Italian vitality would amend one of its potential instability factors.
I think Italy is the best choice of nation for this.  Although France has more of the necessary technical competency for the project, I get the impression that France is delicately positioned recently, and can't afford such an expensive project.  Italy also arguably can't afford expensive projects, but this project wouldn't actually help a delicately positioned France, whereas it could help a delicately positioned Italy.  If building an offshore reactor complex stresses the resources of France, that will be bad for France; if building an offshore reactor complex stresses the resources of Italy, that will be good for Italy.
Quick lookup on Italy's energy mixture... good grief, 9% biomass?  Nothing says 'we could do better' quite like the inclusion of a substantial fraction of biomass power in a nation's energy mixture.  Don't get me wrong, biomass power is even properly renewable... it's just not an impressive source.

First draft:
I think one of the most excitingly unnoticed potentials on Earth is that humanity could build offshore reactor complexes to harness solar and tidal[] energy to produce hydrogen fuel[] for export worldwide.  We could benefit from a lot of these, as they would increase our available clean energy budget globally no matter where they were built.  Yet of all the nations of Earth, I think that Italy would have the most to gain from producing such a complex.  Building offshore from the infamously stagnant and expensive communities of southern Italy[], offshore reactor complexes could provide vital prosperity to communities which have struggled to integrate with the fast-paced global economy.
These offshore solar/tidal hydrogen plants could serve a similar fuel-provision purpose to today's oil rigs, with similar capital structures and much better ecological implications.  Furthermore, by building them offshore, we could expand our access to the energy budget provided to us by the moon and sun without disrupting any existing land usage pattern.  The in situ hydrogen production eliminates the inherent intermittency of the facility's power sources without even the need of oceanic power cables.  The production of hydrogen can be the whole (initial) purpose of these reactor complexes, and they would help bootstrap Earth's establishment of a hydrogen-based economy[] thereby.  With ongoing supplies of hydrogen fuel from specialized facilities, urban communities could start building hydrogen power plants[] and encouraging the deployment of hydrogen fuel cells in transport[].
Targeting the south Italian coastline for the first construction of a solar/tidal offshore reactor would be excellent for PR reasons.  It would provide new resources and a productive source of employment to communities that need them while appealing to (instead of offending) the industrial/commercial sentiments of northern Italian communities that feel southern Italy is already over-subsidized[].  The facilities would be a global novelty and a way to contribute to the prosperity of the whole Earth, therefore also appealing to nationalistic strains of Italian politics[] by improving the nation's prestige without a concomitant risk of encouraging international strife.  Advocacy for the project could also point out that it would provide an answer to, "What do we do with the oil derricks and oil workers as we move away from oil?", since the offshore reactors would provide employment of a similar kind.  This could be sold as a way to soothe transition stresses[] while moving away from fossil fuels.  Finally, I think I would be remiss not to mention that among the public relations benefits of this plan is the fact that clean central reactor complexes would be excellent nucleation points for seasteading communities[], encouraging novel eco-friendly urbanization in a way that dirty oil derricks never could.

As with other discussion posts this semester, this will need at least two citations.  I think I can do better than that... though I don't think I can do as well as the concept deserves, given that providing a full cost accounting and reassurance of a profitable outcome is beyond my skills.  As before, I'm modifying the above draft with [] wherever I think I can cite something.
I'm really very satisfied with the verbiage above.  I've modified it slightly in place, but I don't foresee a need for a complete second draft to change the writing unless the citations I dig up conflict with the basic thrust of the essay.

Minor note: I wish I could give this project to central America, instead.  It could help develop them by providing energy resources and prosperous jobs to impoverished communities, which in turn would reduce one of the more unpleasant social pressures on American policy as well as a contagion risk.  (Illegal immigration is considerably less hygienic than legal immigration!)  Yet those regions are so violent that the very problems which make them sympathetic also make solving their issues harder.  I suspect the project would have to pay off a crime lord to complete.  Since they would have to hide that payoff, the costs would be inflated, and the project would look globally uneconomical.  The economic costs of crime get concealed.  Organized crime exists in Italy as well, but the Italian government is more competent to resist it, especially on a project of international prestige.  Not even in perennially unstable African nations is organized crime as extreme as it is in South and Central America.

Can tidal power operate in the vicinity of Italy?  Does the Mediterranean have a sufficient tidal range?  If so, should I add a mention to the essay about the concurrent value of a sufficient tidal range in the sheltered Mediterranean?  This may justify a redraft.

A note for my own files: could spiky sound baffles installed underwater be used to break up unwanted marine vibrations?  I've no interest in inflicting incidental suffering on marine life.  Marine ecologies are sparse enough as it is given the energy and oxygen shortages of marine environments.  The baffles would probably be colonized by reef-organisms, but that may not impair their intended functioning; if they still work as sound baffles, increasing the local marine ecology's surface area and bringing it a little nearer the energy-rich surface waters can be classified as a benefit.

---
Is marine wind more advantageous than marine solar?  I like using solar for this, because I suspect that marine solar will interfere less with my quixotic idea of nucleating seasteading communities off of this...  Hm, I just talked myself into keeping it at solar, though off-shore wind-farming is definitely a thing.  Off-shore wind-farming is a thing because people don't want to live near it, so it's bad for a reactor complex with long-term staff.

If corrosion is an issue in producing tidal wave generators, why don't engineers use ceramic components?  I didn't have to search hard to find a marine ceramics supplier marketing its ceramic components for saltwater-exposed environments.  Sometimes humanity uses metal when it should be using metal-doped clay.

I've dug up some wave energy maps for the Italian coastline.  Italy isn't ideal for wave power, because the wave energy is marginal unless building off of the coast of Sardinia to attain 9 kW/m, a level conventionally considered suitable for wave power.  The second-best location is however more politically advantageous, which would be to build instead off the coast of Cosenza.  The wave energy level there is 4 kW/m, which is below the 5 kW/m threshold generally considered for wave energy.  If 4 kW/m wave energies were considered suitable for wave energy power plants, the amount of viable coastline globally goes up sharply.

This is just wool-gathering rather than something I would reference in the essay here, but I wonder why electromagnetic linkages aren't used to achieve frictionless energy transfers between kinetic harvesting equipments and the turbines that those equipments are powering.  But then, field effect technologies are one of my old fantasies.  Reducing energy loss to friction is one way to expand the range of economical power extraction sites, and an electromagnetic linkage has the advantage that it can affix the buoy without directly exposing conductive (and corrodable) components to seawater.  Of course, a design like that would have the downside of intensifying humanity's draw on limited rare earth metals, and it would STILL be most valuable in sites of high wave potential.  The device would also be expending power maintaining the linkage, since electromagnetism isn't free; that means it would have passive power use, increasing the on-site battery storage requirements and eroding the gain from reduced friction.

It might still be advantageous overall in energy efficiency; if not, it might still be worth it for the ability to have a device with no surfaces susceptible to saltwater corrosion.  Barring a storm strong enough to break the entire generator, I don't know what would stop a ceramic wave power station from operating indefinitely... though it might need barnacles scraped off it periodically.  The buoys would lose efficiency from sea growth if it could adhere to them, and the whole mechanism could freeze up from a barnacle attached in the wrong location.

I wonder if an electromagnetic linkage would have any advantage in capturing the chaotic all-angles energy inputs from wave energy, but that's the wooliest thing in this file.  I've no idea.  I'm imagining this as a ceramic buoy with a partial ceramic sheath, with the two connecting via electromagnets inside behind electroceramic disks.  The whole buoy doesn't need to be made of electroceramics if doing so is not economical.  Extracting energy from the primary up-and-down motion of the buoy should be straightforward, but the buoy would also have side-to-side and forward-and-back motions.  Is there any way to also extract the energy that pushes against the sheath?  ...and now I'm imagining some delicate clockwork insulated inside the equipment that gives the linkage just a little more freedom of movement which it uses to power ratchets.  Hah, is that how these things work?

If only I could tow a rare earth asteroid to Earth, hah.  People talk about how the value of particular metals would crash if asteroids rich in those metals were towed into Earth orbit, but as a fan of long-term economic growth, my answer to that is, "Bring it on!"  Fundamental cost reductions in raw material inputs spur wonderful advances in economic growth.

---
I wonder if I could argue that low-power wave extraction makes sense to reduce mechanical stresses on the unproven wave generator technologies.  Putting these things we don't know how to make very well only into the most turbulent waters sounds like ideal energy extraction policy, but I wonder if that practice is impairing our ability to learn how to make them!

I can't use it in this essay, but I found a link on sciencedirect.com arguing that Saudi Arabia should build wave-powered desalination systems.  Maybe the Saudis should build an offshore reactor complex such as I propose for the purpose of creating potable water instead of hydrogen fuel!

Finally!  I found something I can use.  This is a link which talks about energy calculations about Sibolga-Tapanuli Tengah (a location in Indonesia with more conventionally favorable wave power potential): https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8226713

I was looking for this, because it exposes numbers that I can use to calculate wave power potentials at a location with a lower potential.  I've written elsewhere in my notes that the fundamental popularity of environmentalism is due to its roots in causality.  Just so, I think the most stoutly persuasive arguments are based on numerical literacy.

This talks about three different systems for wave power extraction: tapered channels, power buoys, and oscillating water colum (sic).  It names tapered channel systems as having the strongest energy output.  Tapered channel systems work by narrowing, causing waves to increase in height and fill an elevated basin.  Water flowing back to the ocean by gravity then powers a standard hydroelectric turbine.  This is very different from the sheathed buoy construct that I had imagined, which presumably would be the kind of construct that a power buoy system entails.  If there are concerns about saltwater corrosion of the hydroelectric turbine, power buoys may still be desirable for their superior saltwater isolation profile (the saltwater doesn't have to contact anything corrodable for the power buoy to function).  Power buoys would also have the advantage of never accidentally feeding a fish into a turbine...  Buoys have gentler spirits, and you can hug them without getting hurt.

...gah!  My institutional access provisions don't let me get at the main contents of the paper.  I can't mimic their estimation methods precisely.  This study is being marketed to major institutions with an interest in it, like energy companies and governments.  I sympathize, but I think barriers like this interfere with the maturation of promising future energy technologies which humanity needs for potentially existential regions.  I'd try to pirate the paper in protest, but the search engine is currently down at the one academic piracy site I know, and I need to finish this essay today more than I need to do it perfectly.

I wonder if I can roughly estimate.  If I assume that the power output estimates for the Sibolga-Tapanuli Tengah plant were made with the mean power density, that yields (11.26+18)/2=14.63 w/m^2.  Is w/m^2 the same as the kW/m measure above?  I'm kind of confused by these measures and I wonder if they're being written consistently.  "Real" science is still hardly immune to error.  Sigh.  I'd know more if I had access to more research files, but it looks like a lot of the wave power stuff is really fenced off.  I think wave power researchers are out there with their harpoons hoping to spear some institutional whales, and I don't have that kind of money.  Yet.  ;)

So continuing forward with the assumption that their 464 kW estimate for tapered channel power was produced with an energy density estimate of 14.63, that's a relationship between 14.63 and 464.  Further continuing with these assumptions, their power buoy estimate of 128.8 kW would also be related to 14.63, as would their oscillating water colum (sic) estimate of 54.65.  484/14.63 yields a multiple of 31.7; 128.8/14.63 yields a multiple of 8.8; 54.65/14.63 yields a multiple of 3.7.  Applying the 8.8 multiple to the 4.1 wave density estimate available for an installation off of the coast of Cosenza yields 36.08 kW.  The average Italian home uses 3kW per hour, so an equivalently sized installation (how big?) to the one proposed in Sibolga-Tapanuli Tengah yields enough power to run 12 Italian homes.  Not very impressive, though in this application we would also be building a floating solar field.  Converted to hydrogen fuel output, this amount of wave energy would produce about 0.94 kilograms of hydrogen fuel per hour.  We can run it 24/7 and expect to sell arbitrary quantities of hydrogen at this output rate (this installation is not productive enough to disrupt the market, and may in fact be demand-stimulating), but hydrogen is only valued at about $0.70 per kilogram.  The yield value would be in the neighborhood of $6,000 per year.  Ouch.

I really don't have enough information to determine if there's a scale at which this is feasible.  How BIG is that power buoy system?  If it's small, a lot of them can be packed together and maintained together.  Every ten of them would yield a prosperous wage for an energy technician before the cost of maintainence, which should be minimal for an installation of ceramic power buoys.  With the corrosion resistant designs that I believe are possible, the only dearly needed maintenance for many years should be scraping barnacles off the buoys, though despite the potential for good weather isolation moving parts may still occasionally break in the attached generator when stressed by kinetic inputs from stormy weather.

...looking up power buoys directly kind of appalls me.  I immediately understand why corrosion is considered a serious issue.  As of 2012 an engineer working on wave power was seriously trying to use exposed metal components in the open ocean.  WHY?  Fortunately, the design I'm complaining about does come with some technical information.  It produces up to 500 watts per buoy, and was producing 400 watts in practice, and it was sited in an area which commonly observed 2 meter waves.  Wave heights in the mediterranean are between half a meter and 1 meter, so I would expect between half and a quarter output.  I'll call it 33%, yielding 133 watts per buoy.  Those buoys were 2.5 meters across.  Structural packing should be fairly arbitrary (it's not like the wave power extraction equipment can damp the ocean's fervor), so I'll imagine 3 m^2 berths for the sheathing around the buoys.  36 kW is 36,000 w, so we're looking at 270 buoys to generate that amount of power, and 2,700 buoys to generate ten times that amount, which would occupy 8,100 m^2.  I don't think this is feasible.  :/

Although I kind of wonder if this sort of thing could be built as the whole underside of a seastead colony.  A football field is 7,140 square meters, and the deck of an oil tanker sprawls across seven of them or more.  7x7,140=49,980, 49,980/3=16,660, and 16,660*133=2,215,780, which as a wattage becomes 2,215.78 when converted to kW.  That's not quite gigawatt scale power, but if it can be staffed efficiently and run continuously it produces 56.8 kilograms of hydrogen per hour, with a market value of $39 per hour.  Dedicating an amount of ocean the size of an oil tanker off the coast of Cosenza to power buoys could produce $347,434 in hydrogen fuel.  That's before accounting for the fact that the power buoys are the underside of a structure whose top layer is a solar field of similar surface area... although I've found an error in my math, which is that I'm assuming much too efficient a hydrogen fuel producer.  Correcting for the efficiency of the equipment actually on the market, the correct per-hour production rate is 46.1 kilograms of hydrogen per hour, with a market value of $32 per hour and a yearly output of $279,552.

I think this is still too low for a project that would require more metal than an oil tanker and ceramics to boot.  It's not even the operating costs that are killing it.  It's the payback period on the initial investment.  Hm...  I have no idea how much the solar field would add, and the online calculators are sorely unhelpful.  There are no readily available utility concept calculators which would tell the public how much power solar panels generate per unit surface area dedicated to utility power generation.

I've dug up website promoting solar-for-hydrogen.  That link is here: https://landartgenerator.org/blagi/archives/127

This claims that .2kW can be claimed by solar panels per square meter of land.  Our tanker-sized offshore power installation therefore produces 49,980*0.2kW of power, which is 9,996 kW.  This produces 208.25 kilograms of hydrogen per hour with a market value of $145.7 per hour, which adds to the buoys for a market production of $177.7 per hour, but only while the sun is shining.  It looks like the solar output of the installation exceeds the wave power output of the installation if it's built off the coast of Cosenza in marginal waters for tidal power, though citing the installation off the coast of Sardinia instead could slightly more than double the wave power output and concomitant hydrogen production.

Now, the problem is the payback period, as I mentioned.  Oil tankers cost millions.  The price is somewhat inflated by the strength of the oil industry, but in this context that's like fudge factor for my ceramics and skilled machining requirements.  I don't have as good an idea of oil tanker sizes as I would like to have in order to make this calculation, but I'll splat an estimate at $100 million.  Suddenly it takes 357 years to pay off from tidal power alone, and that's the value if you could run it without paying wages.  Assuming you have to pay two technicians to maintain it, and the return time is 627 years, which is absurdly beyond the expected lifespan of the materials involved.  I don't know how long the ceramics last, but you'd have to replace the hydrogen generators repeatedly over that interval.  This concept in this location looks like pure foolhardy nonsense...  In the more favorable vicinity of the Sardinian coast, the payoff period after paying wages is a less insane 284 years, but 'less insane' is a relative measure, because that still exceeds the lifespan of all the parts.  Any project that's expected to fit in the real world needs to pay off in less than a century, because centennial bonds already verge on madness and anything longer than that has gone diving off the cliffs of improbability.

I mean, it's not like we'll stop using hydrogen at any particular point in the future, so a centennial hydrogen fuel plant is not a crazy risk, but cost projections made that far in advance need risk-padding that makes them take even longer to run in the black.  Argh.  I spent all day on this, didn't find the numbers I needed, and cast serious doubt on the concept by the numbers I did find!

Surely I must have made many mistakes.  Real utility installations are expensive projects with long pay-off periods (and tidal power stations DO last a long time), but not like THIS.  Did I make enough mistakes to scavenge the concept?  Let's look at other tidal power stations.  The Sihwa tidal power station is the largest and most expensive tidal installation in the world, with a capacity of 254 mW and construction costs of $298 million.  It is located in a region with a tidal range of 5.6 meters...  Aha, tidal range is what this direct meters value is.  So the tidal range off the coast of Cosenza is 4.1 meters?  Which suggests 9 meters for Sardinia..?  Cripes, I wish I knew what my numbers meant.  A different map I've found suggests that the tidal range in the vicinity of Cosenza is a deeply unsatisfying 0.4 meters (and 0.3 near Sardinia), while affirming a 9 meter tidal range for Sihwa.  That suggests tidal power would not be feasible for Italy.

Reviewing other research on tidal energy in the Mediterranean, I'm finding commentary about local low energy levels hindering output, but also local mild conditions favoring long-term low-risk ventures.  AKA the equipment will last for many decades, but it will also underperform.  That's potentially okay, depending on the extent of the underperformance.  This document that I'm currently reading is actually dreadful boosterism desperate to sell marine energy as a vital aspect of policy, which amuses me; I appreciate it, and I can extract information from it despite the clear bias.  The point that it makes about the value of ocean energy as a means of increasing energy extraction while minimizing all landscape impacts is something that I appreciate as well.

What I really need to find in order to understand the viability of this technology is straightforward information regarding the potential convertibility of oceanic energy inputs to mechanical energy which we can use to make electricity.  On the basis of today's research, I think it's probable that deployment of oceanic energy technologies has been greatly slowed by a lack of clear and publicly available information regarding the conditions under which oceanic energy technologies can be deployed and for what yields.  The information that is available to me is not greatly inferior to the information that would be available to an aide researching on behalf of a municipality considering the implementation of potential local solutions to its power needs.
