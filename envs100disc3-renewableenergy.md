# Envs100disc3 RenewableEnergy

   - Topic: Renewable Energy
   - Instructions specify picking three sources of renewable energy and a country, then writing up (in three paragraphs) a plan to transition to those sources.
   - 1st paragraph: Name the country, name the three sources, and justify them.
   - 2nd paragraph: Further justification of the three chosen sources.
   - 3rd paragraph: How do you convince the public that these are the right three sources?
   - The per-paragraph specification on this essay makes it a little less fun and may increase the challenge.

I think I should write favoring hydrogen power storage.  I suspect that hydrogen fuel as a store of power for intermittent power systems is one of the most underutilized potentials on Earth.  I'm comfortable slotting that in as though it were one of the three sources that the essay is focusing on.
Intuitively therefore, the other two sources would be 'wind' and 'solar', the highly intermittent options.  I should spare a moment to look up renewables to make sure that's optimal.

Towards the target of focusing on new potentials...  Ooh.  Tidal, solar, and hydrogen would be a wonderful energy structure for a 'seastead' colony.  Starting out by building a reactor complex at sea that initially exports power (in the form of hydrogen fuel) would provide a rational/economical nucleation point for the seastead community to accrete around.  This could expand humanity's interception of solar energy across wholly new territories without displacing any current land use patterns.  The new green sea market actor would surely help create pressure towards updating international shipping for eco-friendly methods (international shipping is SO BAD for the environment today, old smoggy fuel-suckers predominate).
It's a little too ambitious for this.  I don't even know how to begin for planning the economics of it.  I'll do it anyways; it makes the essay fun, and I don't think the teacher will mark me down for overstepping.
Which country should I start in?  It has to be a wealthy country with coastline access.  I don't know if there's further specifications than that.  Maybe somewhere in the mediterranean so that the first offshore reactor complex doesn't have to face hurricane risks?  Greece might be appropriate.  There's no way the Grecian government can afford a project like this, but 1) their government is corrupt, and so might make the attempt anyways, and 2) if constructed as an international project it could be an opportunity to bring in international help.  The same considerations apply to Italy, which is a little less corrupt and a little less incapable of affording it, and actually has a better economic case for this; it could bring some vital new economic functioning to stagnating southern Italian cities which are presently hurting the nation's prestige and budget.  So...  Italy.  Although I think France has the best shot on Earth at being capable of building and operating such a system... so, France?  Except I think Italy would gain much more from the off-shore reactor complex.  Hm.  Do I go with the nation most likely to be capable of the project, or the nation with the most to gain should the project succeed?  It's a fair venture for an international project, and yet even as an international project, Italy gains most if it can get in first, and gains more than most applicable countries at that.  Europe is generally a stable place, though not without room for improvement; improving south Italian vitality would amend one of its potential instability factors.
