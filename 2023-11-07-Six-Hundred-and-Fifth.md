9:48.  20,845.

12:16.  Uhh...  20,845.  I haven't been working.  I fell back asleep.  I slept really poorly last night...

13:00.  21,411.  I bought a cheap spiced rum not too long ago.  It's not the best-tasting liquor I've ever had, but it is the best-tasting *cheap* liquor that I've ever had.  It's the only cheap liquor where I really just want to sip it neat rather than mixing it with anything.

13:40.  21,651.  806 words of progress.  I feel terrible today.  I forgot my medications last night and had to take them in the morning.  That's a bad omen for the day - there's a reason I usually time my meds to be right before going to sleep.

14:46.  I rested again.

15:37.  21,651.  Back to work.  I want to hit 1,667 words today.  I'm not being overly ambitious.

16:23.  I'm declaring a 15 hour fast.

16:57.  22,329.  1,484 words of progress.  Darn, I was hoping I'd hit par.

18:07.  23,206.  2,361 words of progress.  That's par.  I'm at a stall point, but I wonder if I'll break through it.

18:29.  23,236.  2,391 words of progress.  I'm still trying to work and I'm tweaking at it, but I'm not breaking through.  I'm going to take a break.

18:54.  Okay, I'm back.

19:41.  I've been reading a book.  No new ideas for my story.  I kinda want the subplot I'm working on to come to a head.

19:43.  Forget that fast.  I'm going to eat something.
