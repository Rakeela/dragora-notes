A parent was arrested today in Texas for posing as her daughter during a day at school.  I'm actually rather impressed.  A stunt like that gives over a lot of information about local conditions in the school, and in a manner that the school staff don't control.  I hope that crime inspires a few copycats, and not a lot of judicial punishment.

I'm still appalled by opposition to abortion rights.  Anyone born who *would have been* aborted under an unrestricted abortion scheme is not likely to have a wonderful childhood.  "Unplanned pregnancies" have a statistically significant correlation with domestic abuse.

I understand that religion is considered to require that abortion be banned.  I don't understand why religion would require the suffering of children, but it seems to be historically common.  Anti-abortion stances are just another version of child sacrifice.  Bad childhoods are a form of ritual sacrifice which deflects the wrath of God.  That's more important to religious people than protecting the most vulnerable in society.

Religious thinking on Earth seems to prize fecundity over child welfare.  I don't approve.

I looked at food prices today.  I do this occasionally, mostly because I believe keto foods are important for fighting obesity.  If keto dieting cost the same as ordinary eating, it'd be more popular.  I bet a lot of people are sticker shocking.  Price parity would promote all sorts of alternative diets, from vegetarianism to keto to lab-grown meat.

Our current generation is fat in part because it doesn't have the wealth that prior generations had.  We have more toys and gadgets, but every serious reform is unthinkably expensive.

I think some of the entrenched business operators need to have their assets seized, especially in food supply.  They're causing long-term generational impoverishment and making everyone poorer.  Conventional wisdom is that such policies cause famines.  I suspect that in nations where obesity is ruining productivity and hunger is negligible, what would actually happen is that productivity would increase as a result of such seizures, not despite but because of the resulting food supply disruptions.  In other words, I think America is fat enough that intentionally disrupting its own food supply with "bad socialist policies" would increase economic growth.

"Bad socialist policies" always have other objectives as well, and such disruptions would also enable reform of and scientific advancement in the food supply.  I think that would result in increasing the market power of newer, higher-quality foods.  There've been advancements in many fields, and the present market leaders have been dragging back the leading edge in the food industry.

At the very least, we should unleash regulators at the meat industry.  Let's *not* have the next pandemic arise from factory farming, please.

I wish humanity had the game of Contract which I had in my prior life.  It was a form of gamified economic analysis which (though usually played for fun rather than profit) was also intentionally real enough to be used to analyze real organizations.  We all knew business planning.  In this lifetime, I don't know business planning.

If the game of Contract was played on Earth, it would promote the formation of competitive new businesses, as well as a broader understanding of logistical costs.  My (human) mother's rants about how I didn't know the value of a dollar would be answerable.
