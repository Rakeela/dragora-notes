A parent was arrested today in Texas for posing as her daughter during a day at school.  I'm actually rather impressed.  A stunt like that gives over a lot of information about local conditions in the school, and in a manner that the school staff don't control.  I hope that crime inspires a few copycats, and not a lot of judicial punishment.
