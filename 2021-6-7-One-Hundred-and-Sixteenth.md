A parent was arrested today in Texas for posing as her daughter during a day at school.  I'm actually rather impressed.  A stunt like that gives over a lot of information about local conditions in the school, and in a manner that the school staff don't control.  I hope that crime inspires a few copycats, and not a lot of judicial punishment.

I'm still appalled by opposition to abortion rights.  Anyone born who *would have been* aborted under an unrestricted abortion scheme is not likely to have a wonderful childhood.  "Unplanned pregnancies" have a statistically significant correlation with domestic abuse.

I understand that religion is considered to require that abortion be banned.  I don't understand why religion would require the suffering of children, but it seems to be historically common.  Anti-abortion stances are just another version of child sacrifice.  Bad childhoods are a form of ritual sacrifice which deflects the wrath of God.  That's more important to religious people than protecting the most vulnerable in society.

Religious thinking on Earth seems to prize fecundity over child welfare.  I don't approve.
