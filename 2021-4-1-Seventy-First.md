It steps a little beyond the note I just added to [[notes-on-tolerogenic-dendritic-cells]], but I wonder if I could research 'cellular minimalism', trying to engineer functional transgenic cell lines which have knocked out as many of their functions as possible while still working for some purpose or another.  Would such cells have any advantages?

I woke up today feeling a little like I slept in an ocean of tears.  I had various dreams, and that was arguably the fourth of them.  The first of the night was both disturbing and disappointing; I can't recall it well enough to talk about it, and what little I do recall is not appealing.

The second was a little better.  I had a dream of a party to which a bunch of birds were invited, heh.  Most of the birds did not speak, and some were too skittish to join in the festivities at all, but merely perched on the balcony outside watching.  One of the birds was particularly colorful and affectionate; its head came to my hip, and it pressed against me as I stroked its iridescent feathers.

After the party had gone on for a while, there was a disruptive and ugly moment where ripples of harsh laughter filled the room, and I did not initially know why; looking for the source of the laughter, I discovered that the party-goers were mocking one of the more talkative birds for saying that everyone would be happy if they bred.  "Uplift wisdom!" jeered one of the attendees.  There had apparently been some brief discussion of what the meaning of happiness was occurring in the far side of the room; "Breed everyone!" had been the exuberant statement from one of the birds attending the party which had set the room into hysterics after being said quite loudly.  I disapproved very much of what the bird said, but I also greatly disliked the party-goers for reacting so *harshly* to it, so...  I left the party, which is to say I left the dream, to dream of something else.

I had four dreams last night, and the third I don't remember (though I remember sunlit streets and the dream's emotional tone seemed bright), but the fourth dream was that I dreamed I was sleeping in water.  I was also in my bedroom, which was half-flooded; I felt like I was in a dozy half-awake state, contemplating the decision that Kistaro and I had made to try sleeping in a flooded bedroom.  Impossibly, a wave moved through the room, and in my floating slumber I was pushed up against the bookshelves; it was no fierce impact, but rather I bobbed into the books, and thought, "Oh no!  We forgot about our books.  All of these must be ruined by water now."

From there I awoke for real, and though my dreams were fine overall, still I've been sniffling teary-eyed this morning, feeling like a hulk of wasted potential.

Mel - or rather, his "dragon elf" character, whose name I've forgotten - presented Bonobianism as a solution for world peace.  As though there was some fuck-or-fight dichotomy that could be settled towards fucking forever.  I don't want to fuck *or* fight.  I want to read, study, and experience.  I want to build worlds *bigger* than just fucking and fighting.

In [[The-Viceroy]], the Commonwealth has natalist policies, reproductive mandates, and nationalist indoctrination in the same tech tree that contains basic incomes, leisure subsidies, and radical policing.  They're Mel-style "pacifists", enforcing their fucking-not-fighting future.  Except that some of the people they're enforcing it *against* want neither fucking nor fighting, and there's no place in the Commonwealth for that.

The Empire in that game can tolerate people who don't want to fuck or fight... but they're dishonest, homogenizing, and their territories fall in the ugly brutality that they call 'justice'.

I attended a video conference chocolate tasting with Kistaro and Kistaro's coworkers.  I didn't participate much; I was intimidated to speak to that audience.  I got to see a few of Kistaro's coworkers.  I doubt I'll remember their names.

I finished the tasting feeling sick, which surprised me.  I have a tremendous appetite for sweets.  I also finished it with a very strong protein craving and I felt like I'd feel better with some protein, so I lobbied for a burger delivery, and we put the order in.  The place we ordered from had soft pretzels on the menu, so I ordered one of those as well.

Sometimes I like to think about how my tastes have changed over time.  Pretzels, for instance, were bland when I was a kid.  (I still think dry/hard pretzels have no flavor save salt.)  At some point, soft pretzels and pretzel bread took on a delicate flavor that I've found pleasure in ever since.  The same thing happened to sugar cookies; despite my love of sugar, I only started liking sugar cookies in adulthood.

Conversely, when I was a kid I couldn't tolerate spicy foods, which isn't to say I disliked them.  I could be brought to tears by 'mild' food, which is an awesome sensitivity whose fading I kind of regret, but even so I really enjoyed the flavors.  As I pushed into the challenge, my tolerance increased.  Today I suspect I have 'average' spice tolerance.  I don't like pain-flavored foods, but I pick up a lot of flavor notes in moderately spicy foods, and there's a tearjerking take on Basil Fried Rice that one of the local Thai restaurants sells.  It's pretty much amazing despite going over my usual limit.

There's a few things I've lost my taste for, too.  Um, none of them come to mind right now, but a quiet note of anxiety is what prompted me to write this up.  Even though my love of sugar is trouble for my health, I hope I never lose my taste for sweets.  It just seems like it would be strange to be *me* without liking sweets.

I read an article about how falling populations will lead to stagnating technology, and it's hard to overstate how extreme my frustration is with that concept.  It's brutally primitive.  The article concludes by proposing that we should be investing in welfare and encouraging people to breed in poverty so that we can exploit their brains, to create an 'expanding cosmos' where populations swell forever.

It's horrific.

It's also unrealistic.

It's like something taken straight out of The Viceroy, where people only ever have a certain amount of thought to contribute, prolonged stagnation is necessary to implement basic technologies, and the only way to get more thought out of people is to invest in super-expensive infrastructure and/or ever-growing absurd population levels.  The idea that we should do that is very 'Commonwealth IRL' and it would lead to a primitive disaster IRL, where we have to deal with 1) resource limits, and 2) people who want meaningful lives rather than being treated as breeding cattle.  Cattleizing the welfare classes to try to farm them for science would result in a lot of molested kids, who (like me but worse) would be impaired in their ability to contribute to scientific progress.  I don't think it would be scientifically productive *at all*.  I wouldn't be surprised if attempting that resulted in civilization on Earth collapsed in civil war.

"People change" isn't just a comment about the validity of criminal rehabilitation and the potential for rehabilitation in relationships that only moderately suck.  It's also a comment about the nature of technical ability in the populous.  As people live, they accumulate talents to the best of their ability, and they *constantly* generate ideas.  The whole reason why our economy undervalues ideas and treats idea producers as disposable trash is that idea generation *is* incessant in society.  Yet a corrollary of this problem is that if you give people life extension, *they will constantly gain technical ability*.  More and more petty automations will be implemented, more and more durable solutions will be implemented, and people will be seeking new challenges as they surmount old ones.  The continuation of this process already contributes massively to development in the stable first world societies on Earth.  It's real!

We don't need and shouldn't want ever-growing populations.  That road yields up only entropy and death.  It exponentiates suffering and crushes science.  What we really need to do in order to keep science growing is to create conditions of ever-growing lifespans.  The process of people surmounting challenges and solving issues only stops and starts regressing because people get **old**.  If we can make people stop getting old, we can make that process continue indefinitely, and personal development will yield up a growing ability for every person to contribute to humanity's scientific potential.

Natalists would lead everyone to death, because they can't value life enough to understand that people *think* over time.  Why are we all supposed to suffer because of a minority of people who think that every individual mind is limited, shallow, finite, and disposable?  Why should the IRL equivalent of the Commonwealth be permitted to destroy society?

As long as people live, they think.  As long as people think in conditions of freedom, they change.  As long as people change, science advances.  That's the true liberation which the first world has achieved.  Feudal stagnation happened only because of a swordpoint society where people weren't thinking in conditions of freedom - and note that those feudal societies were *extremely* natalistic.  In the Viceroy, I value the Commonwealth for its contribution to the public weal, yet the Commonwealth IRL and in that game would trap society in feudalism *forever* if they were allowed to control policy.

I'm just going to emphasize this again, feudal societies were ALL natalistic.  Babymaking was a core obligation of the peasantry, who were considered defective and marked for death if they didn't reproduce.  Their children were the living weapons of the Lords, who decreed that society would stagnate if they didn't have masses of peasants... and so society stagnated WITH masses of peasants, because having more people didn't solve their problems.  -_-

Seriously, IRL Earth was at its most 'Commonwealth' centuries ago.  It's like the Commonwealth ideology was implemented *without* the parts that actually make it good, which are the Leisure Subsidies and Basic Income programs.  Leisure and income protections help people achieve the conditions of freedom which make them avid and changeable thinkers.  Instead, Earth implemented creches, suffrages, universities, invasive policing, reproductive mandates, and nationalist indoctrination programs, with that last one generating vast genetic scars of rape and war.

Earth also implemented natalism and natalism and natalism and natalism; in the 1800s relationships that we would consider pedophilic were normalized!  Humans didn't stop molesting kids until we STOPPED honoring parenting!

We can't go back on that.  Embracing natalism leads to constant horrific warfare.  We've already BEEN through that, for THOUSANDS OF YEARS.  Humanity spent all that time honoring parenting, and yet we as a species didn't stop molesting kids until about two centuries ago, when humans started prioritizing child welfare more than they prioritized babymaking.  Suddenly birth rates went down as prosperity shot up.  Unmolested children make smarter adults who have fewer kids. 

Scientific progress is a reward of NOT being natalistic.

Because they were apparently obsessed with the idea that only a narcissist would have refused whoever-the-hell I refused sex to, the people who stalked me treated everything I became interested in as though I believed that I could change the world from nowhere with no resources and assistance.  In other words, total arrogance; how could I believe I was worth anything at all?

Having had so many people try to convince me that I'll never be anything but a worthless slut, I've actually got a great well of faith that the world will carry on with or without me.  TBH it's not even to the credit of people insulting me, because I had that trait in childhood.  That humility was what made me willing to accept the feedback that transhumanity needed me to promote sex, instead of research.  I was willing to be told, "Just wait.  Things will get better."  I was willing to be told that the true hedonism was sexual hedonism, even though I didn't enjoy it myself.

As a good performer would say that they enjoyed it, I was willing to say I enjoyed it.  I said I enjoyed it, but I also spoke of my pain, uncertainty, exhaustion, general crippling stress and anxiety during sexual encounters, and my notable preference to be doing other things.  The people who suffered under "my" sexual demands also mocked me for saying that I preferred videogames to sex, not realizing that by expressing a preference for videogames *I meant that I preferred not to be sexually engaged with them*.

Although it was punished emotionally by sudden rude obsessions and also shaming for the "authoritarianism" of disliking anything sexual, I was occasionally even willing to say that I was uncomfortable with specific fetishes and performances.  Punishing me for all expressions of discomfort was part of what made it possible to coerce me into performing truly repulsive scenes.

Bad memories.  Tch.

People who would think me narcissistic for refusing the "help" of sexual abusers and "mistreating" the "virtuous" people who came to my "aid" should not be important decision-makers in this world.  I have no power to take such people *out* of power, but other people *do* have that power.  Indeed, AFAIK the people who were recruited to punish me were *people who punish sexual abusers*, as though I were a sexual abuser myself...  Funny, how many sexual abusers in this world put as much effort into wriggling out of sex?  I don't think recruiting people like that to take down someone like me was at all clever.

As Jacel would likely not even be the only person to attest, I was even prone to dropping scenes abruptly at the first opportunity, distraction, or basic excuse.  Like a couple of other people, Jacel never put two and two together well enough to realize that was because *I didn't want sex*.  Jacel was notably intolerant of all "I don't like sex" feedback out of me, like some of the people who in hindsight I think were stalking me to sexually exploit me.  I wasn't allowed to be disliking sex honestly, I had to be "lying" about disliking sex...

Perhaps I was so slutty that I overflowed the slutometer and became the one true nega-slut, hah!

The fact that I was supposed to promote sex for transhumanism's sake may have fed into my hostility to the idea that research has *any* requirement for natalism.  What we need is life extension in a free society.  I didn't start out antinatalist, but natalists have already *had* their chance with *me*.
