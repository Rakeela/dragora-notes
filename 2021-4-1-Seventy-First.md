It steps a little beyond the note I just added to [[notes-on-tolerogenic-dendritic-cells]], but I wonder if I could research 'cellular minimalism', trying to engineer functional transgenic cell lines which have knocked out as many of their functions as possible while still working for some purpose or another.  Would such cells have any advantages?

I woke up today feeling a little like I slept in an ocean of tears.  I had various dreams, and that was arguably the fourth of them.  The first of the night was both disturbing and disappointing; I can't recall it well enough to talk about it, and what little I do recall is not appealing.

The second was a little better.  I had a dream of a party to which a bunch of birds were invited, heh.  Most of the birds did not speak, and some were too skittish to join in the festivities at all, but merely perched on the balcony outside watching.  One of the birds was particularly colorful and affectionate; its head came to my hip, and it pressed against me as I stroked its iridescent feathers.

After the party had gone on for a while, there was a disruptive and ugly moment where ripples of harsh laughter filled the room, and I did not initially know why; looking for the source of the laughter, I discovered that the party-goers were mocking one of the more talkative birds for saying that everyone would be happy if they bred.  "Uplift wisdom!" jeered one of the attendees.  There had apparently been some brief discussion of what the meaning of happiness was occurring in the far side of the room; "Breed everyone!" had been the exuberant statement from one of the birds attending the party which had set the room into hysterics after being said quite loudly.  I disapproved very much of what the bird said, but I also greatly disliked the party-goers for reacting so *harshly* to it, so...  I left the party, which is to say I left the dream, to dream of something else.

I had four dreams last night, and the third I don't remember (though I remember sunlit streets and the dream's emotional tone seemed bright), but the fourth dream was that I dreamed I was sleeping in water.  I was also in my bedroom, which was half-flooded; I felt like I was in a dozy half-awake state, contemplating the decision that Kistaro and I had made to try sleeping in a flooded bedroom.  Impossibly, a wave moved through the room, and in my floating slumber I was pushed up against the bookshelves; it was no fierce impact, but rather I bobbed into the books, and thought, "Oh no!  We forgot about our books.  All of these must be ruined by water now."

From there I awoke for real, and though my dreams were fine overall, still I've been sniffling teary-eyed this morning, feeling like a hulk of wasted potential.

Mel - or rather, his "dragon elf" character, whose name I've forgotten - presented Bonobianism as a solution for world peace.  As though there was some fuck-or-fight dichotomy that could be settled towards fucking forever.  I don't want to fuck *or* fight.  I want to read, study, and experience.  I want to build worlds *bigger* than just fucking and fighting.

In [[The-Viceroy]], the Commonwealth has natalist policies, reproductive mandates, and nationalist indoctrination in the same tech tree that contains basic incomes, leisure subsidies, and radical policing.  They're Mel-style "pacifists", enforcing their fucking-not-fighting future.  Except that some of the people they're enforcing it *against* want neither fucking nor fighting, and there's no place in the Commonwealth for that.

The Empire in that game can tolerate people who don't want to fuck or fight... but they're dishonest, homogenizing, and their territories fall in the ugly brutality that they call 'justice'.

I attended a video conference chocolate tasting with Kistaro and Kistaro's coworkers.  I didn't participate much; I was intimidated to speak to that audience.  I got to see a few of Kistaro's coworkers.  I doubt I'll remember their names.

I finished the tasting feeling sick, which surprised me.  I have a tremendous appetite for sweets.  I also finished it with a very strong protein craving and I felt like I'd feel better with some protein, so I lobbied for a burger delivery, and we put the order in.  The place we ordered from had soft pretzels on the menu, so I ordered one of those as well.

Sometimes I like to think about how my tastes have changed over time.  Pretzels, for instance, were bland when I was a kid.  (I still think dry/hard pretzels have no flavor save salt.)  At some point, soft pretzels and pretzel bread took on a delicate flavor that I've found pleasure in ever since.  The same thing happened to sugar cookies; despite my love of sugar, I only started liking sugar cookies in adulthood.

Conversely, when I was a kid I couldn't tolerate spicy foods, which isn't to say I disliked them.  I could be brought to tears by 'mild' food, which is an awesome sensitivity whose fading I kind of regret, but even so I really enjoyed the flavors.  As I pushed into the challenge, my tolerance increased.  Today I suspect I have 'average' spice tolerance.  I don't like pain-flavored foods, but I pick up a lot of flavor notes in moderately spicy foods, and there's a tearjerking take on Basil Fried Rice that one of the local Thai restaurants sells.  It's pretty much amazing despite going over my usual limit.

There's a few things I've lost my taste for, too.  Um, none of them come to mind right now, but a quiet note of anxiety is what prompted me to write this up.  Even though my love of sugar is trouble for my health, I hope I never lose my taste for sweets.  It just seems like it would be strange to be *me* without liking sweets.
