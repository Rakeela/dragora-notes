The amount of sequential calculations involved in determining which action potentials are feasible is astonishing.  It's interesting and fun; I think people don't present enough of this in the category of making math fun.  I think the fear is that it's overwhelming, yet I think it's awesome.  The sheer tonnage of metal involved in covering a region of the ocean with mirror-drones to alter the weather...  I haven't done the calculations consciously yet; I'm still savoring the improbability of something far from my ability.

I was reading about Honduran migrants today when I was reminded of the mirror-drones by the mention of migrants displaced by hurricanes.  If we could dissipate extreme storms, people could build more stable lives in less stable regions, and the cultivation of virtue in those regions would be easier.  As those societies develop with less disruption, they would grow wealthier and stabler.  Eventually, the priority of preventing disruptions in that area would drop, and the most economical use of the mirror-drone fleet would be elsewhere.  Fortunately then, a mirror-drone fleet would be a global resource readily reprioritized according to its most vital application wherever that may be found...  This redeployability is part of what I think makes it a sensible investment for a world, despite the megatonnage of metal involved in creating it.

Yet how many megatons of metal are involved?  The question is awe-inspiring.  I don't know how to approach it.  It's a question of iterative estimation where the error range on the estimate might span orders of magnitude.  I don't think mirror-drones would require exotic resources.  They aren't prohibitively complex to design or operate.  Maybe we could extend the lifespan of individual drones by coating them in glass-ceramics or something, but I'm not sure that's needed at base.  If the computational resources of the fleet are minimized (as by centralization of control nodes), it might even be constructible in a way that minimizes its rare earth requirements.  It's a steel answer to a moist problem.  We've plated so much of the earth's surface in metal that I don't believe it would be beyond humanity's ability to move enough steel... but would it work?  Would there be enough international cooperation?  I don't think Honduras could afford enough mirror-drones to do hurricane-quelling.  I'm not sure Honduras could even afford enough mirror-drones to do precipitation-modifying local experimentation.  If the societies of Earth want the people of Honduras to not have their buildings blown down by hurricanes, that investment needs to be funded collectively by much larger, wealthier nations.

If it would work, I think it would be worth it.  Reducing forced migration from adverse weather events would reduce global tensions.  Moreover, it would reduce global pandemic risks; illegal migration is migration that hides from health authorities.
