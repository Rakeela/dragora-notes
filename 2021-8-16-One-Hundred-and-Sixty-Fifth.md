I have a job!  Sort of.  I'm now formally linked to something resume-worthy as a volunteer on a research project.  I don't understand yet what I'm supposed to do as a research assistant, so presently I've been studying research documents to try to form a current understanding of the material.  I'm reasonably confident that this is the correct thing for me to be doing!  The listing suggests 4 hours a week is a reasonable commitment, but I think I'm likely to give it 4 hours a day while I can.  I'm well behind the minimum expected education level for the position; additional hours of studying will help compensate for that.
