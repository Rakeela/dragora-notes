#2022-12-03-Three-Hundred-and-Second

Thoughts float through my mind repetitiously and inaccurately.  Things I've done recently seem to overwrite too much of my mind.  It's not torment of itself, but it's disappointing.  There's a sense of loss when I notice it.  It happened again in a small way as I was creating this file.  I started to type in 2022-11-03 as though I were creating this file for last month.  The pattern from last month's daily day-posts is still strong in my mind.

There are worse manifestations of the same phenomenon.  I'm tempted sometimes to do the same things for too long, and then thoughts from that thing intrude on everything else.  I have to be careful to give myself a varied activity budget, lest chaos be added to my thoughts.

Creating a new file for today's writing, so I'm starting from 0 words.  Today's writing goal is 961 words.  It's down from 980 because I did more than necessary yesterday.  Instead of attempting an even par every day, I'm going to attempt the sliding estimate every day.  I still expect to overshoot daily, so the quota should decline across the course of the month.

Making an adjustment to a prior file.  6,614 words to 6,615 words.  +1 words of progress, heh.

550 words of progress, so 551.  410 words remaining.

1,204 words of progress.  243 words over quota.  I'm not quite satisfied.  My writing is better at this lower pace, but I feel like I should be able to charge ahead and write the next scene, too.  Yet I also feel thick-headed.  I'm having trouble imagining the next scene.  If this were November writing, I'd definitely keep going.  Should I now?

1,582 words of progress.  378 more words than I had before.  I'm tabulating them this way, because I already reported the 1,204 words earlier.

Nanowrimo's website reports that at my current rate of output, I'll be done on December 24th.  I want to think that I'll speed up.
