I just thought of something wildly political that I want to preserve for future thought.

Consider this contrast between violent protests 'burning down the cities' in poor urban areas, and that violent protest which attacked the capitol itself:
1.  The group rioting across the nation, separately from whether they were behaving sanely or not, were by and large acting within their *own* communities.
2.  The group which rioted in the capitol, again independently of whether the behavior was sane, were trying to be in *everyone's* communities.  They went straight to the top with their violent disruptiveness.

This stands out to me, because I think that a lot of community problems aren't at all more solved when people upset with them try to take down central governments.  Most people, even if you restrict it to most people on the low side of wealthy, do not have problems bigger than their city.
