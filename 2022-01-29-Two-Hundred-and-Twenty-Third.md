I've dreamed a few times of an insectoid with jagged limbs and too many such limbs.  They've done me no harm in the dreams that I've had of them, but I've been singularly horrible to them.  In one such dream, I fought to keep it from touching me.  In another...  I cried for what I did to the creature in the most recent of these...  I killed it horribly, and only on waking did I realize that the creature had been attempting to give me a gift...

I want to have one of those dreams again, only this time I want to have the presence of mind to remain peaceful.  I am a lawful pacifist!  I would not harm a creature merely for having a frightening appearance.  Why did I have to abuse those creatures in the dreams I had of them?

I want to have more dreams of peaceful contact with aliens, in general.  I'm not sure I understand why I'm thinking of this right now.  I haven't had any of those dreams for some time...

I've been miserable lately, exhausted beyond all tolerance, and sleeping too much.
