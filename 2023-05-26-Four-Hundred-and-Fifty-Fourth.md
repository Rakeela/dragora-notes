04:36.  I dreamed of being a hivemind king with a pepper-loving myopic dragon in my employ.  The dragon was my most powerful 'unit' in a sort of strategy game being played.  It was also one of my only independently willful units.

04:38.  I've left my favorite sweater in the laundry repeatedly.  I keep forgetting to move it over to the dryer, so I keep rewashing it.  I'm taking a note here in self-shaming of sorts and partially also in self-reminder; I do keep these notes up all day long.

04:39.  It's much too early to be awake, but I woke up very cleanly, estimated it was about 04:00, and then checked the clock a few minutes after making the estimate to discover it was 04:18.  So I decided to just call it morning.

04:40.  I slept downstairs instead of showering last night, because my hips and feet were hurting.  I didn't want to stand in the shower.  I only walked six hours today and at an unimpressive pace, yet I was left feeling like I'd over-exercised.  So of course, now I'm back on the treadmill...

05:34.  I remembered to move the laundry over this time!  Finally, my sweater shall be available again.  Not that I need it in the summer, but I love it.

05:41.  I've just finished doing morning stuff, but I'm going to try to lay back down instead.

9:09.  More pleasant dreams.  One of them had me wake up and do web-searches.  I was checking for a cartoon that, alas, only existed in the dream.  I've just had a "Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Brookie" and it tasted more like salt than peanut butter.  Saltiest brookie, brownie, or cookie I've ever had.  Still pretty tasty.

9:18.  When I got up around 04:18, I thought I'd be making a super-early start to my day.

9:20.  I'm putting the treadmill away.

9:51.  I put the treadmill away and I wasted half an hour.  I swear the thing helps me focus.  Well, I don't really swear it.  I'm not sure.  I think maybe it helps me focus.  Anyways.  Time to get to work.  I have 16,288 words on Kura and Kaire, and I have another 73,712 to go.  If I did the remainder at 1,400 words per day it would take me another 52 days.  I work a bit faster than that, though not hugely faster than that.

9:53.  16,288.  1,534 words on the chapter.

10:28.  16,487.  1,733 words on the chapter.  199 words of progress.  I want to buy "Lenny and Larry's Peppermint Chocolate" cookies for my hoard, but I've gotten foul products from Lenny and Larry's brand before.  I've gotten really good cookies from that brand, too.  The experience of having some of the best and some of the worst cookies I've ever eaten from the same source fills me with ambivalence about ever buying them again.

11:58.  17,248.  2,490 words on the chapter.  960 words of progress.  

12:25.  I got up to make myself an espresso, and then I got sucked into a conversation about vitamins with Kistaro.  I take a multivitamin most days, and I separately supplement with vitamin D and vitamin K.  Kistaro says vitamin D deficiency is ubiquitous, and I've read that vitamin K deficiency is common among vegetarians.

12:39.  17,298.  2,540 words on the chapter.  1,010 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  Back to writing Kura.

13:42.  It is difficult to imagine math study as it was in early histories.  All the basics of math seem very obvious to me, and seemed very obvious to me in every year of public schooling prior to geometry.  I came up with the idea of negative numbers when I was in kindergarten.  Later, algebra made perfect sense the instant I was exposed to it.  How did these things take so long to develop in history?

13:56.  Okay, I'm demoralized.  Unless demoralized is the wrong word.  I'm kinda lost in thought.  Kura is being tempted by Kulgi.

14:19.  18,616.  1,316 words on the chapter.  2,328 words of progress.

14:23.  I took a very brief break to read a few more pages of The Wearle.  Every page is a struggle in this book.  It is not technically hard to read.

14:43.  I am stalled in Kura and Kaire.  I am still thinking about Kura's thoughts.  I feel like this is a breach point where she should do something different.

15:55.  19,530.  2,237 words on the chapter.  3,242 words of progress.

16:30.  19,787.  2,494 words on the chapter.  3,499 words of progress.  Oh come on.  Six words?  I brought the chapter to a nice close six words short of quota?

16:37.  19,806.  2,513 words on the chapter.  3,518 words of progress.  I've been watching a movie while working.  It's surprisingly good for my productivity.  Lowers stress.  Keeps my thoughts movie.  At the same time, I've only written like 300 words in the last hour and a half, so "this is good for my productivity" may be illusory.

16:42.  Comedy.  I don't actually like comedy.  The writing is distracting me from the movie, and the movie is distracting me from the writing.

16:48.  19,808.  3,520 words of progress.  I just put the next chapter header on, heh.  I think I'm done for today.

17:00.  19,809.  3,521 words of progress.  I added one word in 12 minutes.

17:13.  19,813.  3,525 words of progress.  I keep thinking I'm done, and I keep rereading it and tweaking it.  2,518 on the chapter.  I should be studying chapter 6 so I'm ready to write chapter 8.

17:46.  20,134.  321 words on the chapter.  3,846 words of progress.

19:13.  21,265.  1,268 words on the chapter.  4,977 words of progress.  Maybe I should stop for the night...

19:18.  21,269.  1,268 words on the chapter.  4,981 words of progress.  Something jumped out at me in a previous chapter.

19:19.  21,270.  1,269 words on the chapter.  4,982 words of progress.  Rearranged a few words.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I feel out of ideas for the night.

19:25.  21,269.  1,268 words on the chapter.  4,981 words of progress.  I am pecking unproductively at this work.

19:28.  This is so much more of a gryphon story now.  I'm even working on gryphon body language.

22:13.  I bought soft top cookies!  They're near their sell-by date.  These are quite perishable, moreso than other kinds of cookies, due to the moisture they carry.  I plan to eat two of them per day until I run out or they go bad.

22:14.  I feel much better today.  I did only 1 mile of walking, burning an estimated 197 kcal, taking 4,027 steps.  I walked for 54 minutes and 50 seconds.

22:15.  I wrote a bunch today, but I feel like I didn't get enough book reading done.

22:42.  I keep thinking that maybe I can give The Wearle two stars, and it keeps letting me down again.
