I don't like gamblers.  If I could ban gambling with nobody offended, and I knew that were possible, I'd do it.

I recognize gambling as a peaceful conduct that shouldn't be banned, but I consider it to be primitive, exploitative, and essentially an example of what dies when influence strengthens.  If people have the capacity of creating a world oriented towards truth, which drives out those who would manipulate, exploit, and tear down systems, I don't think they end up preferring gamblers much.

The impulse that drives people to establish gambling facilities is quintessentially authoritarian: it is the desire to destroy consensuality by abusing the will of other people to force them to make predictably bad decisions.  All this is true, but gambling itself is a voluntary conduct.  So I see it as something that lives next to authoritarianism, but not something that is itself authoritarian.  I just have trouble imagining that people who would do such a thing could exist without secretly imagining themselves the righteous masters of others, who deserve all access unlimited to overwrite the wills of other people.

One of the better aspects of human psychology is also one of the more anomalous.  Among humans, people who favor surveillance typically oppose gambling, and people who favor gambling typically oppose surveillance.  This doesn't 'make sense' to me, because surveillors also bet on peoples' behavior.  The institution of pre-crime programs is based on gambling (about the behavior of suspects), for instance, and it is an example of the authoritarianism of the 'house'.  I suspect the anomaly here is reconciled when you consider the historic hypocrisy of the virtuous angels (so to speak) that humanity has tended to put on the hidden side of the camera.  The trope of the gambling agent, who isn't in the gambling den to investigate, but who just considers it fun...  I think it may be a real thing.

Anyone who would overwrite the will of other people will eventually fall afoul of the most unethical act, because the pinnacle of overwritten wills is the simulated will.

To preserve the will... seems like it requires society to press gently against gambling.  To promote gambling is to act in diametric opposition to the development of the will.  It is inherently selfish and hostile to the will of all others.  One person may decide that their will is superior and that they cannot be denied by the will of others... that's authoritarian!  That's simply the rapist's will to rape, and it cannot exist in a perfectly reciprocal community dedicated to the principle of the will.  If to establish a house of gambling truly embodies that will to deny to other people the development of *their* will, then there is but one reason why a perfectly reciprocal community built upon the principle of the will would not need to *ban* gambling: by failing to *contain* gamblers.

As I consider the development of the will essential to the fully reciprocal ethic, I don't like gambling.  I dreamed of gamblers last night.  It was a good dream, but I'd rather it never happens again.  I hope someday we'll have a dream reeve service so that dreams become consensual and can contribute to the development of the will.
