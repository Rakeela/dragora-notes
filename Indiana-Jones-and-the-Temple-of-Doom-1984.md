I'm not sure if I've seen this one before.

This looks pretty unfamiliar, I think I'm watching it for the first time ever today.

This movie isn't a favorite.

I had seen before the scene with the Ark killing the Nazis, but everything else in the movie was unfamiliar, so I don't think I'd ever watched the movie properly before.
