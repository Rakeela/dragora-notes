This is a stub for a concept.  Using my notes from IIoTV, I'm considering putting together a setting that talks about my concept of three factions organized to search together (albeit rivalrously) for potentially qualified immortals.  The setting would be titled "Eternity's Harvest" and being "harvested" would be a good thing for a change.
