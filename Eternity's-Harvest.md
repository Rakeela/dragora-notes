This is a stub for a concept.  Using my notes from IIoTV, I'm considering putting together a setting that talks about my concept of three factions organized to search together (albeit rivalrously) for potentially qualified immortals.  The setting would be titled "Eternity's Harvest" and being "harvested" would be a good thing in this context.  Since I'd be writing my own story, the success rate could be much higher although the path would still be long.  A thousand years of supported candidate immortality is not a grevious burden.

This would potentially be an Orion's Arm setting.  I'm not going to study Orion's Arm quite that studiously just yet, but it's hard for me to imagine so many different levels of intelligence coexisting without trial grounds of some kind or another.

I was thinking that this would also justify a review of the IIoTV stuff which would reconsider each technology in terms of what kind of virtues it would "harvest".  It's been hard to get going though, as I immediately started reviewing Distributed Intelligence.  Distributed Intelligence strikes me as such a complex *metaphor* in The Viceroy, that if I give it to the three factions (the psuedo-Panarchic, the psuedo-Commonwealth, and the pseudo-Imperial) they'll each have their own *totally different* idea for what to use in that "slot".  So do I then put in one technology for review, or three?  Maybe I should start by reviewing what the factions would be.

Factions:
1.  Hyperconsensuals
	1.  This replaces the Panarchy.  They believe that paradisic societies should be organized without coercive force, including without state coercion, ie they believe in voluntary tax codes.  Category of sought immortal: true believers in voluntarism.
	2.  The hyperconsensuals believe in a whole lot of cultural power to try to get people to pay taxes without being **coerced** to pay taxes.  Category of sought immortal: very persuasive people.
	3.  The hyperconsensuals also value people who are placidly dedicated to (and willing to continue paying for) specific programs that the hyperconsensuals are already running.  Category of sought immortal: people who love specific programs enough to pay for them voluntarily.
	4.  Since running people in software "only costs electricity", one of the categories of people who the hyperconsensuals have a special love for are the extremely efficient people who are willing to live in pure simulation.  Category of sought immortal:  true believers in simulationism.
	5.  Since they have a lot of hyper-efficient simulated people to keep entertained, the hyperconsensuals also prize entertainers.  This dovetails with their pursuit of influential people for taxpaying purposes.  Category of sought immortal: simulation programmers.
	6.  The hyperconsensuals have a grave fear of false conviction in their ideology, as imprisonment is a grave offense of forcible interconnection, namely the interconnection of the criminal and the criminal punishment system.  They do not oppose lawful conviction, but they do try to ensure that no false convictions occur.  Category of sought immortal:  Lawyers, especially defense lawyers.
2.  Planet Builders
	1.  This replaces the Empire.  The planet builders believe that society is defined by its outputs, and they never want to give up trying to increase productivity, even if that means they end up producing useless things like new planetary bodies on which dwell people they'll never meet.  Category of sought immortal:  True believers in productivism.
	2.  The planet builders usually believe in nonconsensual taxation.  One of the more prosaic kinds of people they need is therefore auditors.  The conflict between taxpayer and auditor proceeds forever in this society.  Category of sought immortal: accountants and auditors.
	3.  As in the hyperconsensuals, people who are placidly dedicated to (and willing to continue paying for) specific programs that the planet builders are already running are valued.  Everyone loves these people if they can *believe* in them; the planet builders believe in these less often than the hyperconsensuals, but do want them when they're convinced.  Category of sought immortal: people who love specific programs enough to pay for them voluntarily.  
	4.  In order to maximize productivity, many people are necessarily dedicated to inferior roles under superior direction.  The planet builders are thus pre-eminent protectors of those who do not even *wish* to govern themselves, but who seek immortality under someone else's direction.  Category of sought immortal: mushroom people who will just follow orders even when they think they might be getting fed shit and kept in the dark.
	5.  Massive industrial organization requires pulling on skills and resources from massively disparate areas, as the planet builders imagine it.  This means massive investments such as space elevators and even the hollowing out of existing worlds to increase available surface area.  Category of sought immortal:  Logisticians and miners.
	6.  The massively productive engines of the planet builders demand swift and efficient justice be performed so as not to tangle the gears of their vast economic pursuits.  They have a utilitarian approach to jurisprudence and seek to be correct on average rather than correct in every case.  Category of sought immortal:  Lawyers, especially prosecutors.
3.  Unioneers
	1.  This replaces the Commonwealth.  The unioneers believe that the purpose of sapience is to be happy, and that all technology is ultimately the search for the alleviation of misery and attainment of superior happiness.  Category of sought immortal: people who make others happy.
	2.  The unioneers usually believe in nonconsensual taxation.  One of the more prosaic kinds of people they need is therefore auditors.  The conflict between taxpayer and auditor proceeds forever in this society.  Category of sought immortal: accountants and auditors.
	3.  As in the hyperconsensuals, people who are placidly dedicated to (and willing to continue paying for) specific programs that the planet builders are already running are valued.  Everyone loves these people if they can *believe* in them; the unioneers believe in these less often than the hyperconsensuals, but do want them when they're convinced.  Category of sought immortal: people who love specific programs enough to pay for them voluntarily.  
	4.  To increase the sum total happiness of the cosmos, areas that are fully happy are encouraged to increase in population to guide others to their state.  Their most developed areas strive to increase in liveable surface area accordingly.  Category of sought immortal: megastructure builders.
	5.  As the Unioneers believe in massively cooperative psychology, they want to identify people who work well with distant others.  Category of sought immortal: cultural travellers.
	6.  The Unioneers have a delicate attitude towards law, considering that legal protections are essential to the protection of *liberty itself*, since all crimes are violations of the rights of the victim.  They balance this with the concern that the law should not *itself* violate liberty, since all false convictions are violations of the rights of the accused.  Category of sought immortal:  Lawyers, especially judges.

Universally sought immortals:
1. Taxpayers are the universal category of sought immortal, hah.  People who truly believe in working to support specific programs are the ones who enable those specific programs to become larger and more uniformly implemented.  Finding taxpayers could be the whole determination of the Eternity's Harvest project and one of the ways that the "True" ideology of the program is proven.
2. Lawyers are another category of sought immortal that is rarely satiated.  The infinitely perfect court system is not attainable, but the effort to attempt it is essential.  In a post-economic society, purifying the courts 'excessively' is an ongoing affair, and the bleeding edge of justice is a grieving heart that never quits.

Participant Kinds:
1.  Independents
	1.  Not a conventional faction, but the unfactionalized individuals who make up the simulation entrant population.  These haven't been sorted, or haven't been trained enough to be productive, or are participating in the simulation despite outstanding complaints against all three factions.
	2. Their faction affiliations are an unset liquid.  "Independent Unioneer", "Independent Planet Builder," and "Independent Hyperconsensual" are possible if and when Independents want to declare them.  So is "Independent Unaligned", which is the default "faction".
2.  Ascendant
	1.  There's no functional difference between an ascendant and an independent, but ascendants have a job with a faction waiting for them outside of the simulations when the current session ends.  They've been identified for the Harvest as a stable immortal.
	2.  All ascendants are "ascendant faction", so there are "Ascendant Unioneer", "Ascendant Planet Builder", and "Ascendant Hyperconsensual".  Ordinarily, Ascendant faction-alignments do not fluctuate.
3.  Governor
	1.  Governors have jobs with the factions, but those jobs are some variant of "operate the simulation from within the simulation".  They play critical roles and/or control NPC elements within the simulation (see Null).
	2.  All governors are "faction governor", reversing the template for Indies and Ascends.  So there are "Unioneer Governor", "Planet Builder Governor", and "Hyperconsensual Governor".
	3.  Not all governors are VIPs.  Some long-term indies who have been through a lot of simulations while consistently loving some collection of minor jobs get graduated to petty governor roles where they are expected to perform those minor jobs consistently.
4.  Null
	1.  Nulls are AI-operated characters in the simulation.  They are generally disposable.  Necessary characters with particularly bad life expectancies (such as people dwelling in active warzones, especially soldiers) are usually nulls.
	2.  Null factions, when relevant, are referred to as "faction null", thus "Unioneer Null", "Planet Builder Null", and "Hyperconsensual Null".  The majority of nulls are "Unaligned Null".
	3.  Nulls with very complex coding are occasionally identified as accidental sapiences and given the option to depart from the simulation to exist outside of it.  If they cling to life within the simulation, they're graduated to Independents.

I'm thinking that the Eternity's Harvest project is a world-of-worlds that runs in a massive post-economic virtual reality where people have signed up in billions to be sorted, elevated, and given an avenue to a broader paradise back out in the real.  At the same time, it's also a planet-building project with a massive megastructure that they extend over time based on talents surfaced in the virtual reality.  The Eternity's Harvest project is run overall by Paradise Overseers who try to fit everyone into a perfect paradise within and without the simulation.

Modelling after The Viceroy, it could be that every 'run' of a simulation in Eternity's Harvest encompasses several simulated star systems and takes 100-300 subjective years, with outliers in the 500+ year range, and these years are used to train and judge the people who signed up to participate.  Some people participate in many of them, and some of them are just using the system to recreationally live various lives.  This is an approved use of the Eternity's Harvest simulation, though the simulators try to draw people back out into the megastructure society outside of the simulations as well, via finding perfect conditions for them.

The three factions love each other and lives as equals outside of the simulations.  Inside of the simulations, they compete to win control of each simulation, presenting as competing ideological groupings that strive to secure the tax income of each simulated society.  When any of the factions successfully secure funding for initiatives, they gain points!  Eventually, each simulated territory gets oversubscribed, overtaxed, overworked, or otherwise unsustainably built up; when the available resources run out, the simulation wraps up neatly and final scores are tabulated.
