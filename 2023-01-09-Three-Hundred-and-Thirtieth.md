I'm fasting again this week.  Sort of fasting.  Four hundred calories or less per day.  That's how I do it.  "Fast-simulating diet".  Extreme caloric restriction, not quite a true fast.

Today, I ate 380 calories of fatty chocolate.  It was very satisfying.  I didn't feel desperately hungry after eating it.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's because I didn't obsess over it.  I just did it.

I'm working on a second draft for my third manuscript.  The first draft is so badly written that I got depressed about trying to finish it.  I estimate that I can trim 15,000 words from the first draft and have a much better story to continue working on.  I've trimmed 1,167 words from it so far tonight.  Only 13,833 words to go!

I've gone through 12,960 words of the story and I've trimmed 1,378 of them.  It's slow going.  I've got 13,622 words to get to my estimate.  If all the story were written like the material I'm currently editing, I don't think I'd get there, but I know I haven't reached the really inflated parts of it.  I'm convinced that many of the chapters across the middle of the book are thousands of words longer than they ought to be.
