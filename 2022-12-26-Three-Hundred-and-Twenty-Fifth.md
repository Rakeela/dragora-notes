More candy!  I'm starting today with marzipan!

1)  Niederegger Milk Chocolate Marzipan.  Chocolate bar filled with marzipan.  200 calories per 1/3rd.  Delicious!
2) Ritter Sport Marzipan.  Chocolate bar filled with marzipan.  160 calories per 1/4th.  Also delicious.  The Niederegger looks better, but I think the Ritter Sport is tastier...  On the other hand, there's a faint aftertaste here that wasn't in the Niederegger.  Maybe I didn't give it time to develop.
3) Lindt Peppermint Cookie Chocolate Truffle.  Small minty chocolate ball.  74 calories.  Still as smooth as I was hoping it would be.

I ate a vegetable roll with shrimp.  I'm going to estimate that at 360 calories.

4) Reben Mozart Piano Bar.  Chocolate bar filled with pistachio-marzipan and hazelnut-praline.  239 calories.  I've been looking forward to this one.  I bet it's the best pistachio-based candy that I've got.  I would've made that bet before tasting it, but I'll double down now that I've tried i.t
5) Another 1/3d of the Niederegger Milk Chocolate Marzipan.  200 calories.  No accompaniment this time.  Let's see how the aftertaste develops...  It seems what lingers here is as delicious as it started.  Excellent.  This IS the better chocolate vs Ritter Sport.

I'm done with my December writing goal, but I've just realized something that I want to add to one of the files.  1,077 words on the file.  1,196 on the file.  119 words of progress.  I'm just going to turn that in immediately.

6) Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Date Royale.  Chocolate-covered peanut butter filled dates.  47 calories each.  The second one was even tastier than the first.
7) Alter Eco Burnt Caramel.  Chocolate bar with small burnt caramel pieces.  170 calories per 4 pieces.  It's good chocolate.  I'm not sure the burnt caramel pieces contribute to it.  They're more of a textural element than a flavor element.  The inside of the container has an interesting picture of a biodiverse cacao plantation, boasting twice as many trees per acre as a monocultural plantation and better protection for soil fertility.
8) Butlers Irish Whiskey Truffle.  Chocolate bar with a soft interior flavored by whiskey.  350 calories.

Dinner is a 310 calorie spinach paneer plate.  A tally of the calories I've eaten so far today looks like 2110 calories.  Not bad for a day of feasting!
