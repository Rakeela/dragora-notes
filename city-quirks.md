# City Quirks

5% of everything is stolen in this city.  It is considered a kind of local entropy; all valuable things are eroded by nicks.  It is also considered a kind of local artwork; thefts are of tiny amounts and concealed adeptly.  That there is a wit to it has been well-proven, as twice the city has carved communal statues from blocks of unusually valuable stone left out in public squares.

It's oddly uncomfortable to add more to this.  Sinter's paradise is the only easy one so far, though certainly I've thought of other city quirks to potentially use in writing.  Are creative difficulties always also emotional difficulties?
