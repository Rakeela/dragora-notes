# City Quirks

5% of everything is stolen in this city.  It is considered a kind of local entropy; all valuable things are eroded by nicks.  It is also considered a kind of local artwork; thefts are of tiny amounts and concealed adeptly.  That there is a wit to it has been well-proven, as twice the city has carved communal statues from blocks of unusually valuable stone left out in public squares.
