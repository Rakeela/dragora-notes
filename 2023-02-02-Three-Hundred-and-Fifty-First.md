249.6 pounds.  That's my fully-dressed, first-thing-in-the-morning weighing for today.  I don't know how I could possibly have lost 1.8 pounds overnight, but it makes up for the 2 days of static weight.  It seems like no news is good news on the diet front.  If my weight isn't going up, it's going down.  It's so hard to make my weight go down.

6 hours, 13 minutes, 53 seconds.  9.2 miles.  Estimated caloric burn: 1,541 kcal.  1.5 mph was the setting I had it on; the summary page claims that was 1.4 mph.  30,446 steps.  My feet hurt.

I want to eat more, but I've already eaten about 655 calories today.  I was supposed to eat 400, so I'm over my target.  I don't get to eat anything else tonight.  The culprit is that I ate a keto meal replacement bar (240 calories) for breakfast, while still having a falafel wrap for lunch.  The falafel wrap alone was 390 calories.  I don't really regret going a little over.  I should still be fine.

I want to be like, "I burned so many calories!  I should eat to replenish myself!"  Unfortunately, I know that humans are not calorimeters.  Calories-in/calories-out is false dogma.  If I were to eat 1,541 calories today, I would gain weight today even though "I burned that much".  To keep lipolysis going, I have to eat very little.
