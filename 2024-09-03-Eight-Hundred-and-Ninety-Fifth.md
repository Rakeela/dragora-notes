10:29.  I slept in.  I wasn't paralyzed or anything this time.  I just couldn't bear to get up.

10:57.  Ugh.  103,201.

12:25.  I've been editing steadily, but I'm taking a break to poke at my TTRPG campaign.

13:05.  I took a few notes on my TTRPG campaign, went for a bio break (I hate biology), and now I think I'm going to load up The Ascent.

15:48.  Oh, I've been working for a while.  I rarely play The Ascent for very long.  103,480.

15:58.  Credit 11,461 words editing.  103,508.  The Ascent had a power-interruption crash earlier.  Frankly, I suspect that someone has hacked the internet quite pervasively to punish people who "waste time" with power interruptions... but I've been pretty productive so far today.  I'm going to take another The Ascent break.

16:33.  In fairness, the game has gotten straight-up unstable.  It's not like it's crashing the same way every time.  I've seen four different crash behaviors the last four times it has crashed, and I think it has now crashed more than any other game I've played on its console.

17:07.  Credit 3,897 words editing.  15,358 edited, tallied.  103,553.

17:24.  Credit 2,688 words editing.  18,046 edited, tallied.  103,617.

17:25.  I wanted to finish editing The Fall of Foyis by the 10th, and I am ahead of schedule on that.  Maybe I should stop and work on something else.  I've got a book to read.  My own book - I need to review it for errors so that I can authorize the print edition.  Once it's printed, corrections are not possible.

17:36.  Ugh.  It took a surprising amount of time to get started, and then I stopped basically instantly.  I didn't want to read Stone and Paintings.

17:46.  I'm going back to editing The Fall of Foyis.  It's what I want to be doing.

18:30.  Credit 3,355 words editing.  21,401 edited, tallied.  103,784.

19:24.  Credit 5,312 words editing.  26,713 edited, tallied.  103,854.

20:07.  I took a break to write up political thoughts and post them online.

20:45.  Curses.  I found a chronology error in The Fall of Foyis.

20:54.  Credit 3,641 words editing.  30,354 edited, tallied.  103,852.

21:03.  Credit 2,392 words editing.  32,746 edited, tallied.  

21:08.  Credit 81 words editing.  32,827 edited, tallied.

21:29.  I've been faffing about since the last time point, I think I meaningfully stopped work then.  I'm going to formalize that and declare a stopping point at Chapter Fifteen.  I'll resume at Chapter Fifteen next time I edit The Fall of Foyis.  Oh, and the writing tally...  103,883.  682 words written.
