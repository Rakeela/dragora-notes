I wish I could come up with a protocol for replacing the mitochondria in a living animal.  This may be something which impaired my ability to think about [[exogenous-mitochondria]].  Adding a few mitochondria is not enough to achieve the full potential of mitochondria modification.  Resculpturing the metabolism of a beneficiary of such a therapy would require extensively replacing their mitochondria population.

I suspect that mitochondrial dysfunction in zero-G is a non-uniform trait, and so I think that mitochondrial replacement may be important for producing fully adapted space-dwellers and vacuum-based lifeforms.  I'd like to find or invent transgenic mitochondria that function better in zero-G.  A total replacement procedure is not necessary for success; in zero-G the better adapted mitochondria would then proliferate and predominate.  Yet a sufficient replacement procedure would be needed to avoid cellular stresses during the transition from one predominant mitochondrial population to another, and I haven't a clue how to start in on the concept of mitochondrial replacements.

I don't think that it's been done in a multicellular lifeform yet.
