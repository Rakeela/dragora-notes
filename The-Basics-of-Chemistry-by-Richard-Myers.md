#The-Basics-of-Chemistry-by-Richard-Myers

I've read chapters 15-19 and I'm considering handing this book back in to the library.  I don't know literally everything in the earlier chapters, but I know most of it...

This book is notable as it was while reading it that I had the idea to wonder about nuclear geometry.  Does the particular arrangement of neutrons and protons within the nucleus of atoms matter?  Are they one shared cloud of potential, without distinct locations, or could the islands of stability contain new entries if only we could control exactly how the neutrons and protons were positioned relative to each other?
