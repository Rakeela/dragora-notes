17:31.  I'm going to make another attempt at quitting sweets.  It seems impossible, but I keep thinking of it as similar to quitting meat.  The thing is, quitting meat didn't work the first few times I tried it.  I want to say that I had 4 false starts.  It could've been more.  That's 4 times I said, "I'm a vegetarian now," when I was only temporarily vegetarian and in fact went back to eating meat.  The fifth time, or however many times it was when I finally held on, I thought, "I'm gonna be 'a vegetarian' for a while, and it's not going to hold like it didn't hold the last several times, but I'm going to do it while it lasts."  I was no longer confident that I could become a vegetarian.  Except I could.  It worked.  I'm deeply settled into vegetarianism now.  If I take that attitude towards sweets, I can have false starts, and someday I'll have the true start where I stop eating sweets.  I'm letting myself eat freely today, and I plan to eat freely in the coming days, but I won't eat sweets.  I'll probably gain a few pounds, but I'll gain them without sweets!  That's my current intention.

19:39.  I accidentally double-clicked on my treadmill, so.  21,036 steps.  1,010 kcal.  5.5 miles.  1.1 mph.  4 hours, 40 minutes, 27 seconds.

20:40.  My self-esteem has been really weak lately.  I've been really down on myself and tending to feel like an utter failure.

23:46.  I tell myself it's just flavor, but tonight I've drank too much caffeine, and I'm awake at 23:46.  Food in the evening didn't help.

23:55.  Food in the morning, when I want to be alert, tends to make me sleepy.  Food in the evening, when I want to be sleepy, tends to make me alert.
