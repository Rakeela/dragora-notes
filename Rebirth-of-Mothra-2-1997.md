I'm partway through watching it, and this movie seems very goofy.  I admit I've been left with a sense of, "I'm never getting this fraction of my life back."

Garu-Garu has gotten less emotive spotlight so far, and I'm disappointed.  I love the little dragon.  Big Bad Dagarla appears to be a dragon too, at least.
