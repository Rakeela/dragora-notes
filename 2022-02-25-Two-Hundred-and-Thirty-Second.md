I had a dream that was fun about a game that doesn't exist, though it isn't quite tasteful enough to go into the [[Videogame-Wishlist]].

"Video games that never existed" are a dream genre to me.  This one was a dream about a game where a great corrupting force spread itself first through manifesting sexualized anthros in a fantasy world.  The first manifestations of the corrupting force were mostly clean and tempting.  The sense of that word 'clean' should become apparent when I say that the later manifestations of the corrupting force were filthy, vile demons of nightmarish appearance who could barely be sexualized at all due to their sheer ugliness.

There were "two" factions in the game that the player could join:
1) The "chaos" faction who were demon cults concealing the uglliness of the corrupting force while bringing in people with the most appealing manifestations of it.
2) A golden inquisitor faction who were brutally violent towards every single anthro in the land, whether they were strictly associated with the demon cults or not.

I say "two" for a reason I'll get back to.

Across the course of the game, the injustice in both approaches became more prevalent.  The injustice in the chaos faction became more prevalent because they became increasingly openly just violent demons as the corrupting force manifested more strongly.  It was essentially a demon god trying to create a new layer of hell out of the setting.  The injustice in the inquisitor faction became more prevalent because an increasing swathe of the NPCs in the game got transformed in one way or another by the machinations of the chaos faction, who engineered far more transformations than they got recruits.  It was eventually untenable to pretend that every anthro in the land was a demon cultist.

I went with the chaos faction and found a third option to limit the injustice in the storyline.  After smashing the inquisitors and claiming one of their headquarters as a demon cult base, there was the possibility of reaching out to their golden god, whose name was given as "Marek".  Marek, as it turns out, was *not intrinsically against anthros*, nor even against transformations as such, as long as the transformees were stable in mind and intending to fit into a peaceful society.  So it was possible to become a disciple of Marek after being transformed by the chaos faction, and then to begin blessing and stabilizing demon cultists to start creating a base that would defend both humans *and* anthros against *both* the demon cult *and* the inquisitors.

Being Marek's furry was like a third faction option.  This is why I put "two" in quotes earlier.  Marek didn't seem to hold a grudge against me for leading demons into killing a base full of inquisitors.  Perhaps they'd grown corrupted as well.  The demons I'd lead also didn't seem to immediately reject me for becoming Marek's disciple.  They seemed to be surprised, awed, and impressed by my status as 'the pretty one'... they'd gotten a little dumb after going through too many corrupting transformations.

There may have been some storyline option with the inquisitors as well that would limit the injustice in the storyline, but I didn't play for the inquisitors, so I didn't discover it.

Incidental notes:
1) The demon cultists couldn't control exactly what someone would transform into.  The corrupting force did that.  At first, transformations were appealing and attractive.  Later transformations, *especially* voluntary retransformations of the already-transformed, got steadily uglier.
2) A lot of people transformed into talking objects.  This provided decor for the cultist bases, and some of the cultists had magical weapons and shields that bemoaned their "imprisonment" into intelligent objects.
3) As a "chaos" cultist, I was given a standard issue spray bottle of corruption.  Yes, spray bottle.  It was a transparent bottle full of blue liquid that refilled itself when I wasn't spraying it.  Spraying anyone enough with it would induce a sudden transformation.  This was fine for a dream, but too silly for the grotesque transformations in the "game".  I would implement it differently in a game.
4) At one point in the "game", I sprayed someone with the spray bottle, and they turned into a transparent modern rectangular riot shield.  I then made use of them against their enemies in battle!
5) After becoming Marek's golden disciple, I still had the transforming spray bottle, only now it was full of golden liquid that refilled when I wasn't spraying it.  It no longer transformed people into objects and it no longer made retransformations uglier.  It instead now transformed its targets into various colors of humans and anthros.
6) There was also a tertiary faction of finny dragon anthros in the setting.  They were immune to transformation, but could be convinced to join either the inquisitors or the demon cultists.  I recruited them, obviously.
7) Instead of calling the demon faction "chaos" as it was called in the dream, they should be given a different name if it were ever really implemented in a game.
