Part B
1.  I live next to a trail.
2.  The trail I live next to is bikable and smoothly paved.
3.  All of them.  All of them everywhere.  I have a magical teleporting bike.  Sorry, no; I mean I can bike twenty miles fairly comfortably and the local trails/parks interconnect, so I don't need a car to get to neighboring communities and their parks, too.  It takes all day, but I've even biked to and from Seattle.
4.  Approximately everywhere in Redmond is treeful.
5.  Trees are beautiful, and they sound good, too.  The sound of wind in a leafy canopy is uniquely beautiful.
