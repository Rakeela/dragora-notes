I think I liked the book better, but I don't remember either very well at this point.  Maybe I should watch this one again.

I finally got to rewatch it.  What a great movie!  I really had forgotten it.  Not entirely.  Just enough to be surprised again.  Am I grateful to lose memory?  It was special the second time, too.
