One of the things I estimate about people is "linguistic chaos".  Everyone has some.  My own self-estimated inguistic chaos is not the lowest possible.  It's not something I estimate with numbers; it's an intuitive estimate.  Extreme linguistic chaos is easy to describe: word salad.  Most people express moderate linguistic chaos, which is harder to define, though grammar and spelling are the most obvious part of it.  Lower is usually better, though as with many kinds of mental chaos it can be potentially useful for creativity.

I pay attention to linguistic chaos, because it's one of my basic factors in my holistic estimates of how someone's mind works.  It's also (arguably inappropriately) something that I tend to think of when estimating conceptual chaos: the degree to which someone is mangling abstract sequences in their thoughts.  Conceptual chaos is what I really care about in this respect, but linguistic chaos is what I can actually observe.

This is one for my [[environmental-news-archive]].  I wish I could push this more effectively, too.  It's a good basic idea for increasing the efficiency of land use.

The claims about "the costs of renewables are always falling" are kind of interesting.  If there's a huge amount of resources flowing to something, my expectation is that it would get *pricier*.  In order to make renewable costs fall constantly while uptake also rises, that seems like it would take careful planning.  That seems like a managed market narrative, which in turn seems like it might be a barrier to achieving full utilization.

I hope solar panel production technologies are sustainable.  I know the batteries aren't; hopefully they can be made sustainable as well.  We'll want to capture as much of the solar light incidence as possible.  Infalling photons are about as 'free' as energy gets... at least until we have ZPE generators.

Speaking of which, people expect ZPE generators would be awesome power sources, but my intuition is that they'll be terrible power sources.  Absolutely terrible, a pure last-resort power source.  Why?  Zero point energy is infinite, but it's not abundant.  It's the tiniest trickle of infinity.  I expect it would take large amounts of metal to produce ZPE arrays that produce modest amounts of power, and they'll only be effective where outside perturbations can be minimized.  So, I expect they'll be useful for deep space, but not so much in the vicinity of stars and planets.

Maybe deep space ZPE arrays are a mod that should be made for Stellaris.  It'd be a way to sink ~500 alloys per array and get a small amount of permanent energy production.

I expect deep space ZPE arrays will someday be important to civilization.  If you combine very profound patience with an infinite energy source, you can not only power systems arbitrarily far away from everything else, you can also accumulate power sufficient for elemental synthesis.  The catch is, who has that kind of supernal patience?  The people capable of inventing such a thing may have no overlap with people who have a psychology capable of utilizing it.
