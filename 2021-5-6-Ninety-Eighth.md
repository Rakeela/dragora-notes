One of the things I estimate about people is "linguistic chaos".  Everyone has some.  My own self-estimated inguistic chaos is not the lowest possible.  It's not something I estimate with numbers; it's an intuitive estimate.  Extreme linguistic chaos is easy to describe: word salad.  Most people express moderate linguistic chaos, which is harder to define, though grammar and spelling are the most obvious part of it.  Lower is usually better, though as with many kinds of mental chaos it can be potentially useful for creativity.

I pay attention to linguistic chaos, because it's one of my basic factors in my holistic estimates of how someone's mind works.  It's also (arguably inappropriately) something that I tend to think of when estimating conceptual chaos: the degree to which someone is mangling abstract sequences in their thoughts.  Conceptual chaos is what I really care about in this respect, but linguistic chaos is what I can actually observe.
