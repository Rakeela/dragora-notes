#2021-11-5-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Third

I took a way early morning weight and I failed to record it here, but...  I don't think I should diet like this.  My four hundred calorie fast-simulating diets leave me thirsty constantly and yet dehydrated.  My body can't integrate water that way.

So I'm not going to keep doing it.  I'll keep food logging while raising my diet to a more reasonable threshold.  I just had a third of a protein muffin (~90 calories) and I'm going to try to eat 1,200 calories today.  That protein muffin wasn't enough of a breakfast for this, so I'm eating some grapenuts instead now (~200 calories for half a cup) plus milk (~51 calories for 80 milliliters).  That's ~341 calories for breakfast, which is more what I should have.

Lunch is likely to be pizza, and I'll skip dinner.  That should make the tally work.  Tomorrow I'll still have a feast day, but I think next week I may eat like this all week.

I was distractingly hungry, so I've just added a "chewy Halloween mini" to the tally.  That's ~60 calories, for a cumulative ~401 calories.
