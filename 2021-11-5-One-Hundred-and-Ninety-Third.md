#2021-11-5-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Third

I took a way early morning weight and I failed to record it here, but...  I don't think I should diet like this.  My four hundred calorie fast-simulating diets leave me thirsty constantly and yet dehydrated.  My body can't integrate water that way.

So I'm not going to keep doing it.  I'll keep food logging while raising my diet to a more reasonable threshold.  I just had a third of a protein muffin (~90 calories) and I'm going to try to eat 1,200 calories today.  That protein muffin wasn't enough of a breakfast for this, so I'm eating some grapenuts instead now (~200 calories for half a cup) plus milk (~51 calories for 80 milliliters).  That's ~341 calories for breakfast, which is more what I should have.

Lunch is likely to be pizza, and I'll skip dinner.  That should make the tally work.  Tomorrow I'll still have a feast day, but I think next week I may eat like this all week.

I was distractingly hungry, so I've just added a "chewy Halloween mini" to the tally.  That's ~60 calories, for a cumulative ~401 calories.

---
Lunch: Half a pesto pizza from the grocery store: ~690 calories.  Running tally:  ~1091 calories.

I plan to skip dinner, but I may finish the ~1200 target by eating a sweet around 4 PM.

Correction, I ate only three pieces of that pizza.  The fourth is in the fridge and will make a nice snack tomorrow or the day after.  So that was ~518 calories, with running tally: ~919 calories.

It would go a little over-budget, but I think my mental health would be well-served by biking across town to buy a peanut butter snack bar.

I'm considering going to a pattern where I "score" ~1000 calories per day, but let myself eat unmetered veggies, plus brazil nuts, excluding corn.

I don't dislike corn at all.  I quite like it!  The problem is that corn is the candy vegetable.  I do like it, but it's not healthy.
