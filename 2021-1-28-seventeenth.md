I avoid dividing physical quantities if I can.  Halves, thirds, quarters, sixths, eighths of cut objects and collections.  I try not to be the one who splits up such things.  I can do it in necessity, but the task makes me very anxious.  If I do that task, I spend the task expecting intrusively that any division I make will be much, much more wrong than I perceive it to be.  When I'm dividing physical objects and collections, I distrust my perceptions.  I'm more comfortable taking a shaved or biased fraction from someone else who does the task poorly than I am with doing the task poorly myself.  The fact of error is not the part that bothers me, but the (exaggeratedly perceived) risk of my own error which strikes that task.

It's just a quirk, though I wonder about it as a cognitive phenomenon.  My perceptions are subjectively unchanged when I am dividing physical quantities, yet I trust them less in that context and more outside of it.  I am no longer as grotesquely unskilled at splitting portions as I once was, such that I could *not* reasonably perform this task, which was the original source of the uncertainty.  Yet from being grotesquely unskilled at a task which is a normal petty competency, to being presently only slightly less skilled than average at a petty task where there is no further reward for skill greater than I have achieved, the phenomenological experience changed *only* in the apparent increase in self-trust.  I initially trusted my perceptions of divided physical quantities, but I discovered that those perceptions were in error.  After that, I greatly distrusted my perceptions of divided physical quantities, but further gains in skill have only been accompanied by an increasing sense of trusting my perceptions of divided physical quantities.  Nothing about my phenomenological experience of proportions changed, yet I can now do this better than I could before.  This implies that I've consciously identified a specific chunk of non-conscious neural processing at the point where my brain is translating visual proportion inputs into abstract proportion estimates - and that I've observed that processing chunk gaining in task conformance despite my lack of success at adding it to my conscious awareness.

I'm glad that population growth rates are still down in many nations.  I know that's going to be a challenge in coming years, but it'll be worth the stress when rejuvenation technologies don't result in a perpetual crush of human bodies and the collapse of the economic strength needed to sustain immortality.
