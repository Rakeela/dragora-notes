I just thought of a plant science experiment that would be neat.  Imagine two aeroponic greenhouses which are designed to be as equivalent as possible, save that one of them has an air-stirring system built into it and designed to create a regular simulated breeze.

Would the two greenhouses perform identically?

Put differently, do plants benefit from wind?

I was thinking about one of the missions in the game Control, which tasks the player to talk to the plants in the Research section.  I haven't done it yet; I've no idea if the game has some wild surprise in store once I do.  I kind of expect that it doesn't.  The mission-giver is one of the more seemingly benevolent characters in the game (he's just the janitor) and one of the better candidates for giving a silly, harmless mission.

I said I was thinking about it, and I wondered specifically: do plant cells grow and divide more effectively when stimulated by vibrations?  I wouldn't expect talking to them to help, but I wouldn't be surprised if they grew better when exposed to simulated breezes.

This kind of thing could be helpful for optimizing agricultural productivity on marginal worlds that humanity settles in the future, most notably Mars and the asteroid belt.  I continue to see the asteroid belt as a *much* more plausible colonization candidate than Venus.
