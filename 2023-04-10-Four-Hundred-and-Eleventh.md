Another rest day.  I may get as much as three hours of walking done today, but I'm not committing to any kind of exercise goal.

I feel like I can't get the right side of my hair to rest comfortably over my ear.  There's this nagging sensation that it isn't right.  Brushing it with my hands wasn't helping at all.  Brushing it with an actual brush revealed some knotting in the proximity, but sorting that out didn't help either.  It still feels wrong.  I wish I didn't have any hair at all.  Dragons shouldn't have hair.

I've been reading a textbook on Nonverbal Communications.  It's boring, depressing, and too focused on physical attractiveness.  The introduction talked about how the book is concerned with signals delivered intentionally rather than merely given off without control, so I feel like the third chapter's focus on evolutionary psychology and the fourth chapter's focus on physical attractiveness are both betraying the promise/summary set forth by the introduction.  I'm thinking this one's rating on Goodreads will be three stars when I finish it.

Growing up, I had constantly bloodshot eyes.  People noticed sometimes, but nobody had any idea what was going on.  Eventually, people started thinking I was a cannabis user who was just relatively well put together.  When I moved out and lived with Kistaro for a while, I still had constantly bloodshot eyes.  For a while, I actually did use cannabis, and that gave me bloodshot eyes, too.  Then my eyes started healing.  Now I don't have bloodshot eyes anymore.

My eyes used to sting all the time.  I never complained.  It was just part of the background hum of what life was like.  I didn't think about it.  I wasn't annoyed by it.  I felt 100% okay with stinging eyes.  I only noticed the stinging eyes when my eyes started healing and were no longer constantly bloodshot.  The loss of the stinging made it noticeable in hindsight.  It wasn't like I hadn't noticed the stinging of my eyes.  I had just never cared.

Now my eyes sting and get bloodshot if I eat too much sugar, but they get better again if I abstain from sugar, relatively speaking.  I don't have to abstain that hard for my eyes to heal.  In hindsight it's like, "Oh.  I was suffering eye damage due to sugar."  I'm not diabetic or anything.  Sugar just seems bad for my eyes.

I can sense when I've eaten too much sugar because of how it makes my eyes feel.  I'm trying to adapt and teach myself to hate this stinging sensation.  I'm struggling because it's still so normal to me.  I grew up with this.  Candy binges bring it back.  If I absolutely hated having my eyes sting, I'd hate candy binging.

I binged on Easter candy that'd dropped on sale.  It wasn't that big as candy binges go.  Four Cadbury eggs, a package of Peeps, and a carton of chocolate covered marshmallows.  The chocolate covered marshmallows were a new brand that I'd never tried before.  They were really the highlight, even though they weren't that good for what they were, because even a trace of novelty makes candies spectacular to me.  Now my eyes sting again.

Nobody in my life has ever proposed that sugar could be making my eyes bloodshot.  This is my own suspicion.

Trying to make myself hate stinging eyes didn't work.  I went out to a different store and bought more Easter surplus.  I ate a bit more candy.

I didn't really like it.  I almost threw out a huge marshmallow-flavored Easter rabbit candy for dissatisfying me.  I felt desperate for the crunch and spice of seasoned fresh vegetables.  So I went out to the store again and I bought a vegetarian wrap.  It was heavenly.  It was so much what I wanted.

I live to eat.

I've been hiding something under all my words today.  There's a truism I think of with myself...  I don't know how to phrase it exactly.  It's a feeling, not a phrase.  "Wordiness means misery."  When I have a lot to write, I'm usually unhappy, even if I'm not talking about being unhappy.  Appallingly, I think this applies to my stories as well; writing doesn't make me happy so much as it makes unhappiness feel like it's accomplishing something.

See, my attempt to add another variable to my kobold simulator failed.  I produced a very dissatisfying equation that doesn't behave the way I want.  Bhijn suggested appending another equation to it so that the calculation evaluates one way at low numbers and another way at high numbers.  That's very tempting.  It may be the fix I need.  Still, my first attempt failed, and that weighs on me badly.

I have to add more variables.  Lots more variables.  The variables guide the simulation.  They need to interact with each other.  Most of them need to present something to the player.

I can't do it.  I'm immobilized by misery.

So, Stellaris.  I'll play a game for a while.  And tomorrow I'll be walking all day long.  Maybe I'll try adding a new variable tomorrow.

Hm.  That is two lost Stellaris games in a row.  The first time, I started out with the "crashed slave society" origin.  I wasn't able to advance technologically fast enough to keep up, and was outpaced by other empires.  The second time, I started with the shattered ring world start.  It has changed from what it was, and seems to have been weakened; it is not as much of a drastic advantage as it used to be.  The second game, I kept up technologically, but did not excel.  I was outmatched by a purifier empire that started in my vicinity.  They brought two fleets to my empire each of which matched my entire collective military.

I also discovered that I was not able to keep my population as happy as I am used to keeping them.  My stability was lower than it was in past games.  Balance patches may have eroded my preferred strategies... or I may have forgotten something that worked.

This was my first game where I played Xenophile+Subterfuge.  The First Contact patch makes Xenophile interesting again as an ethic.  The additional envoys that xenophiles get give them an advantage in espionage.  Unfortunately, espionage sucks down influence for marginal advantage in this game, so it doesn't really pay off.

Ah.  I turned off difficulty scaling.  The AI was jumping in with 'moderate bonuses'.  Those early bonuses weigh in a lot on its capabilities later on.  I'm turning difficulty scaling back on, setting it to 'mid-game start year'.  Even that system doesn't work the way I remember.  I thought difficulty scaling was just on or off.
