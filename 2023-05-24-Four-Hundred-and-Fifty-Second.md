8:13.  I ate another five Peeps, whereupon I made a discovery about Peeps.  They're made with gelatin!  They're not vegetarian.

8:22.  I meant to add this to the note nine minutes ago.  I plan to keep the Peeps, but never buy any ever again.  That's how I've handled gelatin reveals in the past.

8:24.  I may talk to Kistaro about it.  Last time there was a gelatin reveal in something I'd been eating, it was reasonably healthy.  Peeps aren't healthy.  I'd only be clinging to the experience.

9:08.  I laid on the couch for a while, feeling overwhelmed by memories of past mistakes.

9:15.  I feel remarkably little inclination to record thoughts of past mistakes.

9:22.  I want to devour more sweets, but I already feel like i overate with a cookie and five Peeps.

9:32.  It's much easier to not ruminate on past mistakes while engaging with the world rather than laying on the couch.  Wow though, I'm still tired.

9:43.  I laid briefly back in bed.  On the ruminometer, the bed does almost as well as being engaged with my computer.

11:27.  With all the laying down and such, it's been hard to get going this morning.  I even made a trip to the grocery store to buy more cookies, since I exhausted my supply of "Decadent Red Velvet Chocolate Chunk".  Now I have 5x "Private Selection Ultimate Chocolate Chunk".  They were on discount in the clearance rack.  

11:30.  I am scatterbrained this morning.  My state of mind is annoying me.  I had trouble waking up in a timely manner, and now three and a half hours later I still have not gotten anything done.

11:44.  I have a book on mining in the neolithic and bronze age.  It is hard to read quickly.  The diagrams are fascinating.  The book doesn't describe its insights, so it yields them only slowly to study.

11:45.  I have a deeply frustrating desire for chocolate, and I have had it for hours.  Noooo!  I had chocolate for breakfast!  I am going to eat some cheese.
