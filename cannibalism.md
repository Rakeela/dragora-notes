# Cannibalism

A trauma node.

I believe I know what human flesh tastes like.  Someday everyone will... thanks to [[vat meat]], which is not cannibalism at all.

I define cannibalism as the hunting and consumption of sapient beings.  Cannibalism is the sin of treating sapience as something which can be rightly destined for consumption.

Vat meat was never sapient, so it can't be cannibalized.
