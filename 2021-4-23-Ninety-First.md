Imperial, Commonwealth, Panarchy.  If my life were one of the Viceroy's subcultural progression tracks, it'd be the track of the Panarchic Informalists, who I consider the Panarchic AI Collectives.

My father was a pro-tech laborer.  He worked in telecoms.  He was smarter than he was credited for at any point in his life, but he did not *want* to be credited for his intelligence.  He didn't express that drive, and he didn't express the rejection of that drive.  He valued getting the work done and protecting other people.  I would place him among the Imperials, expressing such a dangerous trust in technology that it made him exploitable.

His expressed ideal-ology, if I can be forgiven a sin of neo-etymology, was the Commonwealth.  Life should be about sex (natalism)!  It should be fun (leisure subsidies)!  People should be lawful and the economy well-regulated (enlightened policing)!  There's a place in society for everyone!  People in every country should love their country, and faithful patriots shouldn't war with each other; governments should be *meta-nationalist*!

That last one is stunning, because my father is the only person I've ever met who expressed it, and he did so many years before I encounted The Viceroy.  Meta-nationalism is the Commonwealth Consensus' concept of nationalism, where nationalism strengthens culture while galactic engagement negates nationalistic insularity.
