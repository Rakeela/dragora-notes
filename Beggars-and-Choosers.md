#Beggars-and-Choosers

This book's gene therapy model pissed me off!  It presents a world of superproductive gene-modded people slaving away compassionately to support a second class citizenry of ignorant unmodded people.  It wouldn't be done that way!  If people wanted to be compassionate, they'd make the gene mods available to everyone, and in the process there'd be no great class divide arising.

This author was probably trying to create another, more welfare-friendly variant of the "rich people get gene mods" vision, depicting a society that develops gene mod inequality while having strong welfare provision.  Yet the whole "rich people get gene mods" story has the problem that the people with bad genes are *poor*.  Plus, gene therapies are rolled out to consenting adults, and author after author gets that wrong!
