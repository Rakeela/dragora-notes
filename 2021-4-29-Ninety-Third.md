I wish I could do more for research.  I need more credentials in order to be taken seriously, and... well, it's demoralizing interacting with What Is Known, being able to contribute nothing to it.  Schoolwork is not demoralizing in the same way.

Should I just... try to embrace a repetitious scholasticism?  I might be able to do that.  I could review my links and notes, like rereading a well-loved book.

Is it strange that I've always had difficulty reviewing tasks?

I finished my first Stellaris campaign today.

For the first time ever, I saw the victory screen... but in the end, I lost to a Fallen Empire.  Kistaro says that getting second place as a megacorp is impressive; I doubt it.  Still, it was fun.  I took over about a fifth of the galaxy as the Irenic Ubaric Syndicate, a xeno-friendly trade league of egalitarian pacifists specializing in genetic engineering services.

Raptors.  Friendly utopian raptors.  Who started on a damaged ringworld.

We were catching up on the Fallen Empire, but I didn't come up with any way to delay it from finishing the crisis.  So it won!

The map had started out packed with militarists and xenophobes.  Towards the end of the game, that had all been cleared out.  Survivor civs were either my vassals, the vassals of the fallen empire, or the xenophilic fallen empire that never "went active" at all, but just kept quietly tending its zoo throughout the entire campaign.

The second largest empire in the game was a rival of mine, a necrophage fungal AI which was also pacifist, xenophile, and egalitarian...  I'd been building up to try to take them down when the crisis spawned and nearly eliminated them for me.

I've wanted to complete a Stellaris game since I first loaded one, but it takes a fairly powerful computer to get through the endgame in reasonable time.  I have plenty of ideas for how I could do better in a future play-through, and plenty of ideas for civilizations to play.  That said, I'm not sure when or if I'll do that.  It's a vast time-sink.  How many narratives can I extract from it, and of what quality?  Wouldn't I rather read a book?

I also get the feeling that there's something...  unpleasant about the game.  Hostile.  If nothing else, there are traces of dread in the lore.  I can't tell if that's artful or best avoided.  I feel like the game is an example of anti-hedonic investment; designed in some ways to be subpar and insulting, full of issues that won't be fixed this decade...  At the same time, I acknowledge that it has already survived longer than I would expect an anti-hedonic product to survive, and it's still being polished.  Perhaps what won't be fixed this decade will be fixed next decade.  A strange thought.

I mentioned books.  I feel like I "should" be trying to conquer my book collection.

Like, conquering.  Consuming the books in my spare hours to fill out my [[Bibliography]].  The only books you truly own are the ones that you have read, after all.

I can post a little bit of a world-glimpse like this if I finish a Stellaris game, but I think I get more fodder for cognitive production by completing a book.  As well, it's easier to sort my book-related thoughts into the bibliography, which also provides a structure for taking notes should I choose to.

As recreational achievements go, a sentence of thought about a book is worth more than many videogame achievements, and to go beyond that is worth more than all but the most impressive of the things that can be accomplished in a game.
