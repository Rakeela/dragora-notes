I wish I could do more for research.  I need more credentials in order to be taken seriously, and... well, it's demoralizing interacting with What Is Known, being able to contribute nothing to it.  Schoolwork is not demoralizing in the same way.

Should I just... try to embrace a repetitious scholasticism?  I might be able to do that.  I could review my links and notes, like rereading a well-loved book.

Is it strange that I've always had difficulty reviewing tasks?
