10:49.  Last night was so scary, I posted about it on social media.

16:02.  I'm still shaken by last night, but I've had a fun day despite it.  Starting at 12:00 and continuing until 14:12, I had a TTRPG session in a homebrew Golden Treasure game with someone who I don't know well enough yet to call a friend, but who I think will be a friend eventually.  It was a ton of fun.  I haven't done any writing today; I'm thinking of getting to it imminently.

16:03.  57,895.

16:25.  Stepping away from my computer.

17:17.  Back to work.

18:40.  I got absorbed in a porn game for a while.  I feel substantially reset.  That game trances me out.

22:22.  59,250.  1,357 words of progress.
