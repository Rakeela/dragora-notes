11:30.  I'm beta-reading for my favorite author!  Eee, I get to see their next book soon.

12:11.  I'm going to calculate how long my next bottle of liquor should last.  750 ml is 25.3 ounces.  My shot glasses serve two ounces (they're made for espresso).  I drink one such shot per day, and abstain two days per week.  That's a weekly consumption of ten ounces.  Hm.  This bottle will only last 12 days, or two and third weeks.  How dramatically more expensive.  I need to stick to cheap stuff for efficiency's sake...

13:14.  I am agitated and disappointed and powerfully caffeine-craving.  Like wow.  I have enough energy, why do I want caffeine *so badly* right now?

14:00.  68,832.  Wait, whoops.  I forgot to mark my starting point again.  68,607.

14:42.  69,701.  1,094 words of progress.

16:10.  70,436.  2,441 words on the chapter.  

16:51.  71,024.  3,026 words on the chapter.  2,417 words of progress.

19:26.  71,356.  0 words on the chapter.  2,749 words of progress.  I'm craving caffeine again.

19:27.  I've been meditating on patience lately.  A different way of destroying 'Edge'.  The slow stillness.  The willingness to keep moving in the cold.  Steadiness.

19:39.  71,514.  2,907 words of progress.  I don't know what I'm doing next.

19:41.  71,509.  2,902 words of progress.  I trimmed something.  Trimming in-line costs me progress.  This isn't an ideal tracking tool.  Oh well!  It's good enough.
