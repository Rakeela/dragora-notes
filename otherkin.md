# Otherkin

Otherkin believe they have the spirit of something other than a human.

I personally don't consider this a violation of atheism; I was an [[atheist]] in both of two lifetimes as a [[dragon]], too.  I don't believe in [[reincarnation]], but indications are that reincarnation might believe in me.
