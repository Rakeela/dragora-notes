# Otherkin

Otherkin believe they have the spirit of something other than a human.

I personally don't consider being an otherkin to be a violation of atheism; I was an [[atheist]] in both of two lifetimes as a [[dragon]], too.  I don't believe in [[reincarnation]], but indications are that reincarnation might believe in me.

The dragon body was *only* a body, but it was a vastly better one that I never gave up willingly.
