5:59.  I'm up.  I dreamed of playing a game with Kistaro about exploring planets hoping to find life, and there was something about being a dark matter entity collaborating with human researchers, including one "mysterious Ms. Scoakes".  

8:15 already?  Hardly feels like 2:16 since I got up.  I'd better get to work.  54,582 words on the file.  1,505 words on the chapter.

9:11.  55,083.  2,006 words on the chapter.

9:58.  55,481.  2,404 words on the chapter.

10:28.  55,864.  2,787 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.

10:53.  I've been consumed by reading and editing one of my earlier manuscripts since the last time-point, so I haven't written a word on Kura and Kaire since then.

12:07.  56,874.  1,007 words on the chapter.  2,292 words of progress.

12:47.  I took a break.  Was that 40 minutes?  It flew right by.  Ugh.  I don't know what to write next on the story.  I never get writer's block for long anymore, but I'm not exactly a stranger on it.

12:49.  What do I need to establish in this chapter?  The *next* Kaire chapter will be a big deal, but *this* Kaire chapter is kinda just...  I guess... a last chance to have a party dynamic before things get shaken up.

13:19.  57,441.  1,574 words on the chapter.

13:51.  57,729.  1,862 words on the chapter.  Added a video-game-ism.

14:18.  58,071.  2,202 words on the chapter.

14:32.  58,259.  2,390 words on the chapter.

15:30.  59,161.  3,290 words on the chapter.  Cripes.  I don't want to trim this.

15:45.  59,028.  3,157 words on the chapter.  Cripes, I don't want to trim this *more*.

15:58.  59,051.  3,180.  Cripes, I tried to trim more and ended up making it worse.  Maybe I can call this good enough and just move on?

15:59.  59,053.  New chapter.  4,471 words of progress.

19:22.  I've wasted hours arguing online.  Doesn't really feel like wasted time, emotionally.  Just kinda stressful.  I don't get into it with specific people.
