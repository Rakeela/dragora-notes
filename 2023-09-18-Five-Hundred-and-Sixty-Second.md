14:53.  I'm updating my candy vault with a removed note for the Tony's Chocolonely Dark Chocolate.  It's only half-eaten, and I didn't eat any of it today, but I should've marked it as removed when I opened it.  I'm following a new policy of marking belated removals when I discover that I should've removed them, instead of deleting entries that were handled improperly.

16:46.  I can't do anything but rot.  I am just dying slowly.

16:48.  I am worthless.  All I want to do is play Starfield.  And I'm going to go do it.  I'm going to play more Starfield today.  I'm not going to write.  My plans are failing.  My ideas are worthless.

19:24.  I'm behind on my reading.  Extended focus on Starfield makes me feel worse...  sorta.  It would feel better if I were working on sci-fi stories with an exploration focus.  It's not a useful headspace for my current writing, so it feels *terrible*.  However.  Reading feels good.  I may spend a day catching up on reading.  Extended focus on reading is useful.

19:29.  I'm still reading Out in All Directions.  I want to rate it highly as an awesome cultural resource, and I want to rate it poorly as an awesome time sink that took forever to read.  I'm probably going to give it four stars on GoodReads.

19:51.  Out in All Directions has given me the idea of maybe advertising to the queer community.  I've been thinking about advertising today.  I set myself the task of advertising, in fact.  Of studying advertising.  Contemplating advertising.  I've done a little bit of it.  I haven't been especially inspired.  I've felt pretty awful.  But I've done a little bit of it, and I think the biggest barrier my work faces is the neopronouns.  Maybe I could get a weirder, more hip audience with my work, and attract attention to it that way.
