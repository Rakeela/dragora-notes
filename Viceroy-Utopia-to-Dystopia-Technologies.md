#Viceroy-Utopia-to-Dystopia-Technologies

I see something of an implied hidden ranking in the virtue of the different technologies.

Firstly, each technology strikes me as a "pole of protection" for a different kind of person.  Each pole extends for some distance around it on the graph, and each pole extends farther "down" than "up".  Some of them are very, very wide; Planned Urbanization protects a LOT of kinds of people, not just those who are adjacent to it.  Some of them are fairly narrow; "Panarchic War Memorials" are a specialist application that shields a fairly narrow class of talent.  Since the protection shadow that I visualize from each technology extends farther down than up, the technologies at the top-center of the graph (Holistic Industrialization and Artificial Dreamtime) are notable for reaching farthest upwards in what they protect and therefore also having large rainshadows under them.

Secondly, each technology strikes me as having an implied position on a notional bureaucracy-to-disaster scale.  Bureaucratic technologies add literally to bureaucratic waste.  They can be corrupt, inappropriate, or incompetent, but they are *not* dystopic; they fail pathetically rather than catastrophically.  Disastrous technologies add metaphorically to bureaucratic waste; they waste bureaucrats, or at least prevent them from arising in society.  Either way, the territories in The Viceroy get steadily more unfit for bureaucratic life, and hating bureaucrats only ultimately makes territories more ungovernable; society needs *skilled* and *productive* bureaucracies, not *no* bureaucracies!  Humanity hates the wrong thing when it hates bureaucrats.

I was thinking that I could assemble a list of technologies by their order of virtue in these senses: how many people their pole of protection covers, and where they are on the bureaucracy-to-disaster scale.  The result wouldn't necessarily be an optimal order of implementation in the game; the mechanical effects of the technologies would be disregarded for this purpose.

Purely bureaucratics:
These defy the sorting method used for the rest of the rankings, so I'll list separately the technologies whose downsides I consider purely bureaucratic.  I estimate these technologies as becoming pathetic rather than dystopic in the event that their host territory collapses.  This list is not 'ordered', and it may also be incomplete.
 * Holistic Industrialization
 * Common Suffrage
 * Panarchic Retreat
 * Planned Urbanization
 * Panarchic Symposium
 * Industrial Overseer
 * Distributed Desalination
 * Stasis Controller
 * Seat of Policy
(Yes, I estimate the Industrial Overseer AI as also being non-dystopic.  It's a specialist multiplier lacking intrinsic activation, and unlike the Lord Industrial on the other side of the graph it isn't described as taking control from anyone in particular; if it starts making things worse, people will surely just stop working with it...)
