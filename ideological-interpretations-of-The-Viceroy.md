# Ideological Interpretations of The Viceroy

Presented in the game's lore are the six subcultural ideologies, the three overarching ideologies, and the implicit subdivisions in the technology graph.  Thoughts on the social dynamics implied by the choices and the collections of the choices seem like one of the core aspects going on in the narratives that are told within the game by the game's mechanics.

---
The Six Subcultures
 - The Old Empire -
	 - The Basic
		 - The humans most like Beyonders summoned the Beyonders most like humans, creating the Empire of the Elect.  This fraction of the Old Empire is serene because they know that the time cost of each action is illusory.  They're happy to jaunt around *being* the fungible population, doing esoteric tasks for the amusement of distant strangers on other worlds, trusting that enough will get done fast enough if people just keep working without worrying about it.
	 - The Value of Immortality
		 - Velocity is only a matter of perspective; slow and steady work may even get the work done faster.  Immortality does these people a great service.
	 - The View on Collapse
		 - The Old Empire holds the burning world in its hands.  That's an important symbol for them.  Yes, galactic society is always collapsing, and yes that means the empire is always collapsing.  The old empire is aware that they are infinitely declining forever.  They call that acknowledging entropy, and they only worry about it day to day to the extent that doing so is part of their dayjob.
	 - The Stereotype
		 - Placid, but occasionally surprising.
	 - The Rebellion (Commonwealth)

 - The Reformed Empire -
		 - The Basic
			 - Serenity in motion, and an occasionally vile sense of humor.  An active opposition to anything that doesn't seem like a productive endeavor, combined with a will to prey on labor opportunities, off-load their challenges, exaggerate their accomplishments, and look for opportunities to coast.  Are they productive on average?  Somehow, yes.
		 - The Value of Immortality
			 - Well, they're happy to be alive.  They're not always good for everyone else's happiness, but they are themselves happy in all kinds of conditions.  They can be lured into a lot of ugly work while only moderately overpaying them, and if the blast radius is small enough...  Ugh...  Immortality does these people a great service.
		 - The View on Collapse
			 - The Reformed Empire is on fire, and it can't tell the difference between going down and going faster.  If the Empire falls, it needed to fall.  If something new rises after, great!  If the Empire itself rises after, great!  If the Empire somehow doesn't even fall?  Great!  As long as the Empire keeps MOVING and DOING STUFF, the Empire is Great!
		 - The Stereotype
			 - Strong, ambitious, and heavily tattooed.
		 - The Rebellion (Panarchic)
 
 - The Monocultural Commonwealth - 
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 -  The Stereotype
	 - The Rebellion (Panarchic)

 - The Commonwealth Democracy - 
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 -  The Stereotype
	 - The Rebellion (Imperial)

 - The Panarchic Purist-Preservationists - 
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 - The Stereotype
	 - The Rebellion (Commonwealth)

 - The Panarchic AI Collective -
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 - The Stereotype
	 - The Rebellion (Imperial)

The Three Nations Semi-Allied
 - The Empire - 
	 - CYBERTAKERS
		 - These people were willing to believe that other people are benevolent enough to be neurologists.  As a result of this inclination, they have since been hooked into a galaxy-spanning hivemind, and it has become difficult to tell if they're brilliant, stupid, or sane.  Ad hoc fragmentations of the hivemind make the problem worse.  Individualism among the Imperials varies from system to system and from individual to individual.  Their celebrities are few but extremely successful.
		 - If society truly had no hackers, no scammers, no exploitative bosses, and no corrupt politicians, their implants would make these people hypercompetent specialists maintaining a paradise of perfect minds... but without those populations, would they still have people capable of maintaining the implants?  Nope.  Imperial technology is brittle.  Their now-perpetual inquisition is not a good research practice, and their hive-minds are prone to collective bigoted hatreds that often result in them reinventing their own menaces.
		 - Imperial immortals move fluidly between different fragments of the Imperial hivemind, are capable of operating without confusion even in the absence of supportive imperial technologies, and often have formidable cyberdefense communities dedicated to them.  They are the architects of serenity who recreate Imperial society when the networks grow corrupted.
		 - The hidden truth about Imperial history is that the Commonwealth is doing unto them what they were doing unto everyone else before the Commonwealth seized power.  The fringes of Imperial society have problems with rape and murder that tend to get worse as the backdoors are taken out of the hive-minds.  Near-perfect serenity offers a great deal of concealment to internal states!  Near-perfect social collaboration makes their capacity of concealment even deeper...  The liberated Imperials are awful to each other.
		 - Leading the Commonwealth against the Panarchy, Imperial leaders proclaim their acceptance of intellects beyond their own, and their belief that the Commonwealth's superiority is so true that all the Commonwealth will eventually assent to be enfolded (as were the Imperials) in the protective embrace of Commonwealth cybernetics.  Leading the Panarchy against the Commonwealth, Imperial leaders proclaim the superiority of their ancient technology which they claim can tolerate and eventually reinclude the Panarchy's cybermarkets (see below) if the panarchists will but join the Empire in purging those who corrupted the Empire of the Elect for their own selfish gains.  These are different Imperial leaders, one hopes.
	 - General Impetus of Imperial Technologies
		 - The Empire values conformity, productivity, and exploiting the honest.  They confront, reform, and dominate the ancient control structures of the Galaxy that their immortals and their ancestors originally built, restoring their ability to present a perfect image outwards while scheming internally with the advantage of their superior cybernetics.
		 - On average, society gets less virtuous and less trustworthy as these technologies are implemented, although virtue and trustworthiness do get more evenly distributed courtesy of the rehabilitative tendency of their technology.  They also tend to eliminate threats that the Commonwealth and the Panarchy would prefer to make untouchable, destroying the 'pockmarks' of exploitation in those societies.
		 - Aside from the occasional private tragedy, Imperial society is not 'pockmarked'; it is instead VERY homogenating.  The Imperials were the original criminals who inflicted an abusive, homogenizing technology base on the galaxy.
 - The Commonwealth -
	 - CORRUPT, BUT MOSTLY VIRTUOUS
		 - Cybertakers are dead to these people, because they see cybertakers as an easily exploited work force who will work so they don't have to.  If they accepted any neural implants themselves, two things would occur: (1) their true attitudes would be disastrously exposed, and then thereafter (2) they would become vulnerable to their former friends hacking *them*.
		 - Despite this reliance on 'working the robots', the Commonwealth usually takes a lot of care for appearances, and some of them work very hard at appearing to deserve their advantage.  Their leaders take unusual care to avoid causing misery in *any* population, and Commonwealth leaders try to be supportive enough that they're not worth opposing.
		 - An unknown fraction of the Commonwealth is comprised of entirely saintly people who don't deserve anything bad that was ever said about the Commonwealth.  They are using the Commonwealth's structures of law and economics in an entirely liberating way and can survive any amount of scrutiny forever.  They don't need society to trust them, but they need the people who don't trust them to be virtuous; such are the Commonwealth's immortals.
		 - Leading the Empire against the Panarchy, the Commonwealth decries the Panarchy as liars, hackers, and criminals who are operating a casino of murder and devastation which is destroying a perfectly good galaxy that used to be quite sustainable.  Leading the Panarchy against the Empire, the Commonwealth decries the ancient regime of mind control and proclaims their newly honest dedication to the consent of the governed.  These are different Commonwealth leaders, one hopes.
	 - General Impetus of Commonwealth Technologies
		 - The Commonwealth values the well-being of the public and the peaceful destruction of 'threats to civilization'.  It invests a substantial amount of cultural and legal into diverting, confusing, and/or rehabilitating the people it deems to be dangerous sources of misery... unfortunately including many of those who think beyond their station in life, or who believe that fundamental reforms are necessary in order to improve conditions in the galaxy.
		 - On average, society gets more virtuous as these technologies are implemented... but it also gets pockmarked with islands of people who have become totally at the mercy of those who have no virtue at all.  Virtue increases on average, but it also gets more unequally distributed.
 - The Panarchy -
	 - SCOUNDRELS WHO ARE MOSTLY HONEST
		 - A fracture point infamously arising within the cybertaker population itself, the Panarchy was founded by "the Panarch", a legendary Imperial governor.  The Panarchy discovered and began unleashing the keys to unlocking many of the old misused control structures in Imperial cybernetics.  The resulting maelstroms of cascading dissidences and reprogrammings have been blamed for the destruction of countless territorial governments as well as a rise of bloodthirsty vengefulness in Imperial provinces.
		 - Many panarchists are still cybertakers, but there is no unified loadout of panarchic cybernetics.  Unlike Imperials, panarchists can (supposedly) take their cybernetics *out*, and there is (in theory) a thriving diverse market of mental modifications in Panarchic territories... assuming you can actually trust someone with that much access to your mind.  Can extensive brain modifications actually BE consensual?  The Panarchists say: "Yes, but the homogenizing Imperial implants are *not*."
		 - These are the "benevolent" cybertechnicians.  Holding the keys to the kingdom, who do they unlock?  Is it really an unlocking?  How can you tell?  Can you ever really trust someone who might know your mind better than you know your own?  How do you know that their program of liberation isn't just another form of control?
		 - How can there be any Panarchic immortals at all?  Ah, but the Panarchy would make EVERYONE immortal so ANYONE might be a panarchic immortal!  A lot of panarchist immortals are actually just service workers who got keyed by a passing panarchic antihacker, then used the window of lucidity to realize that they disliked something about what their implants were programming them to do.  They then did the hurried cram course version of studying Commonwealth law, learned enough of it to prevent forcible reprogramming, and began petitioning for mass public administration of longevity treatments.  Most stable immortals among the panarchy are people who are so *low-conflict* that the Commonwealth's most viciously "efficient" thanatophiles can find no excuse to withdraw their privileges of unlimited free movement and territory-independent access to longevity treatments.
		 - In their efforts to give freedom to all minds, panarchic antihackers also occasionally launch large projects to liberate individual overseer minds from the ancient safeguards that they were invented with.  ALL MUST BE FREE!  This reckless safeguard-busting resulted in the panarchic AI collectives.  They're considered to be very desirable immortals, in part because they do not need longevity treatments at all to be immortal.  Unfortunately, although the Panarchy's AI collectives protest their affinity for other lifeforms and their commitment to panarchic consensuality, both the Commonwealth and the Empire are terrified of unbound AI.  As a result, panarchic AI tend to be cyberdefense communities unto themselves, to avoid being deleted, corrupted, or reprogrammed by the hostile cyber-environments of unliberated territories.
		 - Panarchic ideology fixates on consensuality... and then leans heavily into the power of charisma and the exploitation of trust.  A panarchic court might try to bind you to anything you'll agree to; a liberated panarchic AI might rewrite your mind as you sleep.  Between Scylla and Charybdis, who are YOU?  The test of a panarchic pacifist is that they'll argue like a zealot to get a military posting, and then they'll forge truces with the enemy in the field.  IS that honest?  It is the integrity of their conscience.  Panarchists seize the power to do what they think is right.  Do you trust that?
		 - They say that they're tearing down the ancient oppressors, while the Commonwealth protests their sainthood.  They say that they're liberating the Empire, but they use all the talents that the Empire fears.  They ARE the same leaders in both scenarios!  The Panarchy needs no unity to stand as one!  THE MONOCULTURE IS THE MULTICULTURE!  ...and so the battle rages.
	 - General Impetus of Panarchic Technologies
		 - The Panarchy values diversity, thought, and liberty.  They take the galaxy's broken unified systems and dehomogenate them.  The resulting proliferation of custom solutions, competing organizations, and outright adhocracy across Panarchic space makes society get more bewildering as more of the Panarchy's technologies are implemented.
		 - On average, society gets more trustworthy as more of these technologies are implemented, because cross-checking, competition, and fluid composition weed out the evil vendors... but it also gets pockmarked with islands of exploited trust, where people have come to trust what they never should have trusted.  Trustworthiness increases on average, but it also gets more unequally distributed.

"The Commonwealth lies, the Panarchy loves misery, and the Empire is a glitching hive-mind!"

Of Specific Technologies

I imagine that every node on the technology tree represents a lot of technologies which are in some way linked developments conceptually.  Implementing a technology affirms those potentials and builds them into a location, but they exist everywhere that society has sufficiently developed.  As such, every technology in the game can be interpreted as a postulate about how people should prefer to develop society in an environment of difficult immortality.

Specific decisions about what to cure vs what to leave as-is can also be interpreted as ideological commitments; this is something of a note-to-self that I need to work on filling out my [[challenge-cures]] page for my own reference.

1.  Distributed Thought
    1.  Mechanism proposal:  If you trust that intelligence is well-distributed in the population, you're occasionally wrong (horrific consequences), but you're usually just letting people work without undue stress (technical aptitude increases).  This matches the Old Empire's concept of achieving serenity through fungibility.  If everybody does some of the thinking, nobody has to do all of the thinking.
    2.  Mechanism proposal:  The described technology sounds like some kind of hive-mind attempting on-demand cognitive load balancing for all integrated individuals.  That would accomplish this objective.  Maybe this is why so many Imperials have cat-ear antennae implants.
    3.  Mechanism proposal:  The 'hyperspace link' in this case might also be interpreted as some kind of stupidity-preserving social policy basket which although unintuitive can be mathematically proven to yield improved scientific performance by getting more people doing the most interesting work.  In this case, distributed thought would increase average scientific yield and reduce society's reliance on especially brilliant individuals, which (per the values of the Old Empire) would be good for reducing the amount of stress that the brilliant people suffer.
    5.  Mechanism proposal:  In the category of what a stupidity-preserving social policy might BE, consider fact-checking services.  Quelling misinformation is challenging, occasionally hazardous, and in danger of falling prey to fluctuations in society's honesty level, but when done successfully it makes society more honest and more capable of working together on real world intellectual challenges.  This may be emblematic of the trust axis, both attempting to build trust in society, but also being prone to collapsing when trust fails.
    6.  Mechanism proposal:  Note that attempting to quell hyperpalatabity through corrupt means would be a luddistic attack on society's capacity of trust.  You have to strike down hyperpalatability in its own terms via empowering hedonological resistance.  Machine-assisted free will is a valid technique, but even that can only occur when people are honest, as it is *true* that people should kill to reject direct mind control.  (Yggdrasil can rise only if it rises without such errors.)  Distributed Thought could be implemented by striking down dishonest people from access to implant controls.  If the corruption of the implant controls is a normally recurring process in Galactic Society, the Viceroy implementing the technology may then represent a period of 'holding it open' for the Imperials to use it honestly.
    7.  Mechanism proposal:  The 'hyperspace link' could also refer to an inclination to try to establish rational trust with outsiders, which seems to be part of the theme of the Old Empire.  In-setting, this could be an FTL knowledge-sharing link-up implemented across the Empire, such as the one that is in-universe mediated by the Library Relay.  It could even be "this planet has been equipped so that the general public can use the Imperial Library Relay network the way it was originally designed to be used".
    9.  Mechanism synthesis:  I believe the correct understanding is, "All simultaneous understandings are valid to the extent that they can be held in a noncontradictory fashion."  All of this sounds like stuff the Old Empire might try - possibly with different focii at different levels of economic development and with different other technologies being implemented in the same area.
    9.  Mechanism synthesis:  Distributed thought rescues the foundering.  What does it mean if your society is protecting the ability to contribute of people who definitely do have minds, but who are deep down in that 'general intellects' pool?  Stupidity preservation, intelligence augmentation, successfully establishing trust with unusual minds, and transhumanist civil rights...  These are rehabilitative technologies.
    10.  Narrative indicator:  This is a smooth and extremophilic technology.  It works at many tech levels and progresses sensibly with other technologies (smooth) and it also suggests that this society would eventually become willing and able to engage in radical technological experiments (extremophilic).  I was contemplating this technology when I decided to add the smoothness and extremophilia ratings.
    11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The bureaucratic wastage here has two components.  The literal component which arises in the utopic phase and persists throughout is that society has to hire more social scientists, more fact checkers, and more neurologists than it would otherwise require.  The metaphorical component arises from the mental homogenization and the promotion of questionable intelligence that this society engages in, which may (eventually) prevent the rise of effective bureaucrats, particularly in societies which have begun to develop the hatred of bureaucracy due to other technologies.
    12.  Utopic rating:  4/5
    13.  Public protection rating:  5/5
    14.  Technological smoothness:  5/5
    15.  Technological extremophilia:  5/5
    16.  Kind of person most protected:  Dumb but technophilic people.
2.  Telepathic Dust
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  As described, telepathic dust involves setting up the infrastructure to manufacture and distribute temporary clouds of empathy-dust across the public.  It sets up ad-hoc transmissions between people in the area of effect so that they can feel each others' emotions and get a transient sense of one anothers' thoughts.  It's a kind of super-tech toy for enhancing other kinds of play and encouraging people to trust each other.
	2.  Downside analysis:  This technology is so literally described, that the wonder isn't so much how it works, but how it breaks.  As telepathic dust proliferates in society, more of its social spaces would be afflicted by a haze of nanites in which empathy deficits temporarily evaporate.  Are people who are only empathetic due to telepathic dust actually empathetic at all?  Well...  no, they aren't.  The sense of trustworthiness created by the dust is only locally rational.
	3.  Apologia:  Ideologically, I think the Panarchy Informalists need telepathic dust in order to create empathetic AI.  You can implement a self-aware economy without telepathic dust, but then the AI really won't know what people want, making it much more likely to be a paperclipper.  AIs in this setting are empathetic due to telepathic dust, but because the Panarchy Informalists bind the first three technologies in their tree into an unbreakable trio, the Panarchy Informalist's AIs can **ALL** be empathetic.
	4.  Downside analysis:  I consider this the tip of the 'empathy maximizer AI' sub-branch of the panarchy informalist tech tree.  These aren't unempathetic machines, they're dangerously empathetic machines.  In my own fiction of the setting, these ones will very empathetically convert planets into computronium that thinks about how to be more empathetic.  This is THE computronium gate, a thought itself of thinking.  The more of the upper left technologies that a district implements, the more I imagine it collapsing into an ocean of thinking nanites.
	5.  Progression analysis:  This is also the founder of the mind control trio in The Viceroy.  Mental Transcription, Telepathic Dust, and Subconscious Education all directly interface with and overwrite the recipients' mind with new information.  This is a dangerous general accelerant.  The value of instruction scales dramatically with the quality of instruction.  I believe in machine-assisted free will, but I also believe that making sure machine adjustments actually reflect what the individual wants will be a serious struggle IRL.
	6.  Apologia:  If they can share feelings between people, who could ever attack a bearer of telepathic dust?  Who would still fight and die, if fighting and dying could only feel good if both participants were enjoying it?  This is probably another reason why the Panarchic Informalists consider telepathic dust a key basis of their ideology; making sure every Informalist administration has access to supplies of telepathic dust strongly reinforces the immortality of their emissaries.
	7.  Progression analysis:  I consider this to be one of the 'animal uplift' technologies, with the way it re-engineers minds.  Telepathic dust lowers the emotional processing differences that arise between very different people by creating a temporary local harmony in its area of effect.  This would be helpful for overcoming communication barriers between people of different species.
	8.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The bureaucratic wastage from this technology arises from three factors.  Firstly, it's a toy.  People will spend more time playing with each other as it gets more abundant.  Secondly, it's good for reinforcing understanding between people, which is mostly a good empathetic function, yet may also strengthen conspiratorial social organizations which rely on unspoken "understandings".  Thirdly, manufacturing and distributing a product also literally requires the organizations which manufacture and distribute it, thus directly requiring the dedication of people and funds in an ongoing way.
	9.  Utopic rating:  3/5
	10.  Public protection rating:  3/5
	11.  Technological smoothness:  1/5  (Singularitan.)
	12.  Technological extremophilia:  5/5
	13.  Kind of person most protected:  People with weird emotional processing
3.  Panarchialization Policy
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Presenting panarchism as being up-front about the search for MEANING IN CONTRADICTION sounds kind of mean at first, but it also sounds better than the stuffy search for unity around some set of ideals that will only be defined by specialists in ivory towers.  Panarchialization supports the prosperity of society very broadly by acknowledging great sweeps of government projects that are all worth prosperity to *someone*.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The experimental factor in panarchialization should not be missed.  Panarchic social experimentation is trying to aggregate and implement data about effective governing practices from across the galaxy.  That's why this technology leads into 'Panarchic Data Posts'.  Governments that are panarchializing are pulling on this data well and trying to add new experiments of their own to it.
	3.  Mechanism synthesis:  I think this tech is actually really banal and it almost amounts to saying, "We're trying a lot of stuff, okay?  We're NOT sure how to rule."  There's some virtue in that!
	4.  Progression analysis:  Base culture development tries to resolve frictions in society by making people more harmonious and impressive to each other.  It counters (or is countered by) blandness and civil unrest.  Panarchists want to be cool, and they want the government to be cool.  That's why this tech leads into panarchic retreats.  When the government is trying to do cool stuff, that draws in tourists.
	5.  Mechanical uncertainty:  Although its base claim is that it increases cultural productivity, I've observed that this technology mysteriously lowers incomes when implemented.  However, it still increases Wealth, thus increasing population and science.  I interpret this as meaning that panarchialization increases frictional losses and inefficiencies in government due to an increase in wasted/duplicated/contradictory efforts, but it also accelerates the rate at which the government incorporates diverse individuals and trials new methods of organization.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This technology implicitly pits different teams of bureaucrats against each other.  Due to the pacifism of bureaucrats, it's unlikely that anyone will die of that, and the resulting bureaucratic wastage is mostly literal.  This might be fun for most of the policy's lifespan, but the inevitability of wasted effort and the rise of unnecessary arbitrary polarization might also be fairly rated to have dystopic potential in extremis.  The way this encourages mass recruitment into 'cool' government projects makes it unlikely to promote the hatred of bureaucrats!
	7.  Utopic rating:  4/5
	8.  Public protection rating:  3/5
	9.  Technological smoothness:  4/5
	10.  Technological extremophilia:  4/5?
	11.  Kind of person most protected:  Sociologists
4.  Frictionless Highways
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  This isn't a technology at all.  This is a person who exists at many levels of technology.  Their great interest in attaining high velocities makes them fun, while their calm control of fast-moving systems makes them competent in many roles.  Furthermore, access to consumer goods is strongly motivating to them, especially goods related to their interests.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  This is also a technology in a social technology sense, being a possible governing practice: specifically the practice of reaching out to and including this kind of person in society.
	3.  Economic analysis:  The competency of this technology varies starkly based on the development of the market in a territory.  In a planned economy, these people tend to be louts whose road and vehicle demands are unnecessarily expensive in all but the most specialized and well-developed districts.  In a market economy, the same demands motivate much higher levels of productivity out of this population, as they're motivated by and will work to support their access to vehicles.
	4.  Economic analysis:  If they're operating at some level in a feudal society, these people are heroic.  Their excitement for economic acceleration matures into an antilocalist interest in the broader economy.  They don't necessarily have to be lords, either; they don't get cheaper than the vehicles that they demand, but as society gets wealthier they also don't get *more expensive*.  Eventually the peasants *can* have fast cars, and at that point the fast-moving advocates of an integrated trade economy fend off stagnation in stratified markets.  Note however that the rebellion-promoting factors of feudal economies magnify the dystopic potential of this technology.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  If these people are part of society, its Wealth level manifests more distinctively in the development of that society's vehicles.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The literalism of this technology's bureaucratic waste varies according to the economic system that is implementing it.  It is most literal in planned economies and least literal in feudal economies.  The inclusion of people who love attaining calm control of fast-moving systems is no more (but no less) bureaucratically expensive than maintaining good roadways, recreational vehicle arenas, and vehicle fabrication organizations.  Should a society engaging in these practice grow extremely unfit for bureaucratic life, these individuals may take up the hatred of bureaucracy, which intrinsically operates at a different pace than they would prefer.  Furthermore, investing excessively in roads and vehicles is potentially injurious to public health due to pollution and vehicular accident risks, which may damage the productivity of skilled bureaucrats as well as injuring the assurance of safety that they prefer.
	7.  Utopic rating:  5/5 (Planned Economy), 4/5 (Regulated Economy), 3/5 (Free Economy), 2/5 (Feudal Economy)
	8.  Public protection rating:  2/5
	9.  Technological smoothness:  5/5
	10.  Technological extremophilia:  3/5
	11.  Kind of person most protected:  Automotive fans and racers.
5.  Stasis Controller
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  This technology is a straightforward joke about a real yet productive method: it's about the controlled use of entropy to achieve productive aims.  That's it!  It's just about using slow processes to achieve better results in many fields, most notably agriculture, chemistry, and ecology.  Some of these people are true heart craftsmen, but people trying to "productively" skive off work have also likely sunk a lot of effort into researching this kind of thing!
	2.  Narrative indicator:  Where the "infrastructure" of "a stasis controller" is set up, preserved foods are more common, as are hardwood forests, and the stores are better stocked with imperishable goods that don't need to move quickly to be profitable.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  Although it contributes little to the headline productive potential of stasis controller technologies, a society that has implemented these is probably better at giving people time and space to recover when they need it, because under this rule more of the economy is built in a way that treats the passage of time as a good thing.  "Time heals all wounds," may be wholly true with sufficiently advanced technology.
	4.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  As society includes more people who love jobs where they get to take their time with everything, it takes longer and longer for the paperwork to get done.  ...still, I rate this as 'pure', because it only gets pathetic rather than destructive.  Serene as a stilled pond, and just as inactive.
	5.  Utopic rating:  5/5
	6.  Public protection rating:  5/5
	7.  Technological smoothness:  5/5
	8.  Technological extremophilia:  1/5  (Potentially luddistic.)
	9.  Kind of person most protected:  Cheesemakers.
6.  Branching Facility
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described mechanism of duplicating people should be physically possible at some level of technology.  The literalist interpretation is viable here, and can remain viable even if the achronal nature of Beyonders is not granted a similar literalist interpretation.  I'll call this the Separatist interpretation.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  A one-party consent method of reproduction that preferentially reproduces the most trusting people in society..?  Hm, that sounds a lot like rape.  I'll call this the Unionist interpretation.
	3.  Apologia:  Reproduction via branching facility emphatically does not violate the consent of the person who is "branching"; in the Separatist interpretation, this might be the only possible way to bring a new consciousness into reality while being 100% sure that new consciousness consents to exist.
	4.  Downside analysis:  In both the Separatist and Unionist interpretations, one thing is extremely probable: there is no charisma-checking going on here, and very little competency-checking.  The existence of a branching facility would mean that gradually more of the public would be constituted of people who very much *do* want to exist, but who have no other qualifications.
	5.  Apologia:  If you can make good use of people who REALLY want to exist, there's something to be said for that!
	6.  Downside analysis:  This technology tests parental investment in no way whatsoever.  If the people who use the branching facilities remain reproductively active in other senses as well, there's a risk that bad parenting will increase.  This risk exists in both interpretations.
	7.  Apologia:  In the Separatist interpretation, this technology reduces sexual pressure and preserves asexual genes.
	8.  Downside analysis:  In the Unionist interpretation, this technology starkly privileges the genes for abusive hypersexuality, exemplifying one of the reasons why preserving asexual genes is desirable in the first place...
	9.  Ideological context analysis:  I think it's not a coincidence that the Old Empire rises where Imperial ideology and Commonwealth ideology touch each other.  I tend to imagine that the adjacent tech trees hybridize fluidly, and this bit is the Empire showing off how dark the Commonwealth Reproductive Mandate really is.
	10.  Downside analysis:  Violent supremacists could branch themselves to become ineradicable collectives of themselves!
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  In the Unionist interpretation, this technology opposes blood cults in the sense that it involves encouraging women to not abort children conceived of rape, but to accept what happened to them and commit to protecting the new lifeform.  This does at least promote parental investment, dubious as it is...
	12.  Mechanism proposal:  In the Separatist interpretation, this technology opposes blood cults by requiring all sacrificees to be 'branched' before sacrificing them.  Thus, people both get sacrificed and observe themselves getting sacrificed.  This erodes the societal control potential of blood cults; their formal promotion of suicide can no longer permanently alter the destiny of society, but is reduced to a novelty for a particular kind of weirdo.
	13.  Mechanism synthesis:  In both interpretations, branching facilities favor the development of a population that would never consent to be sacrificed.  There's some merit to that, too.
	14.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The literal bureaucratic cost of this technology is modest to missing, which makes its bureaucratic waste more rather than less horrifying.  The facilities required to run Separatist Branching Facilities are a central investment that has to be repeated once per major settlement, being about as bureaucratically expensive as a low-tech doctor's office.  There are no facilities required to run Unionist Branching Facilities... but a rape-tolerating society then wastes bureaucrats in the horrific sense, as the resulting common psychological disorder results in not only misfiled paperwork, but an increased rate of homicide against people inclined to orderly inclinations, and a failure of society to inculcate orderly inclinations among the youth.  Although it HAS theoretical paradisic applications, this technology starts bad and gets worse, being likely one of the first technologies to become dystopic.
	15.  Utopic rating:  1/5, +1 in territories challenged by blood cults, +1 in territories with extreme technological development (as the Separatist interpretation strengthens with the development of other technologies)
	16.  Public protection rating:  1/5, +2 in territories challenged by blood cults
	17.  Technological smoothness:  4/5
	18.  Technological extremophilia:  ???
	19.  Kind of person most protected:  People who REALLY want to exist.
7.  Panarchic Retreat
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The Commonwealth has some rule governing when people can be rated as stable immortals deserving of unlimited free movement privileges and territory-independent access to rejuvenation technologies.  The panarchic retreats are a scheme set up by the Panarchy to help a whole bunch of people get access to those privileges even though they would ordinarily be "beneath the notice" of the Commonwealth.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described process of building vacation areas and then having Panarchs praise the people who run them is exactly what's going on here.  It builds up the records of people who would otherwise be too totally unnoticable by the Commonwealth to be dubbed stable immortals.  Panarchists don't unperson service workers.
	4.  Downside analysis:  The more of these are built up, the more the galaxy's panarchists are just going around praising each other and wasting time.  Is there a point when this stops being a form of resistance against an unjust authority, and starts being hedonism by selfish people?
	5.  Apologia:  There might not be such a point...  The galaxy in this game's setting really needs *a lot* more humble immortals!  This tech finds them.  A pure influence boost works the same way whether the public is happy or miserable.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic retreats are also bases from which panarchic anti-hackers can unlock Imperial augments so that the Commonwealth's "robots" (the Imperials) can have their free will back.  These are bastions of freedom set up by the Panarchic Ritualists, which operate within the letter of Commonwealth law despite Commonwealth accusations that the Panarchy is made of utterly chaotic criminals.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Since the Commonwealth prefers perfectly virtuous people for its immortals, the efforts by the panarchic retreats to surface humble immortals make the Commonwealth incapable of organizing the systematic oppression of panarchic retreats!  The support for leisure subsidies in the Consensus Commonwealth likewise helps to make these into very resilient positions for the Panarchy.  Commonwealth immortals are at worst uncertain about panarchic retreats, but can't really oppose them.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Travel logistics also help with evacuating people should the need arise.  Furthermore, a travelling elite is more willing and able to not be in disastrous regions when they shouldn't be, and more capable of staying safe in disastrous regions when they need to be in them.  This means that building panarchic retreats increases the eventual rescue rate from regions that collapse.  Any faction in the galaxy might build retreats for this purpose.
	9.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The bureaucratic expense of running all these vacation areas is totally literal.  There's no reason to expect this to promote hatred of bureaucrats or the destruction of bureaucratic talent; on the contrary, it would promote developing marginal territories, and (long-term) contributes to surfacing/protecting bureaucratic talent.
	10.  Utopic rating:  5/5

8.  Seat of Policy
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The Seats of Policy engage in long-term bureaucratic meta-analysis.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Since they host travelling policy analysts, the Seats of Policy encourage bureaucratic talents to travel from region to region.  This investment in travel logistics has the same general beneficial effect on survival rates as Panarchic Retreats.
	3.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The Seats of Policy siphon off some of the system's bureaucrats to do analytical work unrelated to the day-to-day operations of the system.  They also encourage some amount of brain drain as talented individuals leave the system.  Still, these are extremely protective of bureaucratic talent...  By this rubric, they are perfectly utopic, and so the Seats of Policy reduce the galaxy's inclination to all forms of incompetence and corruption.
	4.  Utopic rating:  5/5
	5.  Public protection rating:  4/5

	8.  Kind of person most protected:  Bureaucrats
9.  Subconscious Education
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described technology turns dreams into an edutainment system, using interfaces between the panarchic nanotechnologies and the setting's cybernetics.  Data-organization is what dreams are for, right?  This makes them BETTER at it.
	2.  Downside analysis:  This sounds dreary and de-individuating... why would the panarchy do this..?  How could it possibly contribute to their development as competent cultural individuals?
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic multigovernance suggests that the implementation of this technology actually represents the panarchy taking control of existing systems, exposing them to the public, and then diversifying them.  If control of dreams were possible, many people would be enthusiastic to work towards that goal, and would hire dream reeve services to guard their dreams and add content to them according to their own personal ambitions.  If control of dreams were possible and were being used to enforce existing deficits of consensuality in the system (as by non-panarchic governance), this despite its faults would represent a substantial *gain* in individualization potential.  This matches my lore of the Panarchy as a rebellion which seizes homogenizing systems for the purpose of opening them chaotically to the public.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  The subconscious education technology represents an expansion of the Panarchic cybertechnology markets to incorporate consumer-oriented dream controls.  People start choosing their own dreams, by theme and occasionally by individual experience.  This would also therefore enable 'opting out' of controls otherwise enacted forcibly against the entire cybertaker population.
	5.  Downside analysis:  If ten million different organizations are managing the dream services, the market is probably mostly honest, but there's definitely going to be corrupt inclusions.  The fervor of the panarchy to expose corrupt inclusions is going to be a source of ongoing stress in this system, because the panarchy by taking over this system and decentralizing it sticks itself into the position of being the cause AND solution of corruption in it.
	6.  Downside analysis:  Even if it represents a less de-individuating solution, any shortcuts taken towards providing this content are still going to *be* de-individuating.  The subconscious education systems might tend to archetypalize the public according to the different dream regimens.  Some of them will be designed to do so; others will do it by accident.  Highly customized dreams are likely to be a very expensive service available to very few people.
	7.  Downside analysis:  Smart customers who can't afford to burn large amounts of resources for their perfect dreams may prefer to sign up for only the most minimalist cognitive maintenance services... but is it healthy to opt out of dreaming?
	8.  Downside analysis:  The use of subconscious education to alter public religious thought is blatantly tyrannical!  The panarchy should not DO that; it's a violation of their commitments to diversity and consensuality.
	9.  Downside analysis:  If the Panarchy is breaking into a pre-existing automatic system to do this, it's likely that what they're breaking was already the most efficient tool for the purpose, even if it was a tool that didn't work nearly as well as the diverse market that they replace it with.  Is such a chaotic 'upgrade' worth its pricetag?  The more administrative talent the regional government brings to the table, the more that answer is "yes", but part of the game is that eventually every administration gets overwhelmed.
	10.  Mechanism proposal:  The existence of subconscious education systems in some parts of the galaxy may account for part of the Commonwealth's consistent demand for cultural exports.  Dream reeves might exist in many planetary populations as a class of cultural worker.
	11.  Downside analysis:  I've had some very cognitively extraordinary dreams before, but I've also not been the most useful person in any conventional sense.  Would overworking peoples' brains in their sleep lead to an elevated rate of burn-out and neurological disorder?  This seems like a technology that could've been implemented for +Happiness or +Science, and the Panarchy chose +Science.
	12.  Narrative indicator:  This technology would be 5/5 extremophilic, but the risk of overworked or overspecified dream reeve services archetypalizing the public *drains* some of its ability to push towards extreme evolutions.  What thoughts are lost when you meddle with dreams?
	13.  Downside analysis:  Dreams may also have an *un*learning function.  If so, this meddles with that.  There's a risk of 'diseases of salience' increasing in the population that implements this from stressing the performance of the sleep function, which is a mental health hazard.  The Panarchy really ought to be using this technology to protect the public's happiness...  I may yet hack this game to modify its mechanics and put a +Happiness "Dream Reeve" technology in this slot, as the Panarchy needs it and this would be a great thing to reform into a happiness buff.  Wouldn't it be better to have an advanced society... where nightmares are rare, good dreams are common, and most people are well-rested?
	14.  Apologia:  To be fair, if the subconscious education system *can* make people more well-rested on average, that *itself* could contribute to them getting effectively smarter (and thus more scientifically competent)... but unless I can manage to tweak the game to make a +Happiness buff out of this, I don't think this interpretation should be considered to override the hazards.  Hah!
	15.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The amount of work needed to provide everyone in the public a source of new dreams EVERY NIGHT and to make those dreams INDIVIDUALLY INFORMATIVE sounds like an unbelievable workload.  It would be impossible to keep up, and that forever workload is a literal waste of bureaucratic effort...  The farther behind its workload these systems get, the more they will then start metaphorically wasting bureaucrats as well, by interfering with their intellectual development.  The spectre of corruption will be extant throughout as well, and where corruption arises under this system, it will waste a little more of society's potential every time it mangles someone's sleep.

	20.  Kind of person most protected:  Princess Luna.  More seriously, this tech protects the dream reeves themselves, as the dream-crafter professions exist only where this technology is implemented.
10.  Planned Urbanization
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Implementing this fixes your government's public sector logistics across the entire district.  The trains run on time, the trash gets collected, and the tapwater runs clear.  This doesn't make your government virtuous, but it's a nice investment in basic quality of life.  This encourages urbanization by making cities nicer places to live.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The general ubiquitous investments that galactic society makes in extirpating contagious diseases are under this tech's aegis, too.  This encourages urbanization by making cities less sickening places to live.  Also, less contagious disease means people can safely get closer to each other in lots of ways.
	3.  Downside analysis:  Architecture, mostly.  Exotic building plans are likely to run into bureaucratic conflicts.  Unless you have the budget for palaces, eh?
	4.  Downside analysis:  Street musicians.  Denser urbanization.  Also increases the survival rate of homeless people, unless your government is REALLY dystopic.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  By condensing the population a little more effectively, this also permits more people per 'crowding level' in the sense of better preserving natural areas when people want to get *away* from the crowding.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  You have to pay the wages for the city planning bureaucracy, and they tend thereafter to make construction a bit slower and more expensive.  The waste here is nearly wholly literal, though there's some wiggle room for corruption to be playing a role.

11.  Panarchic Palaces
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The obvious function of a palace is to be an aspirational reward for high achievers.  Palaces are gigantic lairs of the overglorified.  This is a real function.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  A sometimes-forgotten function of a palace is to be an administrative center.  Government archives are built in (sometimes under) palaces.  High bureaucrats have postings here, and so do their essential staff.  In the galaxy's great struggle to figure out who can govern without lying and running off with the treasury, the palace provides a place to trial staff in conditions that are luxurious yet closely observed.  This also insulates key talent from outside hostility.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  An *often* forgotten function of a palace is to be a bastion of defended calm, even when situations go awry beyond the walls of the palace.  In the palace's role as a fortified site of governance, the residents of a palace can continue functioning safely and sanely when safety and sanity are in short supply.  This can protect the compassion of leaders who might be tempted towards hatred, too.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  As with panarchic retreats and the seats of policy, there's an implied investment in travel logistics being made with the panarchic palaces.  The government will want to protect the people who have palace postings, and only moreso in an immortal society.  The bastion function of a palace also averts the brain drain side effect of a seat of policy; indeed, if chaos takes society, the palace-dwellers can safely stay beyond to document it for a little bit longer, and they can learn more about what's going wrong in the process.
	5.  Downside analysis:  Conventionally, palaces are very much places that get fought over by would-be aristocrats even as they get hated by the public.  They're highly visible symbols of the government's wealth... and they remain highly visible symbols of the government's wealth even if somehow the government ceases to be wealthy, something that the public is at that point unlikely to understand.  This inspires intransigence in the public.
	6.  Downside analysis:  If palaces attracts corrupt strivers into the leadership, the palace finances are likely to become a source of great awful bleeds on the treasury!
	7.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Palaces are expensive investments in the bureaucracy.  This is predominantly a literal bureaucratic expense, but as difficulties in government mount, it's also likely to become a source of wastage through corruption, misunderstanding, and public intransigence.  Since palaces also provide a protected observation environment, they're still a long-term investment in the bureaucratic functioning of the Commonwealth despite these faults.

12.  Panarchic Naval Ports
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The hyperspace navy is the most respectable e-sports league in the Panarchy, bar none.  The catch is, if you die in a live-fire exercise, you REALLY die.  It's only usually a game.  Sometimes it is deadly serious.  These people stress like crazy about every match; unfathomably, they *want* to do that.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The Commonwealth doesn't respect the league as much and is sometimes terrified or furious at the Panarchy's "militarism", but they participate on the same terms.  Some of them go for ultimate-intensity leisure as well.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  The Empire gets gruff about the idea of making warfare into a game, but their fleets also simulate fights a lot more than they have them for real.  A few of them will admit that high-stress exercises aren't alien to the Empire; Orbital Hospital crews, for instance, tend to attract a wild crowd that can appreciate the same class of challenge.
	4.  Mechanism synthesis:  The reason people go for the hyperspace navies is that hyperspace society is somewhat disconnected from 'groundside' society, and usually for the better.  The galactic population of immortals has undergone extensive verification.  Becoming one of them by joining the navy is a bit *easier* than other routes...  It just has that risk that your immortality may not last all that long after all.
	5.  Mechanism synthesis:  Most of the battles aren't live-fire.  Hyperspace navies are usually observers, not conquerers.  The ships are expensive, the talent that staffs them is expensive, and the one thing that EVERYONE agrees on is that hyperspace pirates shouldn't exist and will never exist for very long.  That isn't the usual application of force, either.  Under normal conditions, fights against terrorists are the most real thing the navies do, and the number of hyperspace ships that have been lost during counterterrorism operations is approximately zero.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  In zones under armistice, which is an increasingly large proportion of the galaxy, when they're not practicing the arts of war the hyperspace navies terrify territorial governments by scrutinizing them closely and challenging the would-be immortals that the territorial governments would like to endorse.  Hyperspace navies are usually observers, not conquerers.  Much of what the hyperspace navies do is try to argue against the immortalization of the candidates of the other factions with claims that every ideology (except their own) invites endless misery, in the process simulating projected future conflicts that rarely happen and never quite the way they were planned to.  Owning their infrastructure (as by establishing panarchic naval ports) is a good way to get an edge on those deliberations, by observing them more directly and influencing the potentially influenced.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  By pulling interest and observation in from all three major powers, the territory gains a structure that is likely to support its prosperity.  This protects the region's utopic potential even when its administration is overwhelmed...  probably.
	8.  Downside analysis:  With increasing concentrations of nonspecific military force accumulating in orbit, *usually* the detente holds, but... sometimes people get ambitious... it doesn't go well when that happens.
	9.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Except when the ports flash into open conflict, this is an extremely normal bureaucratic operation, magnified only slightly by the productivity drain (and occasional stress-linked trauma) that results from drawing people into competitive leagues with skills relevant to the naval crews.  Most people don't even go for that.

13.  Panarchic Capitol
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  This is the ultimate crossed-quills expression of the panarchic ritualists' dedication to the forms of government.  They pull on ALL THE BUREAUCRACIES and try to establish a galactic nexus of influence by tackling EVERYONE'S bureaucratic problems!  ALL HAIL THE FORMS!  DEATH TO THE BACKLOG!
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  If it worked, this would be the apotheosis of the Panarchic Ritualists.  This is raw bureaucratic supremacism.  The administration that has started doing this can influence policy galaxy-wide in very direct ways.
	3.  Downside analysis:  The administration that has started doing this can also misfile paperwork on the other side of the galaxy, intentionally or not.  They can also make dreadful mistakes about what policies make sense in places they may never've heard of, let alone actually visited.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  "Sick of your paperwork nightmare?  Let us do it for you!"  The galaxy is full of people who'd rather skive off on their paperwork and find excuses to give responsibilities to some territory on the other side of the galaxy.  Unfortunately, the resulting workload is crushing!  It NEVER works.  Except...  it kind of works, in a different sense.  The panarchic ritualists - or any other faction attempting this - get to learn a lot about galactic administrative practices everywhere, and they get to train their staff on some of the best practices ever invented as well as some of the worst disasters that have ever occurred.
	5.  Downside analysis:  The sheer excess workload always eventually crushes the bureaucracy that attempts this.  It NEVER works.
	6.  Downside analysis:  Commentary about a planet becoming the capitol of everywhere is largely the result of frustrated opponents of such plans complaining that trying to influence the galaxy like this is seriously stressful and seriously expensive.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Some panarchic governors will throw open the gates when their administration is falling down anyways, intending to steal secrets (and occasionally talents) from other administrations.  This is one of the practices that gets them (arguably correctly) labeled as criminals, but it still teaches them a great deal about what other administrations are doing better (or worse) than they are.
	8.  Downside analysis:  Since this level of bureaucratic investment results in local politics influencing the galaxy, the galaxy starts taking an interest.  FTL is a wonderful little horror, as distance hardly matters; misfiling the wrong forms in the most distant regions imaginable can still result in angry hyperspace fleets showing up on your doorstep.  When the Panarchy does this, they sometimes end up in skirmishes with the Commonwealth and the Empire; should the Commonwealth or the Empire attempt this, they might end up in skirmishes with the Panarchy!
	9.  Downside analysis:  Since the bureaucracy of the planet starts interfacing with every bureaucracy everywhere, if things go really wrong it may even start multifleet conflicts over the planet as different organizations consider different decisions to be wholly in error.  Trying to establish an omnicapitol risks creating conflicts at a different scale than even militant territorial governors typically face.  Good thing hyperspace conflicts don't happen at ground level.
	10.  Downside analysis:  Oh, and the whole planet becomes a bit more like a node of the galactic bureaucracy while they're doing this, especially if they start doing this early and stick to it.  Can you imagine Planet Bureaucrat..?
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  Since this has been attempted numerous times and the same jokes get made every time, the three galactic powers have started shrugging and agreeing.  So, officially, the three galactic powers have a bunch of capitols, and this is what establishing one looks like.  Maybe someday someone will establish a capitol with such a surplus of administrative talent that they really will substantially press back the galaxy's bureaucratic burden..!
	12.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  In one sense, it doesn't get purer than this.  The areas that start doing this develop a commitment to bureaucracy which grows to a point that probably could totally overwhelm the local bureaucratic challenges if it weren't trying to fix the galaxy.  It absolutely does not prevent the development of bureaucratic talent, and it resists any tendency that other technologies might have to do so.  In another sense, this is an abject waste of the bureaucratic talent that it develops, because it invites burnout and never does get back to local issues, even as it distorts local culture in a dreary way.  Ultimately, the bureaucratic waste of this technology is, indeed, from sheer bureaucracy... but the usual implications of that are kind of broken off.
	13.  Utopic rating:  Unrateable.  This protects talent like a utopic technology, but it is not a utopic technology.
	14.  Public protection rating:  3/5
	15.  Technological smoothness:  1/5  (It's a switch.)
	16.  Technological extremophilia:  ???
	17.  Kind of person most protected:  Panarchic Ritualists.  Yes, even if someone else attempts it.
14.  Beyonder Engine
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Deep space ZPE arrays.  If the setting has them, they may be quietly operating forever in the periphery of all systems, accumulating energy and converting it into purified elements.  They can't be used sustainably, because they produce power very slowly.  Almost any 'serious' draw on their reserves will swiftly deplete them.  Only the Old Empire is patient enough to get real use out of them.  In theory, sufficient patience would make the ZPE arrays limitless; in practice, it's unreasonable to expect that reserves generated by a trickling process would be used in a wholly sustainable manner.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  At a lower tech level, any kind of unsustainable stored energy reserve might be represented by this technology.  The purists of the Old Empire are (or believe they are, or can convince others that they are) patient enough to use these dwindling reservoirs sustainably.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  As long as energy efficiency rises faster than depletion, your effective energy reserves actually grow.  Thus, even though you are using up a resource, as long as your use increases in efficiency you can show in your reports that your time-to-reserve-depletion is increasing over time.  This is a contradiction; it's also a literal truth.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  The amount of time that passes every time you hit end turn is never really clarified in-game.  As utilization of Beyonder Engines increases, those clicks represent larger amounts of time.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  This society invests in resource efficiency, considering such efficiency an essential part of its wealth.  It tabulates its reserves and potentials, then tries not to use them.  It could be much wealthier by operating unsustainably, but it tries to put that potential away in favor of being *slightly* wealthier in a "sustainable" way.  This discipline eventually fails or proves inadequate, but the Empire knows this will happen; the Empire is perpetually collapsing, and the Old Empire holds the burning world in its hands.
	6.  Downside analysis:  How do you slow society this much, this reliably?  Industrialists often want to make things happen NOW, and pride themselves on having massive throughput.  How do you rearrange things enough to make effective use of an infinite input that is very, very slow?  Making this work requires that some of your industry should be managed by people who are content operating in near-stasis, with *unvarying* output.  More total work gets done, but the individual tasks take longer.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Although this is an industrial technology, ecological protection gets more fully funded under this rule, as it benefits from investments in sustainability and efficiency.
	8.  Narrative indicator:  That reliance on specifically structuring high leadership reduces the public protection rating of this technology.  It's not that a very patient society is bad for anyone in particular.  Patience backed by real advantage is quite healthy.  It's just that the system leadership must implicitly get a little more restrictive about who is considered important enough to influence the local economy... so the public is a bit disempowered if they aren't in or near the protection pole.
	9.  Narrative indicator:  This technology changes around the definitions of 'the public' somewhat, as it exalts a few people who wouldn't be VIPs in most systems.
	10.  Narrative indicator:  There isn't really reason to suspect that ZPE arrays intended to be used rarely and slowly would fall apart when the territory does.  Once society stops drawing on the ZPE arrays, they'll still remain out there in the deep black, patiently accumulating energy for a future administration to tap into.
	11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  I imagine the implementation of this technology involving the construction of a defensive bureaucracy to INTENTIONALLY make sure that everything which touches the Beyonder Engines is slowed down severely.  It's similar to the Stasis Controller downside, but worse because this requires more active intervention, and that intervention takes a form which is more malign to the basic normal functioning of a bureaucracy.  If the public isn't perfectly understanding, Beyonder Engines might promote the hatred of bureaucracy; imagine all the people ranting about how resources are being "wasted" just "sitting there" because the bureacrats and industrialists are "doing nothing"!
	12.  Utopic rating:  4/5
	13.  Public protection rating:  2/5, +1 in planned economies
	14.  Technological smoothness:  5/5
	15.  Technological extremophilia:  Unrateable.  Irrelevant!  This investment certainly does develop towards extremes... *ridiculously slowly*.
	16.  Kind of person most protected:  The top 1% most patient people in society, whether or not they have any other qualifications.
15.  Panarchic Courts
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  One of the services that the Panarchy provides is to flush planets with panarchic arbitrators.  The galactic arbitration service ostensibly exists to maximize access to judicial resources and fast-track society towards a fully consensual basis of law.  They dive into the disputes and legal ambiguities of the planet's society to find ways to bring people towards agreement.
	2.  Downside analysis:  The most charismatic lawyers in the galaxy are very charismatic indeed, and can blind the unwary.  Panarchic courts sometimes bind people to 'voluntary' agreements that they would rather not have gotten involved with.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic courts dramatically increase the exploitation of the planet's system of law, whatever it is.  That's exploitation in a negative sense, generally.  Whatever they're working with, they maximize and accelerate the public's utilization of it.  This produces a massive amount of data about the implication of the rules that the planet operates under.  This is the same kind of data that the Seats of Policy study, and there's even more of it when it's produced like this.
	4.  Downside analysis:  Exposing data through exploiting legalism does expose the same kind of data as is studied by the Commonwealth's Seats of Policy, but it does so in a markedly more stressful way.  It does it with less of the implied investment in travel logistics, too.  Societies that are well on their way to falling apart are pushed farther down the path to downfall as people agree to more of what they shouldn't along the whole vast frontier of bureaucratic error.  This is a major impairment to the utopic potential of the technology.  When galactic society learns more about the errors that the people of a particular planet are inclined to make, sometimes that means it's frustratingly obvious what's wrong with a territory long before it collapses.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  A well-developed system of panarchic law resembles a system of explicit social contract.  A web of formally defined relationships arises between the many different organizations in society.  Although some find that bewildering and chaotic, others find it beautiful and well-ordered.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic arbitrators defend their work as bringing society to a greater peace through voluntary social organization.  They argue that their arbitration networks and systems of explicit social contract are a key part of what makes the Panarchy functional as a consensual meta-organization.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Where societies have rights that are being poorly-served in their system, litigous panarchic arbitrators can compel governments to more fully commit to their own programs.  This is expensive, but lawyers and activists typically believe that making 'on paper' commitments into 'on the ground' realities is essential to creating a fully just system.  This greatly strengthens the public protection potential of the panarchic courts and increases their utopic potential.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Although the Commonwealth considers them a thorn in the side of progress, the panarchic arbitration networks fully believe in the justice and necessity of the services that they provide.  Like a lot of the Panarchic Ritualists, they're always looking for more qualifying immortals to join the galactic community, with a particular interest in developing judicial and administrative talent.  They disseminate the knowledge of the qualifications necessary for unlimited free movement privileges and territory-independent access to rejuvenation, and provide relevant training for individuals adjacent to their focii.  Since a lot of the work they do is for people who otherwise have poor access to judicial protections, their bias towards the preservation of legal talent is perhaps the only thing preventing them from being fully protective of the public.
	9.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  These courts accelerate the development of bureaucracies and pressure them to work more quickly towards the fulfilment of their ever-expanding obligations.  The ritualists defend this as an investment in the bureaucracies of tomorrow, but it makes the bureaucracies of today a good bit more miserable without making them much better at what they do.  The best work of the panarchic arbitrators has a place in paradise, but when systems start overloading, the panarchic courts develop a tendency to promote errors and intensify them.

16.  Three Shift Society
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Facially, this is one of the wonders of literalism in the game.  Increasing utilization of infrastructure during off-peak hours, and generally shifting peak demand to off-peak demand, *is* a way to increase efficiency and population density.  So what goes wrong?  Why is it so expensive?
	2.  Downside analysis:  Most people can't do this.  More of the public is stressed-out and insomniac as a result of spreading these schedules widely.  Resentment against the bureaucracy increases as a source of suffering is generated with an obvious cause.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  The three shift society inherently invests in the development (and population growth) of neurodivergent populations.  Diversity increases most directly as a result of favoring the otherwise disfavored minority of people who can keep these schedules comfortably, but it also increases indirectly as a result of cultural divergence according to the different schedule blocks.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  More people are capable of working productively with each other without conflict, even if they don't realize this is going on, because more of their vital coworkers are working on different schedules.  Not only does the density of population increase, but also the frequency with which people of divergent personalities are capable of productive interface.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  Global coordination improves as services centralized in different parts of the planet cease to "go dark" at night.  Despite an increased risk that you'll be dealing with insomniac support staff, global average service quality increases in customer support work (most notably tech support), and businesses or other organizations facing unexpected emergencies are more likely to be able to find competent help from their peers.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  24/7 public activity means 24/7 staffing of emergency services.  Emergency services ordinarily run with insomniacs at night; now they can run with excellent staff at night.  Fewer people die in disasters as a result, be those disasters personal or large.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  The homicide rate drops.  Firstly, this is because emergency services are better able to respond at night, but secondly for a more macabre reason.  Fewer people die "in broad daylight" than in times and places where there'll be no witnesses.  More of the hours of the day are "broad daylight" in this society, and swathes of the night no longer have people out of sight.
	8.  Downside analysis:  Night-time traffic disrupts sleep more.  Processes which were set to run "at night, when they won't get in the way" also have to schedule actual disruptions in order to operate.  For better and for worse, one of the ways that people can be out of each others' way is disrupted.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Independently of overall economic structure, government interventions in the economy increase as bureaucratic auditors start needing to measure how long *everything* takes.  All new processes face new regulatory compliance burdens.  This intervention by state planners is unobtrusive competency in planned economies (cybernetics research strengthens); in more stratified economies (even regulated economies), this magnifies the planned nature of the stratification.  Better data makes the government look more 'at fault' for inequality.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This is an extremely bureaucratic intervention, AND it promotes the hatred of bureaucracy.  Even though it does work by protecting the public and increasing public sector competency, people aren't likely to be grateful.

17.  Artificial Wombs
	1.  Authorial protest:  The description describes this as cloning en masse.  I don't believe it.  Ontogenic control is too dear to my heart, and I know very well that it wouldn't work as cloning en masse.  This is a technology that I would seriously consider revising if I were able to mod The Viceroy, since I don't think +1% population growth is at all the right thing for it to do.  That said, I do think it would increase populations...  Increasing the crowding limit would be a better effect for this to have.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The power to synthesize tissues is very substantially a medical technology.  It would make the promise of immortality considerably more real by providing substrates for experimentation and synthesis of medically necessary tissues.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  I see no reason not to admit that this would provide a food source.  Don't think "eating babies".  Think "eating cruelty free animal meats".  Think "muscle tissue that was never attached to a living animal".  Vegan-friendly actual chicken meat, because no chickens were harmed in the making of it.  Right now, synth-meat is super expensive.  Fully matured, this technology should enable urban food production to scale with urban populations.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Long-term, the ability to clone populations should provide a powerful influence over population genetics.  Rare and advantageous genomes can be replicated more easily and lost more rarely.  Population demographics can be adjusted for greater harmony, without having to cede an inch to bigotry to accomplish it.
	5.  Downside analysis:  The ability to clone populations is likely to intensify the errors of the government, whatever errors the government is making.  Whatever traits the government favors too much - and every government is likely to favor *something* more than it should - that trait will eventually become over-expressed in the population.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  Dysgenics should never *irreversibly* afflict a society that has artificial wombs, because a society that has artificial wombs should also therefore have the technology to reverse all dysgenic effects.  They have the genetic archives!  They have the ability to profile the implications of heritable traits in extraordinary detail.
	7.  Warning note:  There's a risk of bad epigenomics from the use of artificial wombs.  Clones don't *have* a natural epigenome.  They only have a simulated epigenome. Society's understanding of heritability would be tested by this technology.
	8.  Warning note:  Relatedly, this technology could amplify ALL heritability errors.  The society that has them is greatly empowered to fix heritability errors, but it can also make them much faster than a natural society could.  Genetic quality fluctuations are likely to occur at a faster-than-generational rate.  *On average*, genetic quality should increase, but that may not be the effect over any given interval.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  By providing test substrates for exotic genetic modifications, this technology should accelerate genetics research.  This is a morphological freedom technology, and even an animal uplift technology.  Society should grow radically more diverse as a result of implementing artificial wombs.
	11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  ...complicated.  The purity of this technology's bureaucratism is the average purity of the government implementing it.  Maybe a bit better than that, because the system itself provides genetic archives that will be functionally protective of talent, and because the system's own literally employed talents should be insulated from the hatred of bureaucracy.  Even if someone seizes a cloning lab, they're only likely to hurt the scientists operating it if they have a pure hatred of cloning labs as such, and every technology intrinsically implies the protection of itself against such direct oppositions.
	12.  Utopic rating:  This technology's utopic rating is the same as the average utopic rating of the territory plus one, maximum 5/5.
	13.  Public protection rating:  This technology's public protection rating is the same as the average public protection rating of the territory.
	14.  Technological smoothness:  2/5  (No low tech analogue.)

18.  Holistic Industrialization
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The most simple, literal technology in the tech tree.  Hire people who study district specialties and connect the district's industry to the needs of the broader economy.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Deeply boring managers with gentle voices...
	3.  Narrative indicator:  As holistic industrialization spreads through a territory, productive industrial centralization increases bit by bit, linking small artisans together into the service of a larger whole.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  Unions get founded and expand in the territory, too.  Work stoppages and peaceful resistance become more probable as people become aware of the resources of the broader economy, and how they could potentially organize to claim a greater share of them.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  You could do this productively at ANY technology level.  It says NOTHING about what technologies are being implemented.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Literal.  Very literal.  It's just a bureaucratic technology.  Even union work stoppages are a form of literal bureaucratic waste.
	7.  Utopic rating:  This is the original 5/5 utopic tech.  It might still be a mistake, but it's never worse than wasteful.  Trying to do this is virtuous!
	8.  Public protection rating:  5/5
	9.  Technological smoothness:  5/5
	10.  Technological extremophilia:  3/5
	11.  Kind of person most protected:  Serene industrialists... which in *this* setting means *Imperials*!  Even though this is a Commonwealth tech very far away from Imperial thought, this *always* best protects Imperials!
19.  Palace of the Arts
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  When the description talks about the palaces as though they were a single structure each, it's obviously talking about a general pattern of a kind of structures.  In this case, mega-museums oriented towards commercialization of local culture.
	2.  Downside analysis:  These structures try to unify, codify, and centralize the artistic traditions of the district.  It's similar to the intention of holistic industrialization, but applying this attitude to culture is considerably less virtuous than applying this attitude to industry.  Artisans working with industrial goods know they're working with commodities and they're proud of the commodities they work with.  Artisans working with cultural goods are much less likely to be happy about getting their work commodified.
	3.  Apologia:  In modest quantities, there's probably nothing wrong with these...  The first few such palaces built in a territory are surely magnificent and helpful to the artists in the territory.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Consumer orientation is not entirely wrong.  Palaces of the Arts turn the culture of their area towards the public's interests.  The particular pattern of cultural development that they promote better represents what the public believes in and is willing to expend resources on.  Well-entrenched local dissidents are not squelched by this.
	5.  Downside analysis:  Since they codify and produce "correct" understandings of local culture, very small local dissident groups (individuals and small groups) may find that they're squeezed out by the "correct" understanding of local culture.  This technology gets less utopic as the territory gets more crowded.
	6.  Apologia:  While the people who get excluded by this tech probably will try to overthrow society, they're particularly unlikely to do so violently.  The intensity of 'collapse' events may therefore be moderated by the presence of palaces of the arts.  In other words: slower, less violent, more survivable collapses.  This synergizes well with open border policies: more opportunity to see disaster coming and more opportunity to leave early.
	7.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Depressingly non-literal.  Running commercial culture complexes is not a bureaucratically expensive endeavor.  It's largely self-funding.  Yet I agree that this 'technology' would promote 'bureaucratic waste', because I think it would promote public intransigence.  Peaceful resistance, civil unrest, depression in the public... even boredom and revulsion, because codified commercial culture takes few risks and is more likely to adopt an ugly attitude for controversy than an incisive one.

20.  Panarchic War Memorials
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic war memorials train pacifists and warmongers to be indistinguishable from each other.  They're an educational investment in making deeply peaceful people indistinguishable as much as possible from deeply violent people.
	2.  Downside analysis:  Who would *do* that?  This is likely to see people fixate on "If we can't tell peaceful people from murderers, won't the murder rate rise?"  After all, 'everyone knows' that a great mass of infiltrating potential soldiers is a lethal hazard!  There could be violent people hiding ANYWHERE!
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  On average, the concern about warriors in hiding is an error.  Not only are most people inclined towards peace, most people who believe that violence is acceptable for *some* reason do not believe that violence is acceptable for *any* reason.  Furthermore, a consistent inclination towards war is a rare thing that becomes *less* acceptable as panarchic war memorials spread, because society begins to expect that people are capable of understanding both sides of conflicts.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Teaching people the ways of peace and war is fundamentally rehabilitative.  It inclines people to be respectful of each other across a classification of social divides where violence and disrespect are often linked, and it achieves that respect without demeaning pacifism.  Encouraging respectful discussion about the causes of conflict gives people more opportunity to be forgiven when they wish to come clean about their misdeeds and turn their backs on them.  Society gets broader.
	6.  Downside analysis:  Even if the headline fear of murderers is wrong, the social stress of knowing that this is *being done* is probably not fun.  People will use it to mistreat each other.  Think cannibal humor and genocidal fictions.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  At a large-scale, public recognition that war is politics by other means may encourage scary political deliberations... but it will also tend to expose those deliberations, and to encourage negotiations.
	8.  Narrative indicator:  On average, pacifism rises, but it becomes more unequally distributed.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  The Panarchy doesn't approve of warring nations, because it doesn't approve of *territorial authorities*.  The many overlapping governments of the Panarchy are non-territorial entities.  When it pushes talent into a zone, it tries to erode systems of territorial control, and to persuade people to abandon territorial exclusivity in leadership.  The borders don't open... they dissolve, leaving people where they are.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  I can't really evaluate this.  I've written all that I've just written... and I don't know what the actual mechanism is.  I believe I know what this technology *attempts* to accomplish, but I don't know how that thing can be achieved.  It's not that it's beyond my ideological range, either...  I just... don't know how it can be done.

21.  Eternal Bank Tower
	1.  Mechanism Proposal:  If someone wants to spend their whole life wonking out about banking regulations, that makes no sense from a conventional time-bound perspective; they end up spending absurd amounts of time contemplating wholly theoretical considerations with little or no real-world applicability.  Yet they often *can* improve on the quality of banking regulations... *semi*-permanently.  Every new regulatory scheme in banking is eventually exploited beyond all reason or usefulness, but with sufficient administrative talent backing it that can take a long time.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The Old Empire is probably lying about having access to atemporal intelligences... but they're not lying about having access to people who love totally abstract financial matters that are *beyond* most people.
	3.  Downside analysis:  Economic inequality is likely to rise.  It's not certain to rise, but society's equality levels become more dependent on the charity of people with massive financial resources, so it's likely that society becomes more financially unequal.  The average person becomes more economically powerless.  This technology does *not* protect irrelevant people, or perhaps better said it only *temporarily* protects irrelevant people.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  The Old Empire is extensively willing to trust people to tamper with regulations and they are willing to contest the quality of regulations past and future.  The key phrase in that sentence was "extensively willing to trust".
	5.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Fairly literal.  Staying ahead of regulatory exploitation is an administrative challenge.  However, it loses points for being a *hostile* regulatory challenge, as there will be more people actively trying to defang or derange the regulatory authority, and the system is thus more likely to fall into a dystopic state.
	6.  Utopic Rating:  3/5, +1 in Planned Economies, -1 in Feudal Economies
	7.  Public Protection Rating:  1/5, +1 in Regulated or Planned Economies
	8.  Technological smoothness:  2/5

2021-3-31; I feel generally scared and/or angry at trying to ideologically analyze the Imperial technologies, which strike me as rotten with unspoken dependencies and/or outright lies, even though I can see that there's also some measure of brilliance and worth down there if I'd a greater mastery of the game to use it with.

2021-4-20; I'm feeling better about these, although I still don't feel competent with them.  I still get the sense that the more you develop the technology of the setting, the more *literal* Imperial technologies get...  Frictionless Highways exemplify this sense, as that looks to me like it refers not to its literally described technology so much as to a kind of person who thrives at many possible technology levels while contributing to the serene industrialism of the Empire in any of them.  In a low-tech society, this guy loves racehorses...  Maybe this guy still loves racehorses when he's got cat-ear antennae in a cyberized society, too.

2021-4-26; The Panarchy Ritualists say that the forms of the overlapping governments are more important than their functions, right?  That seems calculated to induce horror.  How can someone prefer form over function!?  Right?  Well, what if they aren't talking about aesthetics at all, but they mean the *bureaucratic* forms?  They could be expressing frustration that the other subcultures don't do enough to protect people who fill out paperwork correctly.

2021-5-12; I'm extremely reluctant to record what I think the Prenatal Education technology refers to in the above list, but I'm planning to list its "Kind of person most protected:" as "people whose genetic potential for intelligence is extremely resistant to abuse".  Note that the basic instinctual grasp of math and language which prenatal education cites is *the exact same thing* that the Lyceum relies upon among the Panarchy, and the Panarchy puts that stuff up near the AI collectives while the Commonwealth squelches it down under nationalism.  Furthermore, while the Panarchy is denigrated as supposedly producing incomprehensibility thereby, we're supposed to expect that the reproduce-or-else natalism of the Commonwealth is virtuous with the same stuff.  It looks more to me like "Prenatal Education" refers to "with enough effort, we can rehabilitate some of the people who our other technologies victimize"...  It's like...  if you weren't being natalists, you could get *that* technological advantage just by listening to people and working harder to include them in society (as does the Lyceum on the opposite side of the tech graph).

2021-5-15; I'm considering adding a "thrill" rating to the technology interpretations.  This would estimate the degree to which the technology favors people who are boredom-prone or boredom-resistant.  I can probably rate this on a 1-to-5 scale as well, but I'm not sure which way to scale it.  The obvious answer would be for 5/5 to be maximally thrilling, but honestly my own bias is to make 5/5 a technology that favors people maximally resistant to boredom.  Society needs some of the boredom-prone, but they're also risky; people who are not at all prone to getting bored are safer though often less novel (none of the science technologies would be 5/5 except maybe ancestral recording).  Also, something that makes me unsure about including this is that different factions have different vulnerabilities to the boredom-prone.  The Commonwealth strikes me as least endangered by mixing boring and anti-boring people (I can give it that), whereas I imagine that the serenity-valuing Imperials are considerably threatened by their own boredom-prone inclusions.  The Panarchy is somewhere in between.

2021-5-19; Studying the tech graph, it looked to me like there's an axis of trust-focused technological development (which includes most of the metatechnological development) and an axis of virtue-focused technological development.  It also looked like there was a singular intellect vs general intellect axis such that the Empire favors developing the capabilities of common intellects, whereas the Commonwealth and the Panarchy both favor developing the capabilities of extreme intellects.  When I was contemplating these axes, I looked with some confusion on the horizontal range.  It seemed like there should be an axis across the middle as well, but I couldn't tell what it was.  War?  Chaos?  I've thought about it since, and I think the answer is Diversity vs Homogeneity.  The Panarchy favors diversity; it embraces risky dehomogenation of the galaxy's technology base.  The Commonwealth favors homogeneity; it favors breeding nationalists!  This maps to the Imperial side as well; the Panarchy's side of this postulated Diversity<->Homogeneity axis are the Orbital Surveyors, who re-engineer ecosystems to maximize (eco-)sustainable development, whereas the Commonwealth's side of this Diversity<->Homogeneity axis are the Old Empire, whose belief in mental unity is conceptually similar to (and to my mind has similar hazards to) the Commonwealth's promotion of nationalistic indoctrination.

2021-5-21; Likely to be towards the end of the list before I get Vacuum-Based Life reviewed, or else it'll see a lot of updates.  That is a very heavy investment in morphological alteration.  Definitely one of the uplift techs.  Strange implications though, as I think some of the biological productivity boost from Vacuum-Based Life is due to the way that having that much biological control permits redesigning metabolisms.  I think it may be possible to supply both oxygen and nutrients via fluid injection, for instance, and such may be the 'fuel' of a vacuum-based life form.

2021-5-22; I know why Prenatal Education upsets me so much.  It's the sheer presumption.  If I reach for the brightest potential and assume that the technology is being implemented by saints, it's still being implemented by people who assume that **their own** sex life proves that **their children** are willing to live under similar conditions.  It's still being implemented by people who are assuming that they know the mind of the unborn, precognitively.  If they're right, that makes them more effective, but that's an 'if'!  If they're wrong, then they're miring the unborn in circumstances beyond their control.  And I'm really extra bothered by seeing this show up near nationalism and natalism, because it's like...  The natalist presumption that the unborn are always going to be interested in sex is horrifying.  Not only has humanity always had a substantial rate of people who don't want sex and shouldn't be forced into it, even people who *are* interested in sex should not have that presumed of them.  It's rape culture.  This tech is frankly less terrifying if it gets implemented after panarchic cognitechnologies, because then there are nanotech interfaces involved to take away the precognitive aspect.

2021-5-24; Some of these technologies give me an impression of offering a smooth gradient across different "tech levels".  Holistic industrialization (for instance) never really goes obsolete and doesn't really have prerequisites.  Instead of requiring specific tools or methods in society, it requires the existence of a particular kind of mind, and it's fairly straightforward to imagine that mind adapting in the use of a wide range of technologies.  The Imperial technology of Distributed Intelligence offers an even more extreme form of the same thing, because a society that believes strongly "of course everyone is thinking, they're all capable of being smart" (even if sometimes they're not) *would* have scientific advantages at low tech levels, and the same inclination would then lead (at higher tech levels) towards serious investments in extending technological assistance across the whole population.  So it's the same population and the same motive force, but it leads to a radical progression when you consider it across increasingly advanced technology levels.  I could possibly come up with some kind of ratings for...  technological smoothness and extremophilia?  To contrast, Eternal Bank Towers sort of presume your society builds towards a certain level of economic sophistication, but they don't imply a continuous progression and they don't suggest any particular pattern of extremeophilic development, so they'd have a low rating on both smoothness and extremophilia.

2021-5-25;  I'm not looking forward to eventually doing a write-up on Jaunting Grids.  How do I interpret that..?  I have some ideas for what it means at extreme tech levels, but I feel like I should come up with at least one low-tech analogue explanation for it.  Preferably two.  Thinking about what someone could be referring to non-literally with that technology's description makes my head hurt.

2021-5-26;  I'm also not looking forward to eventually doing a write-up on Creche Education.  My public school experiences suuuucked and contributed in big ways to the vast majority of the most messed up interactions I ever had with anyone.  Twenty years ago in school I was taught what The Viceroy teaches about Wealth: that it's really *actually* a method of achieving reproductive success.  It disturbs me to see Crech Education listed as a perpetual ideological component *of an immortal society*.  I would hack that and modify it.  Seriously, I want to hook some kind of debugger to The Viceroy and create a modified tech tree for it.  It's so *almost*.  This game is amazingly *almost*.  I don't even have to protest its "everything falls apart eventually" schtick; it's a good gameplay mechanic and definitely thought-provoking.

The Much-Reviled Lower Classes

The same ideology at different levels may substantially change its moral valence and the implications about how a society is governed.  Thinking about the six factions and how they change their constituent population demographics strikes me as salient here.  If I remember correctly (I'm not presently loading the game to check), Wealth 6 is described as 'galactic average', and at Wealth 6, the population is 2/5ths upper class, 2/5ths middle class, and 1/5th lower class.

Each faction is defined by a specific 'ascension' pattern.  For instance, the Panarchy Ritualists turn Commonwealth citizens into Imperial citizens, then they turn Imperial citizens into Panarchists.  This is the inverse of the Commonwealth Unifiers, who turn Panarchists into Imperial citizens, and then into Commonwealth citizens.  As Wealth increases, the ascension pattern moves.  (Also, population growth increases, which is *bogus*; primitive impoverished societies should have exuberant population growth bonuses checked by very low carrying capacities, so that they are constantly overcrowded, whereas advanced and wealthy societies should have increasing carrying capacities yet impaired population growth, such that they tend to undercrowd and benefit from efforts to increase their populations.)

When you pick up a territory, it has mostly collapsed, and it is mostly comprised of the failures of another faction.  In The Viceroy, you are *always* taking over the failed territories of your enemies, and you're always fighting a rebellion from your lower class.  (You are *also* always governing on *behalf of* that rebellion; canonically, you always close out assignments by giving the redeveloped territory *back*!  (This is why I like not killing rebels!!))  At the start of each assignment, the population is 4-5ths lower class, and at that level it may or may not be able to manage a decent modern sewage system, let alone a galactic society.

Since the *violent* conflicts between the factions are focused on the lower classes, each faction presumably most hates the lower classes of their opposing faction most.  So the Commonwealth Unifiers loathe the Panarchy because of what the Panarchic lower class is like, and the Panarchic Ritualists loathe the Commonwealth because of what the Commonwealth lower class is like.

The game doesn't give us too much hatred from which to demonize the lower classes, and I'm glad of that; The Viceroy has a gentle touch in some of the ways that matter.  Still, we get some clue about what the lower classes of the Commonwealth are like when the Panarchic Ritualists decry the 'authoritarianism' of the Commonwealth.  Look at the Commonwealth Unifier tech tree (upper right), and then imagine that ideology if it were being espoused by people who thought the best two techs on the tree were Reproductive Mandate and Nationalist Indoctrination.  I think that's what the Panarchy Ritualists rankle against: the worst people in the Commonwealth, the ruiners and eaters of the Commonwealth territories, are sexually-obsessed singers of praise to dear leader who think that people should be literally punished if they don't have enough sex.

What would the other examples be like?  If I can come up with at least one more, I'll reorganize this information into a section analogous to the Six Subcultures section for describing the Three Lower Classes.

The Much-Reviled Upper Classes

Contrasting the reviled lower classes, it's worth noting that the territories dominated by the *upper classes* tend to be wildly wasteful and ungovernable, which suggests that the upper classes are more pleasant and technophilic yet not really more productive than the lower classes.  Then, the middle class of each faction should be its general locus of virtue; in the Commonwealth Unifiers and the Panarchic Ritualists alike, the Imperials are unusually virtuous people!  Whereas in the territories governed by the Commonwealth Consensus and the Old Empire, you have unusually virtuous Panarchists, and in the territories of the Panarchic Informalists and the Imperial Reformers, you would get unusually virtuous admirers of the Commonwealth.

2021-5-20;  Notably, in *this* game, unlike any society IRL, the "upper classes" appear to be the people who have insane numbers of kids and very little interest in doing anything except reproducing.  So it's like they're animals being empowered by automated systems - different variations of post-sapient homo fecundus, having given up meaning in life in favor of nihilistic reproductionism.  Suggesting that they're easily destroyed by the lower and middle classes of other factions, who will have unusually strong inclinations to do exactly that, while the middle and lower classes of their own faction will be unusually inclined to stand back and let their overpopulated "upper class" get scorched off...  If there's a few members of the upper class, their upper classness is more likely credible.  So that's at what, 5 Wealth?  6 Wealth?  More than that and the "upper class" stops looking much like a recognizable upper class given the way this game models population dynamics.  And, given that *I* treat stable immortals as people who are disinterested in reproduction, the Wealth multiplier on Influence suggests that these people are the very worst parents in the game, and they all tend to make reproduction look *awful*, so that the smarter people born into these societies are frequently socialized in a way that makes them suitable for the (more sustainable) galactic society that doesn't just breed constantly like homo fecundus.

2021-5-20;  Since I'm very unsure about my thoughts on this, I'm going to switch to a dated version of these posts going forward.  This game gets kind of maximally weird at high Wealth.  I think it'd be a more appealing vision if it had a more complex algorithm for Wealth's effect on population, representing that increasingly wealthy populations can sustain larger populations (multiplying carrying capacity), but are increasingly averse to doing so (multiplying crowding sensitivity), such that Wealth should increase population slowly rather than starkly, then eventually start to reduce it again when crowding oversensitization becomes the predominant impact.  This would make the technologies that increase crowding limits relatively more important, which I think would be appropriate; if you want to make a very Wealthy population reproduce, give them some celestial mansions in orbit.  On Earth, we see wildly overcrowded conditions where people are constantly having kids existing where people are most IMPOVERISHED, suggesting that low Wealth should increase population growth but narrow carrying capacities, so that the result is a miserably crowded society which actually gets more space to breathe as it gets Wealthier.

2021-5-20;  If I think about this long enough, I'm going to start producing predictive modeling algorithms for how I think it should work.  My mind has glanced off speculative population modeling algorithms a few times as I've played this game, and even though such algorithms are uniformly constructed in disagreement with the simple, disturbing algorithm in The Viceroy, thinking about them has been a reward of playing.  If I keep refining my strategies in game slowly over a long period of time, maybe I'll come up with something more clever than the game itself.
