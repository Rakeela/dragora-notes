# Ideological Interpretations of The Viceroy

Presented in the game's lore are the six subcultural ideologies, the three overarching ideologies, and the implicit subdivisions in the technology graph.  Thoughts on the social dynamics implied by the choices and the collections of the choices seem like one of the core aspects going on in the narratives that are told within the game by the game's mechanics.

The Six Subcultures
 - The Old Empire -
The humans most like Beyonders summoned the Beyonders most like humans, creating the Empire of the Elect.  This fraction of the Old Empire is serene because they know that the time cost of each action is illusory.  They're happy to jaunt around *being* the fungible population, doing esoteric tasks for the amusement of distant strangers on other worlds, trusting that enough will get done fast enough if people just keep working without worrying about it.
Velocity is only a matter of perspective; slow and steady work may even get the work done faster.  Immortality does these people a great service.
