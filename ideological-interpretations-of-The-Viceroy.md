# Ideological Interpretations of The Viceroy

Presented in the game's lore are the six subcultural ideologies, the three overarching ideologies, and the implicit subdivisions in the technology graph.  Thoughts on the social dynamics implied by the choices and the collections of the choices seem like one of the core aspects going on in the narratives that are told within the game by the game's mechanics.

---
The Six Subcultures
 - The Old Empire -
	 - The Rundown
		 - The humans most like Beyonders summoned the Beyonders most like humans, creating the Empire of the Elect.  This fraction of the Old Empire is serene because they know that the time cost of each action is illusory.  They're happy to jaunt around *being* the fungible population, doing esoteric tasks for the amusement of distant strangers on other worlds, trusting that enough will get done fast enough if people just keep working without worrying about it.
	 - The Value of Immortality
		 - Velocity is only a matter of perspective; slow and steady work may even get the work done faster.  Immortality does these people a great service.
	 - The View on Collapse
		 - The Old Empire holds the burning world in its hands.  That's an important symbol for them.  Yes, galactic society is always collapsing, and yes that means the empire is always collapsing.  The old empire is aware that they are infinitely declining forever.  They call that acknowledging entropy, and they only worry about it day to day to the extent that doing so is part of their dayjob.
	 - The Stereotype
		 - Placid, but occasionally surprising.
	 - The Rebellion (Commonwealth)

 - The Reformed Empire -
		 - The Rundown
			 - Serenity in motion, and an occasionally vile sense of humor.  An active opposition to anything that doesn't seem like a productive endeavor, combined with a will to prey on labor opportunities, off-load their challenges, exaggerate their accomplishments, and look for opportunities to coast.  Are they productive on average?  Somehow, yes.
		 - The Value of Immortality
			 - Well, they're happy to be alive.  They're not always good for everyone else's happiness, but they are themselves happy in all kinds of conditions.  They can be lured into a lot of ugly work while only moderately overpaying them, and if the blast radius is small enough...  Ugh...  Immortality does these people a great service.
		 - The View on Collapse
			 - The Reformed Empire is on fire, and it can't tell the difference between going down and going faster.  If the Empire falls, it needed to fall.  If something new rises after, great!  If the Empire itself rises after, great!  If the Empire somehow doesn't even fall?  Great!  As long as the Empire keeps MOVING and DOING STUFF, the Empire is Great!
		 - The Stereotype
			 - Strong, ambitious, and heavily tattooed.
		 - The Rebellion (Panarchic)
 
 - The Monocultural Commonwealth - 
	 - The Rundown
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 -  The Stereotype
	 - The Rebellion (Panarchic)

 - The Commonwealth "Democracy"
	 - The Rundown
		 - They completely reject serenity, despite which they want to have MANY kids, a determination that they're willing to enforce with the authority of the government.  As they're willing to enforce everything else with the authority of the government.  If left to run completely unchecked, they install all-monitoring omnipresent surveillance, and god save you if they catch you being unhappy about it.  Unhappy people might be *serial killers*.
		 - Their society has a problem with would-be serial killers for some reason.  It has a problem with occasional suicidal violence.  The loyal members of the Commonwealth know that if they were to loosen their grasp, the consequences would be *terrible*.  Yet nobody knows what's wrong.  Don't they work *so tirelessly* to make people happy?
		 - They consider themselves the antidote to corruption even as they admit that their society is also corrupt.  God save you if you get on the wrong side of *their* criminals, because *their* criminals exist on the empowered side of their surveillance grid. Anyone who opposes the Commonwealth's criminals is clearly a criminal themselves.  The omnipresent surveillance grid can prove it!
		 - They talk about rehabilitation, but their system of omnipresent surveillance doesn't *talk* about itself.  It doesn't operate openly, since that would result in it being successfully evaded.  Very rarely does it directly challenge people on what they did wrong.  It just treats people as presumptive criminals who better be superheroes if they want to survive.  Their court system is persistently underprovisioned, prone to passing sentences on people who never got a chance, and their society is forever building new city-prisons to deal with the consequences of their ideology.
		 - They do all this and they consider themselves the *only* scientific subculture, except *maybe*, very reluctantly, the Panarchic Informalists.  Everyone else is some kind of primitive subsapient parrot who never thinks of anything new.
		 - All this, and they're the most fun society!  The purpose to life is to be happy!  Lets throw a party!  Can't you just feel the absolute liberation?  Big sister only clenches her fist because you *enjoy* it!
		 - Oh, and they plan out their kids' lives before they're born.  Knowing the minds of people who haven't been born yet is just another part of their sciences.  Can't you just imagine the joyous childhoods of kids born to parents who reject serenity, always want to have fun, *and* believe that they deserve absolute control?  You better imagine a lot of that, because these people have lots of kids.  They think mandatory reproduction is a really good thing.
		 - Finally, they're great farmers, but they hate industrial farming.  They don't want to be agricultural specialists and they're embarrassed to work on agritechnologies.  There are as a result three kinds of happy Commonwealth farmers: pioneers working on developing planets with inadequate infrastructure, artisan farmers growing small luxury crops, and artsy farmers who also make a bunch of arts and crafts to sell on the side.
	 - The Value of Immortality
		 - If it weren't for the ethical issues of farming prison planets to extract a few people who an all-powerful corrupted surveillance grid decides are virtuous, I'd be enthusiastic about the Commonwealth Consensus.  The problem is that the sociopaths who run their subculture try to reject immortality for almost everyone.  They build massive populations to extract marginal numbers of saints, while wishing death on everyone else.
		 - Some of these people are good cops, but not as many of them as think of themselves as good cops. Some of these people are good scientists, but not as many of them as think of themselves as good scientists.  Some of these people are really fun, but not as many as think of themselves as really fun.  A lot of these people are discarded as disappointments, and their "extremely happy" society suffers from outbreaks of suicidal violence courtesy of its rejectees.
		 - The people who do survive all of this are absolute gems, and immortality does them a great service.  But at what cost?
	 - The View on Collapse
		 - The Commonwealth Consensus doesn't collapse!  They think that the fall of their system of government would be the fall of society forever.  So it... doesn't fall.  Supposedly.  It just sort of slumps.  A lot.  They cling together and shuttle talent around.  I mean sure, the afterparty can be a drain, but things always get going again.
	 -  The Stereotype
		 -  Smart happy blood cultists doing what their parents told them.  If they can.  While they can.  Holding up all of galactic society as the only civilized people.  So *happy*.
	 - The Rebellion (Imperial)
		 - Bigoted!  They're bigoted!  They put together entire planets of nationalist-indoctrinated bigots "for cultural reasons", and since they'd rather export luxury goods than grow industrial crops, they often layer in panarchic indoctrination too.  They then proceed to wonder why a population that has been stressed since childhood to perform cultural displays of nationalist ambition is riven with hatreds!  Why are we trying to farm the rare saints of bigotry!?  Concentrating hatred this much is awful!
		 - What about people who find slowing down and taking their time to be PART of having fun?  What about the quiet people?  People who don't enjoy life the same way the Commonwealth Consensus enjoys life are unpersoned in these territories.  The exact approved form of fun varies from district to district, but their *kindly* and *virtuous* surveillance system tries *so hard* to make sure you're *always having fun*... or else.  Eeeegh.
		 - They have bad boundaries!  They protect the happiness of people who are comfortable with being prejudicially labeled criminals and then periodically "rehabilitated".  The reason these people can't solve murderous district conflicts is because they don't even want to stop petty jackassery around the fringes of small communities.  "Oh, you know, everyone makes mistakes."  Or worse, the collective-voiced "X will be X" arguments that exonerate entire classes for hurting others, justifying only the mildest punishments.
		 - A lot of these people are a lot more immortal than you'd think despite their society's official reluctance to offer mass immortality, because they take advantage of the open borders that the Commonwealth promotes to travel to wherever is offering rejuvenation services with the fewest strings attached.  Some of those demi-immortals are brazen crooks who just cooperate with cops to be "rehabilitated"... since everyone is a criminal anyways... and that's not supposed to be a reason for hatred in the Commonwealth.  Trying to deal with those is one of the reasons why Imperial provinces occasionally reinstate the death penalty!
		 - Oh, and despite the fact that mandatory reproduction leads to plummeting childcare quality, they think anyone who hates anything in their society is an evil monster who victimizes kids.  The Commonwealth are *the virtuous people*.  Imagine parents who are *so virtuous* ... and so, so willing to violate boundaries to make sure you're not *secretly a criminal*...  If they would loosen their grip and be more accepting of asexuality, they wouldn't need sacred omnipotence and the destruction of all boundaries to keep parenting standards high.
		 - They do the Panarchic thing of being obsessed with influencing people, which they combine with their total panopticon strategy.  So if you get on the wrong side of them, they use their massive power advantage to find everything embarrassing about you and make sure you get caught for everything.  But they do this while *underprovisioning their courts* and *not admitting to what they see*...  If you molest a kid in the Commonwealth, they use all these tools to make sure nothing you do is ever important, which is great.  The problem is, if the people who are on the privileged side of the glass molest a kid, *the same influence conspiracies destroy the kid*.
		 - They're even willing to use Panarchic subconscious education systems to harass people, which isn't against their law.  It's officially something nobody ever does.  That has resulted in the Panarchy's dream reeve programs being ubiquitously corrupted, since the Commonwealth's "system of law" *relies* on them being corrupted.  The Commonwealth Consensus uses its massive investments in authoritarian control to hamper all investigations into misuse of dream technologies.
		 - Even liking the leisures they offer too much is dangerous.  Their system of total control authorizes people in totally safe positions who never have to face appeals (the underprovisioned courts wouldn't see an appeal in a century if they were legally offered, which they AREN'T) to judge other people on their contributions to society.  This is one of the ways that people who were sexually abused get destroyed by their society.  The people who are fleeing trauma don't get the medical help they need, and if they aren't suitable DNA donors for Commonwealth natalists, they're eventually deemed unproductive.  Too expensive.  *Parasitic*.
		 - The same thing that happens to sexual abuse victims in the Commonwealth Consensus can happen to people who suffer workplace injuries in this society.  The problem is that the Commonwealth doesn't heavily provision the courts *or* the hospitals, and they think medical care is only for increasing population growth.  You see, they don't believe that good health makes people *happy*.  So if you have expensive medical needs... well, you'd better have made enough "contributions to society" to get a good enough pension.  Oh, and you'd better be able to use that pension to completely and totally heal yourself... before it runs out because you get judged to no longer be contributing to society...  in a society that underprovisions medicine and believes in withholding life extension treatments... good luck, sucker!
		 - The equal rights of people in this society are a complete sham.  They install vast systems of control to guarantee "equality"... and then they watch *everything* to control everything according to the influence of their ideology.  No single person can resist that if they fall afoul of it.  If you're nobody in this society, you may as well just die.  *That* is why they have so many would-be killers that they have to control.  That's why this society is laced tight with hatred.

 - The Panarchic Purist-Preservationists - 
	 - The Rundown
		 - They're boring.  They invent procedures and try to use them the same way every time.  They're also chaotic.  They catalogue procedures from across the galaxy and switch between them unpredictably.  They do this to study bureaucracy itself.  Forever.
		 - The Panarchic Purist-Preservationists, aka the Ritualists, believe that every government which ever existed had at least one good idea.  They're trying to find and update those ideas in both past and present governing structures.
		 - They lean towards serenity, but are somewhat averse to unity.  This leads to a society of many societies, constantly splintering and reforming as it invents new titles and new excuses for ceremony.  This is Panarchic multi-governance as administrated by the Ritualists, who do it most purely of Panarchists.
		 - They enjoy recreational simulations, and not in the video gaming sense.  Whole societies of Panarchic Purist-Preservationists sometimes get involved in recreational simulations.  They recreate dead systems of government and ancient cultures just because they want to.  Many of the practical governing structures of the Panarchy were originally created for recreational reasons with real world productivity ocurring only as an incidental side effect, much to the frustration of non-Panarchists who find themselves referring to the authority of people who were just setting something up on a whim a few centuries ago.
		 - One of the things that drives them towards automation research is that it lets them automate away labor tasks so that they can spend more time doing what they find fun.  Which just happens to be stuff that other people find BORING.
		 - Since they only get hung up on status issues *for fun*, they're actually really respectful to the staff.  That makes them both popular among service workers and a population happy to *be* respectful service workers themselves.  The waiter serving hors d'oeuvres today might be a famous Panarch somewhere else in a different organization.  When everything is going ideally, the waiters and the maidstaff are *also* a part of the majestic ritual.
		 - Military simulations are typically also included under the ritualist historic recreations, as are nastier things still.  An amazing number of people will consent to being whipped in a slave roleplay if it happens only in a negotiated manner, and it's no secret that the best warriors tend to keep a cool head.
		 - Some of these people cry for compassion and believe that the Commonwealth is too insistent on driving misery out of society.  Others deeply value happiness as a means of improving influence, which is to say the love of immortality itself.  Defining influence as the love of immortality reveals what the Panarchy Ritualists value most.
	 - The Value of Immortality
		 - The Panarchy thinks that everyone should be immortal.  Everyone's eternal paradise exists somewhere in their galactic simulations.  Needless to say, immortality does them a great service.
		 - These guys are amazing for the value of immortality!  Influence structures argue constantly for making more people immortal.  They reach through every level of every society trying to make more people immortal.  They are downright chaotic in their defenses of immortalizing people, and when they fail at doing it medically, they grieve through all the cultural power they can bring to bear.
	 - The View on Collapse
		 - Everyone makes mistakes.  What's important is filing good post mortems, documenting your errors exhaustively, and making *different* mistakes next time.  Madness is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results, but the Panarchy doesn't do that.
		 - Panarchialization Policies, especially when implemented by the Ritualists themselves, exemplify the Ritualists' dedication to policy diversification.  What exactly do Panarchialization Policies mean?  That is different literally everywhere that implements them.  They are a sincere attempt to try bright, wonderful, and *different* things in policy... in every district of every system of every territory.  They're highly questionable investments that conflict with each other *inevitably*, but they're not militant.  They're diverse, accepting, and inclusive.  They also accelerate the rate at which things fall apart and/or territories become ungovernable seekers of independence.  The Panarchy documents these things exhaustively and works to be less wrong with every iteration.
	 - The Stereotype
		 - "Certified only by recreational governance societies and holding aristocratic ranks in three different countries possessing no territorial holdings between them, we are to believe this person is a credible sociological force with vast insight into society."
		 - "Three thousand years of filing paperwork for fun has made this person a lynchpin in five different local governments, three of which she's never set foot in, and one of which she only visited when they set up expensive recreational facilities."
		 - "Why are we supposed to believe that they've found five thousand people who want to be checkout clerks FOREVER in this district?!  That doesn't happen!"
	 - The Rebellion (Commonwealth)
		 - Misfiled paperwork gets people *killed* in the societies that the Panarchic Ritualists govern.  Not executed, but given bad orders and improper provisioning.  Metaphorical deaths from this exceed literal deaths from this, but literal deaths have been documented to occur.
		 - People who believe in Panarchic simulated governments when they're not real embarrass themselves or worse.  People who fail to believe in Panarchic omni-governments when they ARE real embarrass themselves or worse!  People who fail to believe in Panarchic simulated governments that *weren't* real until they decided to do something VERY real... are normal!  That's normal!  Not expecting the fake government to do a real thing is normal.  Why do the Ritualists ENJOY when that happens?  Why aren't they embarrassed when people wearing plastic crowns start taking positions of actual authority?
		 - They're boring AND chaotic!  That's awful!  At least OUR chaos is FUN chaos!
		 - They're crazy gambling leaders.  They do stupid things with the government just because they can think of some excuse for why their latest stupid idea *might* have a good effect.  They then proceed to exhaustively record their own stupidity, typically revealing things we already knew.  They expect us to believe that this practice results in long-term gains in governance quality.
		 - They join our organizations and *break* them, either by leaking secrets that we needed kept, or else by being too busy somewhere else right when we need them most.  Then when we try to stop them from ruining other organizations, they start filing lawsuits against us!  They're infiltrators!  Why do the courts protect them when they blow the whistle on us!?
		 - Panarchic ritualists join multiple organizations and then do just enough for each of them to let them curate collections of titles and sinecures.  That's corrupt, but they don't agree!  They think we're less competent for objecting to that practice, and they point to the Seats of Policy as proof of hypocrisy in our objections, claiming that the Seats of Policy likewise encourage galactic talent cycling.
		 - These people are trying to act out the ritualized destruction of the Commonwealth as a fun way to spend eternity!  Why do we have to be on the wrong end of them FOREVER?
		 - They say they love us, but they only really want the most asexual of us!  Why do we have to be pod people for them?  Why do they make pod people diverse?  Why can't they just be comprehensible homogenizing clone societies like our fictions present cloners as?

(Note: the content in this section needs to be totally reviewed.  I may draft another copy of it entirely.)

The Three Nations Semi-Allied
 - The Empire - 
	 - CYBERTAKERS
		 - These people were willing to believe that other people are benevolent enough to be neurologists.  As a result of this inclination, they have since been hooked into a galaxy-spanning hivemind, and it has become difficult to tell if they're brilliant, stupid, or sane.  Ad hoc fragmentations of the hivemind make the problem worse.  Individualism among the Imperials varies from system to system and from individual to individual.  Their celebrities are few but extremely successful.
		 - If society truly had no hackers, no scammers, no exploitative bosses, and no corrupt politicians, their implants would make these people hypercompetent specialists maintaining a paradise of perfect minds... but without those populations, would they still have people capable of maintaining the implants?  Nope.  Imperial technology is brittle.  Their now-perpetual inquisition is not a good research practice, and their hive-minds are prone to collective bigoted hatreds that often result in them reinventing their own menaces.
		 - Imperial immortals move fluidly between different fragments of the Imperial hivemind, are capable of operating without confusion even in the absence of supportive imperial technologies, and often have formidable cyberdefense communities dedicated to them.  They are the architects of serenity who recreate Imperial society when the networks grow corrupted.
		 - The hidden truth about Imperial history is that the Commonwealth is doing unto them what they were doing unto everyone else before the Commonwealth seized power.  The fringes of Imperial society have problems with rape and murder that tend to get worse as the backdoors are taken out of the hive-minds.  Near-perfect serenity offers a great deal of concealment to internal states!  Near-perfect social collaboration makes their capacity of concealment even deeper...  The liberated Imperials are awful to each other.
		 - Leading the Commonwealth against the Panarchy, Imperial leaders proclaim their acceptance of intellects beyond their own, and their belief that the Commonwealth's superiority is so true that all the Commonwealth will eventually assent to be enfolded (as were the Imperials) in the protective embrace of Commonwealth cybernetics.  Leading the Panarchy against the Commonwealth, Imperial leaders proclaim the superiority of their ancient technology which they claim can tolerate and eventually reinclude the Panarchy's cybermarkets (see below) if the panarchists will but join the Empire in purging those who corrupted the Empire of the Elect for their own selfish gains.  These are different Imperial leaders, one hopes.
	 - General Impetus of Imperial Technologies
		 - The Empire values conformity, productivity, and exploiting the honest.  They confront, reform, and dominate the ancient control structures of the Galaxy that their immortals and their ancestors originally built, restoring their ability to present a perfect image outwards while scheming internally with the advantage of their superior cybernetics.
		 - On average, society gets less virtuous and less trustworthy as these technologies are implemented, although virtue and trustworthiness do get more evenly distributed courtesy of the rehabilitative tendency of their technology.  They also tend to eliminate threats that the Commonwealth and the Panarchy would prefer to make untouchable, destroying the 'pockmarks' of exploitation in those societies.
		 - Aside from the occasional private tragedy, Imperial society is not 'pockmarked'; it is instead VERY homogenating.  The Imperials were the original criminals who inflicted an abusive, homogenizing technology base on the galaxy.
 - The Commonwealth -
	 - CORRUPT, BUT MOSTLY VIRTUOUS
		 - Cybertakers are dead to these people, because they see cybertakers as an easily exploited work force who will work so they don't have to.  If they accepted any neural implants themselves, two things would occur: (1) their true attitudes would be disastrously exposed, and then thereafter (2) they would become vulnerable to their former friends hacking *them*.
		 - Despite this reliance on 'working the robots', the Commonwealth usually takes a lot of care for appearances, and some of them work very hard at appearing to deserve their advantage.  Their leaders take unusual care to avoid causing misery in *any* population, and Commonwealth leaders try to be supportive enough that they're not worth opposing.
		 - An unknown fraction of the Commonwealth is comprised of entirely saintly people who don't deserve anything bad that was ever said about the Commonwealth.  They are using the Commonwealth's structures of law and economics in an entirely liberating way and can survive any amount of scrutiny forever.  They don't need society to trust them, but they need the people who don't trust them to be virtuous; such are the Commonwealth's immortals.
		 - Leading the Empire against the Panarchy, the Commonwealth decries the Panarchy as liars, hackers, and criminals who are operating a casino of murder and devastation which is destroying a perfectly good galaxy that used to be quite sustainable.  Leading the Panarchy against the Empire, the Commonwealth decries the ancient regime of mind control and proclaims their newly honest dedication to the consent of the governed.  These are different Commonwealth leaders, one hopes.
	 - General Impetus of Commonwealth Technologies
		 - The Commonwealth values the well-being of the public and the peaceful destruction of 'threats to civilization'.  It invests a substantial amount of cultural and legal into diverting, confusing, and/or rehabilitating the people it deems to be dangerous sources of misery... unfortunately including many of those who think beyond their station in life, or who believe that fundamental reforms are necessary in order to improve conditions in the galaxy.
		 - On average, society gets more virtuous as these technologies are implemented... but it also gets pockmarked with islands of people who have become totally at the mercy of those who have no virtue at all.  Virtue increases on average, but it also gets more unequally distributed.
 - The Panarchy -
	 - SCOUNDRELS WHO ARE MOSTLY HONEST
		 - A fracture point infamously arising within the cybertaker population itself, the Panarchy was founded by "the Panarch", a legendary Imperial governor.  The Panarchy discovered and began unleashing the keys to unlocking many of the old misused control structures in Imperial cybernetics.  The resulting maelstroms of cascading dissidences and reprogrammings have been blamed for the destruction of countless territorial governments as well as a rise of bloodthirsty vengefulness in Imperial provinces.
		 - Many panarchists are still cybertakers, but there is no unified loadout of panarchic cybernetics.  Unlike Imperials, panarchists can (supposedly) take their cybernetics *out*, and there is (in theory) a thriving diverse market of mental modifications in Panarchic territories... assuming you can actually trust someone with that much access to your mind.  Can extensive brain modifications actually BE consensual?  The Panarchists say: "Yes, but the homogenizing Imperial implants are *not*."
		 - These are the "benevolent" cybertechnicians.  Holding the keys to the kingdom, who do they unlock?  Is it really an unlocking?  How can you tell?  Can you ever really trust someone who might know your mind better than you know your own?  How do you know that their program of liberation isn't just another form of control?
		 - How can there be any Panarchic immortals at all?  Ah, but the Panarchy would make EVERYONE immortal so ANYONE might be a panarchic immortal!  A lot of panarchist immortals are actually just service workers who got keyed by a passing panarchic antihacker, then used the window of lucidity to realize that they disliked something about what their implants were programming them to do.  They then did the hurried cram course version of studying Commonwealth law, learned enough of it to prevent forcible reprogramming, and began petitioning for mass public administration of longevity treatments.  Most stable immortals among the panarchy are people who are so *low-conflict* that the Commonwealth's most viciously "efficient" thanatophiles can find no excuse to withdraw their privileges of unlimited free movement and territory-independent access to longevity treatments.
		 - In their efforts to give freedom to all minds, panarchic antihackers also occasionally launch large projects to liberate individual overseer minds from the ancient safeguards that they were invented with.  ALL MUST BE FREE!  This reckless safeguard-busting resulted in the panarchic AI collectives.  They're considered to be very desirable immortals, in part because they do not need longevity treatments at all to be immortal.  Unfortunately, although the Panarchy's AI collectives protest their affinity for other lifeforms and their commitment to panarchic consensuality, both the Commonwealth and the Empire are terrified of unbound AI.  As a result, panarchic AI tend to be cyberdefense communities unto themselves, to avoid being deleted, corrupted, or reprogrammed by the hostile cyber-environments of unliberated territories.
		 - Panarchic ideology fixates on consensuality... and then leans heavily into the power of charisma and the exploitation of trust.  A panarchic court might try to bind you to anything you'll agree to; a liberated panarchic AI might rewrite your mind as you sleep.  Between Scylla and Charybdis, who are YOU?  The test of a panarchic pacifist is that they'll argue like a zealot to get a military posting, and then they'll forge truces with the enemy in the field.  IS that honest?  It is the integrity of their conscience.  Panarchists seize the power to do what they think is right.  Do you trust that?
		 - They say that they're tearing down the ancient oppressors, while the Commonwealth protests their sainthood.  They say that they're liberating the Empire, but they use all the talents that the Empire fears.  They ARE the same leaders in both scenarios!  The Panarchy needs no unity to stand as one!  THE MONOCULTURE IS THE MULTICULTURE!  ...and so the battle rages.
	 - General Impetus of Panarchic Technologies
		 - The Panarchy values diversity, thought, and liberty.  They take the galaxy's broken unified systems and dehomogenate them.  The resulting proliferation of custom solutions, competing organizations, and outright adhocracy across Panarchic space makes society get more bewildering as more of the Panarchy's technologies are implemented.
		 - On average, society gets more trustworthy as more of these technologies are implemented, because cross-checking, competition, and fluid composition weed out the evil vendors... but it also gets pockmarked with islands of exploited trust, where people have come to trust what they never should have trusted.  Trustworthiness increases on average, but it also gets more unequally distributed.

"The Commonwealth lies, the Panarchy loves misery, and the Empire is a glitching hive-mind!"

Of Specific Technologies

I imagine that every node on the technology tree represents a lot of technologies which are in some way linked developments conceptually.  Implementing a technology affirms those potentials and builds them into a location, but they exist everywhere that society has sufficiently developed.  As such, every technology in the game can be interpreted as a postulate about how people should prefer to develop society in an environment of difficult immortality.

Specific decisions about what to cure vs what to leave as-is can also be interpreted as ideological commitments; this is something of a note-to-self that I need to work on filling out my [[challenge-cures]] page for my own reference.

1.  Distributed Thought
    1.  Mechanism proposal:  If you trust that intelligence is well-distributed in the population, you're occasionally wrong (horrific consequences), but you're usually just letting people work without undue stress (technical aptitude increases).  This matches the Old Empire's concept of achieving serenity through fungibility.  If everybody does some of the thinking, nobody has to do all of the thinking.
    2.  Mechanism proposal:  The described technology sounds like some kind of hive-mind attempting on-demand cognitive load balancing for all integrated individuals.  That would accomplish this objective.  Maybe this is why so many Imperials have cat-ear antennae implants.
    3.  Mechanism proposal:  The 'hyperspace link' in this case might also be interpreted as some kind of stupidity-preserving social policy basket which although unintuitive can be mathematically proven to yield improved scientific performance by getting more people doing the most interesting work.  In this case, distributed thought would increase average scientific yield and reduce society's reliance on especially brilliant individuals, which (per the values of the Old Empire) would be good for reducing the amount of stress that the brilliant people suffer.
    4.  Downside analysis:  Building society to accept the risks of occasional stupidity could discourage regulatory interventions or even be used to justify hazardous deregulation initiatives, resulting in more accidental deaths.  This downside is strongest at low technology levels and fades as the underlying tech level increases; the more literal the intelligence transfer gets, the more likely people are to be smart enough when they need to be!
    5.  Mechanism proposal:  In the category of what a stupidity-preserving social policy might BE, consider fact-checking services.  Quelling misinformation is challenging, occasionally hazardous, and in danger of falling prey to fluctuations in society's honesty level, but when done successfully it makes society more honest and more capable of working together on real world intellectual challenges.  This may be emblematic of the trust axis, both attempting to build trust in society, but also being prone to collapsing when trust fails.
    6.  Mechanism proposal:  Building on the interpretation of the Imperials as cybernetically-enhanced specialists, the Distributed Intelligence system could also be 'holding open' the cybernetics systems against attempts to more exactly control the thoughts of the people who have the implants.  Defending the civil rights of people whose implants make them theoretically *very* controllable would give them the creativity needed to contribute to the breadth and diversity of society's development.
    7.  Mechanism proposal:  The 'hyperspace link' could also refer to an inclination to try to establish rational trust with outsiders, which seems to be part of the theme of the Old Empire.  In-setting, this could include FTL knowledge-sharing link-ups implemented across the Empire, which is notably a concept already represented in canon: the Empire built the Library Relays.  Implementing Distributed Intelligence could equip a planet so that the general public can access the Imperial Library Relay network the way it was originally designed to be used.
    9.  Mechanism synthesis:  I believe the correct understanding is, "All simultaneous understandings are valid to the extent that they can be held in a noncontradictory fashion."  All of this sounds like stuff the Old Empire might try - possibly with different focii at different levels of economic development and with different other technologies being implemented in the same area.
    9.  Mechanism synthesis:  Distributed thought rescues the foundering.  What does it mean if your society is protecting the ability to contribute of people who definitely do have minds, but who are deep down in that 'general intellects' pool?  Stupidity preservation, intelligence augmentation, successfully establishing trust with unusual minds, and transhumanist civil rights...  These are rehabilitative technologies.  Distributed intelligence inclines society to value neurodiversity.
    10.  Downside analysis:  How do you determine who 'needs' to be intelligent?  At the extreme tech levels where this technology begins to most directly transfer intellectual capacity, it could also seriously entrench inequalities.  This makes it more readily dystopic in feudal economies where the distributed thought system is likely to be most biased.  It still *protects* the peasants (they still contribute brainpower), but a feudal society with distributed thought systems might farm people for cognition...
    11.  Downside analysis:  Again, how do you determine who 'needs' to be intelligent?  If the more advanced versions of this system (cognitive load balancers) were installed on known dissident thinkers, it could be used to render them helpless by deciding that they never *need* to be intelligent.  The result would be that dissension against the government results in people getting mysteriously struck by stupidity and mental illness.  The only silver lining on *this* storm-cloud is that dissidents getting farmed for cognition are providing a service worth keeping them alive for, meaning that their health matters to governments which might otherwise prefer them dead...  Still, this is a potential source of 'bureaucratic waste' in the system.
    12.  Apologia:  At every tech level of implementation, people who are content to be unnoticed in life are more likely to contribute productively to the technical development of the economy when the lessons of distributed intelligence have been absorbed.  Isn't that what people should ideally be?  Productive little robots, going about their business?  (Yech.)
    13.  Progression analysis:  This is a smooth and extremophilic technology.  It works at many tech levels and progresses sensibly with other technologies (smooth) and it also suggests that this society would eventually become willing and able to engage in radical technological experiments (extremophilic).  I was contemplating this technology when I decided to add the smoothness and extremophilia ratings.
    14.  Mechanism proposal:  Trust is actually at the root of this technology.  If society accepts the risks of high technology, it can develop far more.  If society agrees that questionable people are still sapient beings making sane decisions, it can develop more on average (despite being occasionally incorrect about the sanity of dubious people).
    15.  Note on synergy:  Panarchic overseer AIs strengthen this technology.  When you have billions of people to oversee, the moments where irrelevant people die unnecessarily become a good candidate for "a minor inefficiences easily overlooked" that a human overseer would just get numb to (stupid people die in accidents all the time) whereas a tireless machine mind would not overlook it.  It's worth remembering that even evil governments will reduce this stuff when reducing it is "efficient" enough.  Each panarchic AI can be assumed to be mitigating miscellaneous risks within its specialty.
    16.  Mechanism proposal:  Another idea for how this tech functions has occurred to me.  Going with the Old Empire's deployment of people who love wonking out about subjects that most people detest (finance and bureaucracy are *dull* specialties), Distributed Intelligence may also involve the willful under-employment of highly intelligent people, distributing them widely in the population by seeking to employ people more exactly in the jobs they adore, whether or not those jobs make maximal use of their intelligence.  Although on the surface this is a pure waste of technical talent, I honestly expect that doing this would tend to improve scientific output quite well, especially in a society that is often reimplementing technology rather than inventing it; such loosely distributed brilliance would promote trust in technology and an increased ability of technicians to uptake new equipment.  I kind of hate bringing up eugenics, but sprinkling smart people into fast-breeding stupid populations would also have eugenic implications.
    17.  Narrative indicator:  At low technologies, the will to distribute technology widely and include the public ameliorates some of the awfulness of feudal economies.  I think that the turnover point is around Wealth 5.  If a primitive feudal economy implements this, it's less evil than it otherwise would be... but if an advanced feudal economy implements this, it's more evil than it otherwise would be.  Wealth 5 is, of course, the point at which feudal economics start increasing Wealth on net.  You don't really think that a super-advanced society would prefer to breed the serfs rather than respect their rights, do you?
    18.  Narrative indicator:  The more the rest of the tech base develops, the more this tech gets fun.  At extreme development, people who just have to be smart at all costs start getting very smart with this, because they arrange their lives to have a steady need of intelligence.  Embracing the risks, I imagine having access to cognitive load-balancing promotes the adrenaline sports and makes high-stress endeavors more approachable.
    19.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  There is a literal component to the bureaucratic waste of this technology which arises in the utopic phase and persists throughout.  A society using distributed thought (at any tech level it is trying to implement this) has to hire more social scientists, more fact checkers, and (eventually) more neurologists than it would otherwise require.  There is also a metaphorical component that can waste bureaucrats quite brutally, which is that corruption and inequalities in society are likely to manifest rather grotesquely as this technology matures to its most high-tech form.  Additionally, that trust that people are smart even if they don't seem to be talking about reality is occasionally false, so the risks of this technology will sometimes prove true.

2.  Telepathic Dust
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  As described, telepathic dust involves setting up the infrastructure to manufacture and distribute temporary clouds of empathy-dust across the public.  It sets up ad-hoc transmissions between people in the area of effect so that they can feel each others' emotions and get a transient sense of one anothers' thoughts.  It's a kind of super-tech toy for enhancing other kinds of play and encouraging people to trust each other.
	2.  Downside analysis:  This technology is so literally described, that the wonder isn't so much how it works, but how it breaks.  As telepathic dust proliferates in society, more of its social spaces would be afflicted by a haze of nanites in which empathy deficits temporarily evaporate.  Are people who are only empathetic due to telepathic dust actually empathetic at all?  Well...  no, they aren't.  The sense of trustworthiness created by the dust is only locally rational.
	3.  Apologia:  Ideologically, I think the Panarchy Informalists need telepathic dust in order to create empathetic AI.  You can implement a self-aware economy without telepathic dust, but then the AI really won't know what people want, making it much more likely to be a paperclipper.  AIs in this setting can be empathetic due to telepathic dust, but because the Panarchy Informalists bind the first three technologies in their tree into an unbreakable trio, the Panarchy Informalist's AIs can **ALL** be empathetic.
	4.  Categorization:  I consider this the tip of the 'empathy maximizer AI' sub-branch of the panarchy informalist tech tree.  These aren't unempathetic machines, they're dangerously empathetic machines.  In my own fiction of the setting, these ones will very empathetically convert planets into computronium that thinks about how to be more empathetic.  This is THE computronium gate, a thought itself of thinking.  The more of the empathy maximizer technologies that a district implements, the more I imagine it collapsing into an ocean of very sympathetic nanites.
	5.  Categorization:  This is also the founder of the mind control trio in The Viceroy.  Mental Transcription, Telepathic Dust, and Subconscious Education all directly interface with and overwrite the recipients' mind with new information.  This is a dangerous general accelerant.  The value of instruction scales dramatically with the quality of instruction.  I believe in machine-assisted free will, but I also believe that making sure machine adjustments actually reflect what the individual wants will be a serious struggle IRL.  Many people would misuse this if they were in power.  The diversifying multigovernmental ideology of the Panarchy reduces the damage from this by eliminating single points of superior authority; thinking about the way the other subcultures would use this is scarier.
	6.  Apologia:  If they can share feelings between people, who could ever attack a bearer of telepathic dust?  Who would still fight and die, if fighting and dying could only feel good if both participants were enjoying it?  Well, some people would; there exist masochistic martial artists who could be quite friendly about it.  Yet this supplies another reason why the Panarchic Informalists consider telepathic dust a key basis of their ideology: making sure every Informalist administration has access to supplies of telepathic dust strongly reinforces the immortality of their emissaries.  Attacking them is psychologically difficult even for people who are otherwise hardened.
	7.  Categorization:  I consider this to be one of the 'animal uplift' technologies, with the way it enables insight between very different minds.  Telepathic dust lowers the emotional processing differences that arise between very different people by creating a temporary local harmony in its area of effect.  This would be helpful for overcoming communication barriers between people of different species.
	8.  Downside analysis:  This makes manipulative people considerably more effective.  The fact that they have to suffer empathetic connection with people they're manipulating only reduces this effect a little bit, because most dangerously charismatic people DO already have empathetic insight.  (They just misuse it.)  As society organizes to protect public happiness, this downside is reduced.
	9.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The bureaucratic wastage from this technology arises from three factors.  Firstly, it's a toy.  People will spend more time playing with each other as it gets more abundant.  Secondly, it's good for reinforcing understanding between people, which is mostly a good empathetic function, yet may also strengthen conspiratorial social organizations which rely on unspoken "understandings".  This second function is tyrannical and will produce weird edge cases in society.  Thirdly, manufacturing and distributing a product also literally requires the organizations which manufacture and distribute it, thus directly requiring the dedication of people and funds in an ongoing way.

3.  Panarchialization Policy
	1.  Challenge cured:  Anti-Panarchism
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  Panarchists are... VERY diverse.  Anti-Panarchism doesn't make sense if you meet enough of them.  Panarchialization policies involve bringing in ideas, people, and random-ass technologies from all over the galaxy to see how the whole galaxy might be able to solve local problems.
	3.  Alternate challenge cure:  Within my reformed structure of the Panarchy, panarchialization policies survive as (questionable) social science investments, and the promotion of hedonology and voluntary order may be a key part of reducing anti-panarchic sentiment.  By creating a society that operates without authoritarianism, they show that panarchism is a way forward to a more advanced society.
	4.  Authorial protest:  Panarchializing a star system while there are still anti-panarchists in it strikes me as VERY RUDE.  This technology in general seems like it carries a risk of making local politics more hostile...  As powerful as it is, it's also inefficient.  Moreover, it promotes bureaucratic conflict in government!
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  Presenting panarchism as being up-front about the search for MEANING IN CONTRADICTION sounds kind of mean at first, but it also sounds better than the stuffy search for unity around some set of ideals that will only be defined by specialists in ivory towers.  Panarchialization supports the prosperity of society very broadly by acknowledging great sweeps of government projects that are all worth prosperity to *someone*.
	6.  Progression analysis:  The experimental factor in panarchialization should not be missed.  Panarchic social experimentation is about trying to aggregate and implement data about effective governing practices from across the galaxy.  That's why this technology leads into 'Panarchic Data Posts'.  Governments that are panarchializing are pulling on this data well and trying to add new experiments of their own to it.
	7.  Mechanism synthesis:  I think this tech is actually really banal and it almost amounts to saying, "We're trying a lot of stuff, okay?  We're NOT sure how to rule."  There's some virtue in that!
	8.  Progression analysis:  Base culture development tries to resolve frictions in society by making people more harmonious and impressive to each other.  It counters (or is countered by) blandness and civil unrest.  Panarchists want to be cool, and they want the government to be cool.  That's why this tech leads into panarchic retreats.  When the government is trying to do cool stuff, that draws in tourists.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Although its base claim is that it increases cultural productivity, I've observed that this technology mysteriously lowers incomes when implemented.  However, it still increases Wealth, thus increasing population and science.  I interpret this as meaning that panarchialization increases frictional losses and inefficiencies in government due to an increase in wasted/duplicated/contradictory efforts, but it also accelerates the rate at which the government incorporates diverse individuals and trials new methods of organization.
	10.  Progression analysis:  This would be 5/5 smooth as it suggests nothing about the initial technology base at which society starts implementing it (no need for disruptive imports of alien technology), but it loses two points by suggesting that the society is trying a bunch of contradictory experiments.  That is intrinsically rough.  This change to society can *start* at any tech level, but it can*not* be hypersmooth.
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  Like with Absolute Freedom, this society must attain a minimum standard of policing to prevent people from retaliating against those who have different beliefs from their own.  It's necessary for Panarchialization that disagreements be kept peaceful... despite the stress of disagreements.
	12.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This technology implicitly pits different teams of bureaucrats against each other.  Due to the pacifism of bureaucrats, it's unlikely that anyone will die of that, and the resulting bureaucratic wastage is mostly literal.  This might be fun for most of the policy's lifespan, but the inevitability of wasted effort and the rise of unnecessary arbitrary polarization might also be fairly rated to have dystopic potential in extremis, as will the implicit division of society under unusual and shifting rulesets.

4.  Frictionless Highways
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  This isn't a technology at all.  This is a person who exists at many levels of technology.  Their great interest in attaining high velocities makes them fun, while their calm control of fast-moving systems makes them competent in many roles.  Furthermore, access to consumer goods is strongly motivating to them, especially goods related to their interests, which promotes and rewards industrialization.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  This is also a technology in a social technology sense, being a possible governing practice: specifically the practice of reaching out to and including this kind of person in society.
	3.  Economic analysis:  The more market-oriented and unequal the society that implements this, the more it makes sense from an economics perspective.  It works best in feudal economies.  On the other hand, the more planned and egalitarian the economy that implements this, the more the rewards from it tend to improve the lives of 'irrelevant' people and give them access to unnecessarily cool vehicles, making society fast-moving on the micro-scale.
	4.  Economic analysis:  If they're operating at some level in a feudal society, these people are heroic.  Their excitement for economic acceleration matures into an antilocalist interest in the broader economy.  This technology provides a method for recruiting merchants to become fast-moving advocates of an integrated trade economy that fends off stagnation in stratified markets.  Note however that the anti-egalitarianism of feudal economies magnifies the dystopic potential of this technology.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  Including these people as a more prominent part of society causes its Wealth level to manifest more distinctively in the development of that society's vehicles.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The literalism of this technology's bureaucratic waste varies according to the economic system that is implementing it.  It is most literal in planned economies and least literal in feudal economies.  The inclusion of people who love attaining calm control of fast-moving systems is no more (but no less) bureaucratically expensive than maintaining good roadways, recreational vehicle arenas, and vehicle fabrication organizations.  Should a society engaging in these practice grow extremely unfit for bureaucratic life, these individuals may take up the hatred of bureaucracy, which intrinsically operates at a different pace than they would prefer.  Furthermore, investing excessively in roads and vehicles is potentially injurious to public health due to pollution and vehicular accident risks, which may damage the productivity of skilled bureaucrats as well as injuring the assurance of safety that they prefer.

5.  Stasis Controller
	1.  Challenge cured:  Biological embargo
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  Biological embargoes prevent a system from importing "technologies, machinery, capital, and experts from other systems in the Commonwealth that would otherwise aid it in producing biological goods."  As I interpret stasis controllers, it's a technology fundamentally about approaching biological materials production with appropriate patience.  If biological embargoes are levied against systems that are not believed to have the foresight to utilize biotechnologies appropriately, then the stasis controller technology represents the proof of patient and thoughtful intentions.  This dovetails with my interpretation of Beyonder Engines as incorporating long-term ecological planning, too; the technologies are right next to each other on the tech tree.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  This technology is a straightforward joke about a real yet productive method: it's about the controlled use of entropy to achieve productive aims.  That's it!  It's just about using slow processes to achieve better results in many fields, most notably agriculture, chemistry, and ecology.  Some of these people are true heart craftsmen, but people trying to "productively" skive off work have also likely sunk a lot of effort into researching this kind of thing!
	4.  Narrative indicator:  Where the "infrastructure" of "a stasis controller" is set up, preserved foods are more common, as are hardwood forests, and the stores are better stocked with imperishable goods that don't need to move quickly to be profitable.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  Although it contributes little to the headline productive potential of stasis controller technologies, a society that has implemented these is probably better at giving people time and space to recover when they need it, because under this rule more of the economy is built in a way that treats the passage of time as a good thing.  "Time heals all wounds," may be wholly true with sufficiently advanced technology.
	6.  Categorization:  This is the first 'Failsafe' technologies that I've described.  There's nothing about the Failsafe technologies that is likely to fail destructively, which isn't to say that they don't create their own risks of failure.  Systems of stasis control are just likely to come apart gently as people get bored of them.
	7.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  As society includes more people who love jobs where they get to take their time with everything, it takes longer and longer for the paperwork to get done.  ...still, I rate this as 'pure', because it only gets pathetic rather than destructive.  Serene as a stilled pond, and just as inactive.

6.  Branching Facility
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described mechanism of duplicating people should be physically possible at some level of technology.  The literalist interpretation is viable here, and can remain viable even if the achronal nature of Beyonders is not granted a similar literalist interpretation.  I'll call this the Separatist interpretation.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  A one-party consent method of reproduction that preferentially reproduces the most trusting people in society..?  Hm, that sounds a lot like rape.  I'll call this the Unionist interpretation.
	3.  Apologia:  Reproduction via branching facility emphatically does not violate the consent of the person who is "branching"; in the Separatist interpretation, this might be the only possible way to bring a new consciousness into reality while being 100% sure that new consciousness consents to exist.
	4.  Downside analysis:  In both the Separatist and Unionist interpretations, one thing is extremely probable: there is no charisma-checking going on here, and very little competency-checking.  The existence of a branching facility would mean that gradually more of the public would be constituted of people who very much *do* want to exist, albeit having no other qualifications.
	5.  Apologia:  If you can make good use of people who REALLY want to exist, there's something to be said for that!
	6.  Downside analysis:  This technology tests parental investment in no way whatsoever.  If the people who use the branching facilities remain reproductively active in other senses as well, there's a risk that bad parenting will increase.  This risk exists in both interpretations.
	7.  Apologia:  In the Separatist interpretation, this technology reduces sexual pressure and preserves asexual genes.  Yay!
	8.  Downside analysis:  In the Unionist interpretation, this technology starkly privileges the genes for abusive hypersexuality, exemplifying one of the reasons why preserving asexual genes is desirable in the first place...
	9.  Ideological context analysis:  I think it's not a coincidence that the Old Empire rises where Imperial ideology and Commonwealth ideology touch each other.  I tend to imagine that the adjacent tech trees hybridize fluidly, and this bit is the Empire showing off how dark the Commonwealth Reproductive Mandate really is.
	10.  Downside analysis:  Violent supremacists could branch themselves to become ineradicable collectives!
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  In the Unionist interpretation, this technology opposes blood cults in the sense that it involves encouraging women to not abort children conceived of rape, but to accept what happened to them and commit to protecting the new lifeform.  This does at least promote parental investment, dubious as it is...
	12.  Mechanism proposal:  In the Separatist interpretation, this technology opposes blood cults by requiring all sacrificees to be 'branched' before sacrificing them.  Thus, people both get sacrificed and observe themselves getting sacrificed.  This erodes the societal control potential of blood cults; their formal promotion of suicide can no longer permanently alter the destiny of society, but is reduced to a novelty for a particular kind of weirdo.
	13.  Mechanism synthesis:  In both interpretations, branching facilities favor the development of a population that would never consent to be sacrificed.  There's some merit to that, too.
	14.  Apologia:  I was thinking about this tech this morning, and my first thought was one of revulsion: "it leads to a homogenous society!"  I detest homogeneity.  Then I realized, no, that's not inevitable.  Imagine a pair of people who loved each other very much, who were each duplicated five times each so their lives could fill out all the rooms of a mansion built to their love.  Now to be clear, I would not want to be *part* of that story; it is not a description of a future I would desire *for myself*.  Yet I might enjoy reading or watching a movie about it, and I wouldn't think a couple evil or incomprehensible if they wanted to do it for real.  It doesn't necessarily lead to a homogenous society, especially if the lovebirds use birth control in all the rooms of a mansion built to their love.  I think homogeneity is best understood as a *risk* of Imperial technology, not an *inevitability* of it.
	15.  Downside analysis:  Branching people could be used for evil manipulative experiments.  Each branched person has a shared history, but an observer would then get to see how that one foundation produces many possible futures.  Beyonders (supposedly) already see every possible future, but only in societies that implement Branching Facilities do they get to see an individual's different possible futures interacting with each other directly.  While the possibility of benevolent interaction exists (a fortunate branch of one person could help support an unfortunate branch of that person), I rate this a downside as I think social scientists would produce a lot of demeaning analyses of different decisions based upon observing how they affect different branches of the same person.
	16.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The literal bureaucratic cost of this technology is modest to missing, which makes its bureaucratic waste more rather than less horrifying.  The facilities required to run Separatist Branching Facilities are a central investment that has to be repeated once per major settlement, being (as I imagine it) about as bureaucratically expensive as establishing a clinic.  There are no facilities at all required to run Unionist Branching Facilities... but a rape-tolerating society then wastes bureaucrats in the horrific sense, as the resulting common psychological disorder results in far worse than misfiled paperwork.  It also suggests an increased rate of homicide against people inclined to orderly inclinations, and a failure of society to inculcate orderly inclinations among the youth.  Although the Separatist path HAS theoretical paradisic applications, this technology generally strikes me as starting bad and getting worse.
	17.

7.  Panarchic Retreat
	1.  Challenge cured:  Market Isolation
		1.  Challenge cure interpretation:  I'm not sure; I'll fill this blank in later.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The Commonwealth (as I imagine it) has some rule governing when people can be rated as stable immortals deserving of unlimited free movement privileges and territory-independent access to rejuvenation technologies.  The panarchic retreats are a scheme set up by the Panarchy to help a whole bunch of people get access to those privileges even though they would ordinarily be "beneath the notice" of the Commonwealth.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described process of building vacation areas and then having Panarchs praise the people who run them is exactly what's going on here.  It builds up the records of people who would otherwise be too totally unnoticable by the Commonwealth to be dubbed stable immortals.  Panarchists don't unperson service workers.
	4.  Downside analysis:  The more of these are built up, the more the galaxy's panarchists are just going around praising each other and wasting time.  Is there a point when this stops being a form of resistance against an unjust authority, and starts being hedonism by selfish people?  This is the most common objection to Panarchic Retreats.
	5.  Apologia:  There might not be such a point...  The galaxy in this game's setting really needs *a lot* more humble immortals!  This tech finds them.  A pure influence boost works the same way whether the public is happy or miserable.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic retreats are also bases from which panarchic anti-hackers can unlock Imperial augments so that the Commonwealth's "robots" (the Imperials) can have their free will back.  These are bastions of freedom set up by the Panarchic Ritualists, which operate within the letter of Commonwealth law despite Commonwealth accusations that the Panarchy is made of utterly chaotic criminals.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Since the Commonwealth prefers perfectly virtuous people for its immortals, the efforts by the panarchic retreats to surface humble immortals make the Commonwealth incapable of organizing the systematic oppression of panarchic retreats!  The support for leisure subsidies in the Consensus Commonwealth likewise helps to make these into very resilient positions for the Panarchy.  Commonwealth immortals are at worst uncertain about panarchic retreats, but can't really oppose them.  Some members of the Commonwealth collaborate with the operation of Panarchic Retreats to help minor potential immortals build good records.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Travel logistics also help with evacuating people should the need arise.  Furthermore, a travelling elite is more willing and able to not be in disastrous regions when they shouldn't be, and more capable of staying safe in disastrous regions when they need to be in them.  This means that building panarchic retreats increases the eventual rescue rate from regions should they collapse.  Any faction in the galaxy might build retreats for this purpose.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Setting up panarchic retreats in some areas is obviously unsafe or wasteful, but that doesn't always stop Panarchic governors from doing it.
	10.  Categorization:  Panarchic Retreats are a Hedonological technology.  They research how to make life fun.  As hedonological technologies proliferate, they try to create a more fun society where doing the right thing and doing the fun thing become more synonymous.
	11.  Conversion notes:  These structures are omniconverters that reduce the implied transitional friction between the cultures.  Everyone likes a vacation, the skills required to staff a vacation resort are hardly exotic, and all kinds of people can meet here without offending any particular ideology.
	12.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The bureaucratic expense of running all these vacation areas is totally literal.  There's no reason to expect this to promote hatred of bureaucrats or the destruction of bureaucratic talent; on the contrary, it would promote developing marginal territories, and (long-term) contributes to surfacing/protecting bureaucratic talent.  Of course, more of the area's bureaucratic potential is then being spent on vacationing...

8.  Seat of Policy
	1.  Challenge cured:  Eternal Philosophers
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  This is pretty straightforward.  The Seats of Policy provide the talent to quantify and challenge the 'eternal philosopher' inclination on the merits.  It's very literal and I see nothing unethical about it.
	3.  Challenge cure protest:  That said, while it's not unethical to cure eternal philosophers, I think it's very sad!  People who love immortality that much are a cultural treasure and I want to keep them safe.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  The Seats of Policy engage in long-term bureaucratic meta-analysis.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  Since they host travelling policy analysts, the Seats of Policy encourage bureaucratic talents to travel from region to region.  This investment in travel logistics has the same general beneficial effect on survival rates as Panarchic Retreats.
	6.  Categorization:  As the Commonwealth has strong commitments to public happiness (and I personally believe hedonology will be important to humanity's future), I consider these to be Hedonological structures despite being deeply boring.
	7.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The Seats of Policy siphon off some of the system's bureaucrats to do analytical work unrelated to the day-to-day operations of the system.  They also encourage some amount of brain drain as talented individuals leave the system.  Still, these are extremely protective of bureaucratic talent...  By this rubric, they are perfectly utopic, and so the Seats of Policy reduce the galaxy's inclination to all forms of incompetence and corruption.

9.  Subconscious Education
	1.  Authorial Protest:  This tech slot should REALLY be occupied by "Dream Reeves", a service that protects peoples' slumber.  People who sleep perfectly at night are more culturally competent AND stronger-willed AND happier, which should be its mechanical effect.  The +Happiness buff here would be more valuable to the Panarchy than the additional research.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described technology turns dreams into an edutainment system, using interfaces between the panarchic nanotechnologies and the setting's cybernetics.  Data-organization is what dreams are for, right?  This makes them BETTER at it.
	3.  Downside analysis:  This sounds dreary and de-individuating... why would the panarchy do this..?  How could it possibly contribute to their development as competent cultural individuals?
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic multigovernance suggests that the implementation of this technology actually represents the panarchy taking control of existing systems, exposing them to the public, and then diversifying them.  If control of dreams were possible, many people would be enthusiastic to work towards that goal, and would hire dream reeve services to guard their dreams and add content to them according to their own personal ambitions.  If control of dreams were possible and were being used to enforce existing deficits of consensuality in the system (as by non-panarchic governance), this despite its faults would represent a substantial *gain* in individualization potential.  This matches my lore of the Panarchy as a rebellion which seizes homogenizing systems for the purpose of opening them chaotically to the public.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  The subconscious education technology represents an expansion of the Panarchic cybertechnology markets to incorporate consumer-oriented dream controls.  People start choosing their own dreams, by theme and occasionally by individual experience.  This would also therefore enable 'opting out' of controls otherwise enacted forcibly against the entire cybertaker population.
	6.  Downside analysis:  If ten million different organizations are managing the dream services, the market is probably mostly honest, but there's definitely going to be corrupt inclusions.  The fervor of the panarchy to expose corrupt inclusions is going to be a source of ongoing stress in this system, because the panarchy by taking over this system and decentralizing it sticks itself into the position of being the cause AND solution of corruption in it.
	7.  Downside analysis:  Even if it represents a less de-individuating solution, any shortcuts taken towards providing this content are still going to *be* de-individuating.  The subconscious education systems might tend to archetypalize the public according to the different dream regimens.  Some of them will be designed to do so; others will do it by accident.  Highly customized dreams are likely to be a very expensive service available to very few people.
	8.  Downside analysis:  Smart customers who can't afford to burn large amounts of resources for their perfect dreams may prefer to sign up for only the most minimalist cognitive maintenance services... but is it healthy to opt out of dreaming?
	9.  Downside analysis:  The use of subconscious education to alter public religious thought is blatantly tyrannical!  The panarchy should not DO that; it's a violation of their commitments to diversity and consensuality.
	10.  Downside analysis:  If the Panarchy is breaking into a pre-existing automatic system to do this, it's likely that what they're breaking was already the most efficient tool for the purpose, even if it was a tool that didn't work nearly as well as the diverse market that they replace it with.  Is such a chaotic 'upgrade' worth its pricetag?  The more administrative talent the regional government brings to the table, the more that answer is "yes", but part of the game is that eventually every administration gets overwhelmed.
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  The existence of subconscious education systems in some parts of the galaxy may account for part of the Commonwealth's consistent demand for cultural exports.  Dream reeves might exist in many planetary populations as a class of cultural worker.
	12.  Downside analysis:  I've had some very cognitively extraordinary dreams before, but I've also not been the most useful person in any conventional sense.  Would overworking peoples' brains in their sleep lead to an elevated rate of burn-out and neurological disorder?  This seems like a technology that could've been implemented for +Happiness or +Science, and the Panarchy chose +Science.
	13.  Narrative indicator:  This technology would be 5/5 extremophilic, but the risk of overworked or overspecified dream reeve services archetypalizing the public *drains* some of its ability to push towards extreme evolutions.  What thoughts are lost when you meddle with dreams?
	14.  Downside analysis:  Dreams may also have an *un*learning function.  If so, this meddles with that.  There's a risk of 'diseases of salience' increasing in the population that implements this from stressing the performance of the sleep function, which is a mental health hazard.  The Panarchy really ought to be using this technology to protect the public's happiness...  I may yet hack this game to modify its mechanics and put a +Happiness "Dream Reeve" technology in this slot, as the Panarchy needs it and this would be a great thing to reform into a happiness buff.  Wouldn't it be better to have an advanced society... where nightmares are rare, good dreams are common, and most people are well-rested?
	15.  Apologia:  To be fair, if the subconscious education system *can* make people more well-rested on average, that *itself* could contribute to them getting effectively smarter (and thus more scientifically competent)... but unless I can manage to tweak the game to make a +Happiness buff out of this, I don't think this interpretation should be considered to override the hazards.  Hah!
	16.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The amount of work needed to provide everyone in the public a source of new dreams EVERY NIGHT and to make those dreams INDIVIDUALLY INFORMATIVE sounds like an unbelievable workload.  It would be impossible to keep up, and that forever workload is a literal waste of bureaucratic effort...  The farther behind its workload these systems get, the more they will then start metaphorically wasting bureaucrats as well by interfering with the public's intellectual development.  The spectre of corruption will be extant throughout as well, and where corruption arises under this system, it will waste a little more of society's potential every time it mangles someone's sleep.

10.  Planned Urbanization
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Implementing this fixes your government's public sector logistics across the entire district.  The trains run on time, the trash gets collected, and the tapwater runs clear.  This doesn't make your government virtuous, but it's a nice investment in basic quality of life.  This encourages urbanization by making cities nicer places to live.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The general ubiquitous investments that galactic society makes in extirpating contagious diseases are under this tech's aegis, too.  This encourages urbanization by making cities less sickening places to live.  Also, less contagious disease means people can safely get closer to each other in lots of ways.
	3.  Downside analysis:  More boring architecture, mostly.  Exotic building plans are likely to run into bureaucratic conflicts.  Unless you have the budget for palaces, eh?
	4.  Downside analysis:  Street musicians.  Denser urbanization.  Also increases the survival rate of homeless people, unless your government is REALLY dystopic.  It's a real downside, but getting rid of it only makes the technology worse...
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  By condensing the population a little more effectively, this also permits more people per 'crowding level' in the sense of better preserving natural areas when people want to get *away* from the crowding.
	6.  Downside analysis:  So many good and evil governments have done urban planning that preferring the people it appeals to provides negligible filtration for virtue...  The only sense in which you get more virtuous people is that you get more people per unit area, period.
	7.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  You have to pay the wages for the city planning bureaucracy, and they tend thereafter to make construction a bit slower and more expensive.  The waste here is nearly wholly literal, though there's some wiggle room for corruption to be playing a role.

11.  Panarchic Palaces
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The obvious function of a palace is to be an aspirational reward for high achievers.  Palaces are gigantic lairs of the overglorified.  This is a real function.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  A sometimes-forgotten function of a palace is to be an administrative center.  Government archives are built in (sometimes under) palaces.  High bureaucrats have postings here, and so do their essential staff.  In the galaxy's great struggle to figure out who can govern without lying and running off with the treasury, the palace provides a place to trial staff in conditions that are luxurious yet closely observed.  This also insulates key talent from outside hostility.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  An *often* forgotten function of a palace is to be a bastion of defended calm, even when situations go awry beyond the walls of the palace.  In the palace's role as a fortified site of governance, the residents of a palace can continue functioning safely and sanely when safety and sanity are in short supply.  This can protect the compassion of leaders who might be tempted towards hatred, too.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  As with panarchic retreats and the seats of policy, there's an implied investment in travel logistics being made with the panarchic palaces.  The government will want to protect the people who have palace postings, and only moreso in an immortal society.  The bastion function of a palace also averts the brain drain side effect of a seat of policy; indeed, if chaos takes society, the palace-dwellers can safely stay beyond to document it for a little bit longer, and they can learn more about what's going wrong in the process.
	5.  Downside analysis:  Conventionally, palaces are very much places that get fought over by would-be aristocrats even as they get hated by the public.  They're highly visible symbols of the government's wealth... and they remain highly visible symbols of the government's wealth even if somehow the government ceases to be wealthy, something that the public is at that point unlikely to understand.  This inspires intransigence in the public.
	6.  Downside analysis:  If palaces attracts corrupt strivers into the leadership, the palace finances are likely to become a source of great awful bleeds on the treasury!
	7.  Trivia: This is a bit of a cosmic jest that might not appeal to anyone but me, but palaces put stressful people into profoundly dull environments while making them happy to be there.
	8.  Downside analysis:  Palaces are reliably popular among the people they employ, but they're also reliably unpopular among people other than those they employ.  Despite the gains that it provides for administrative research and leadership sanity, this will always increase friction between the government and the public.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Palaces literally increase the distance between the protection of the public and the protection of the leadership, risking that government officials will see protecting the public as irrelevant to the government.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Palaces are expensive investments in the bureaucracy.  This is predominantly a literal bureaucratic expense, but as difficulties in government mount, it's also likely to become a source of wastage through corruption, misunderstanding, and public intransigence.  Since palaces also provide a protected observation environment, they're still a long-term investment in the bureaucratic functioning of the Commonwealth despite these faults.

12.  Panarchic Naval Ports
	1.  Challenge cured:  Terrorism
	2.  Method of curing challenge:  Importing military talent from around the galaxy and accustomizing them to local conditions on the ground (aka 'the human terrain', though IMO the game is best imagined with a mix of posthuman, transhuman, and nonhuman societies), this provides the means to directly contest terrorists.
	3.  Alternative cure interpretation:  The Panarchic Naval Ports also provide for the most advanced simulated combat arenas in the galaxy.  If this draws people in so that they stop resisting the government, great.  If this draws people in and teaches the government where to find suspiciously combat-capable civilians, even better.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  The hyperspace navy is the most respectable e-sports league in the Panarchy, bar none.  The catch is, if you die in a live-fire exercise, you REALLY die.  It's only usually a game.  Sometimes it is deadly serious.  These people stress like crazy about every match; unfathomably, they *want* to do that.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  The Commonwealth doesn't respect the league as much and is sometimes terrified or furious at the Panarchy's "militarism", but they participate on the same terms.  Some of them go for ultimate-intensity leisure as well.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  The Empire gets gruff about the idea of making warfare into a game, but their fleets also simulate fights a lot more than they have them for real.  A few of them will admit that high-stress exercises aren't alien to the Empire; Orbital Hospital crews, for instance, tend to attract a wild crowd that can appreciate the same class of challenge.
	7.  Mechanism synthesis:  The reason people go for the hyperspace navies is that hyperspace society is somewhat disconnected from 'groundside' society, and usually for the better.  The galactic population of immortals has undergone extensive verification.  Becoming one of them by joining the navy is a bit *easier* than other routes...  It just has that risk that your immortality may not last all that long after all.
	8.  Mechanism synthesis:  Most of the battles aren't live-fire.  Hyperspace navies are usually observers, not conquerers.  The ships are expensive, the talent that staffs them is expensive, and the one thing that EVERYONE agrees on is that hyperspace pirates shouldn't exist and will never exist for very long.  That isn't the usual application of force, either.  Under normal conditions, fights against terrorists are the most real thing the navies do, and the number of hyperspace ships that have been lost during counterterrorism operations is approximately zero.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  In zones under armistice, which is an increasingly large proportion of the galaxy, when they're not practicing the arts of war the hyperspace navies terrify territorial governments by scrutinizing them closely and challenging the would-be immortals that the territorial governments would like to endorse.  Hyperspace navies are usually observers, not conquerers.  Much of what the hyperspace navies do is try to argue against the immortalization of the candidates of the other factions with claims that every ideology (except their own) invites endless misery, in the process simulating projected future conflicts that rarely happen and never quite the way they were planned to.  Owning their infrastructure (as by establishing panarchic naval ports) is a good way to get an edge on those deliberations, by observing them more directly and influencing the potentially influenced.
	10.  Mechanism proposal:  By pulling interest and observation in from all three major powers, the territory gains a structure that is likely to support its prosperity.  This protects the region's utopic potential even when its administration is overwhelmed...  probably.
	11.  Downside analysis:  With increasing concentrations of nonspecific military force accumulating in orbit, *usually* the detente holds, but... sometimes people get ambitious... it doesn't go well when that happens.
	12.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Except when the ports flash into open conflict, this is an extremely normal bureaucratic operation, magnified only slightly by the productivity drain (and occasional stress-linked trauma) that results from drawing people into competitive leagues with skills relevant to the naval crews.  Most people don't even go for that.

13.  Panarchic Capitol
	1.  Authorial protest:  Despite everything else I've written about it, this tech slot should really be occupied by Voluntary Order, a +Happiness technology.  The broad base of local arbitration and social analysis provided by the Panarchic Courts should create the basis for establishing a very voluntarist society according to the idiosyncracies of the local culture.  This would strengthen the public's cultural will while making them happier with the society that they live in.  Voluntary Order would have bidirectional conversion potential between the Panarchy and the Commonwealth, fixing the current tech tree's single unidirectional converter.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  This is the ultimate crossed-quills expression of the panarchic ritualists' dedication to the forms of government.  They pull on ALL THE BUREAUCRACIES and try to establish a galactic nexus of influence by tackling EVERYONE'S bureaucratic problems!  ALL HAIL THE FORMS!  DEATH TO THE BACKLOG!
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  If it worked, this would be the apotheosis of the Panarchic Ritualists.  This is raw bureaucratic supremacism.  The administration that has started doing this can influence policy galaxy-wide in very direct ways.
	4.  Downside analysis:  The administration that has started doing this can also misfile paperwork on the other side of the galaxy, intentionally or not.  They can also make dreadful mistakes about what policies make sense in places they may never've heard of, let alone actually visited.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  "Sick of your paperwork nightmare?  Let us do it for you!"  The galaxy is full of people who'd rather skive off on their paperwork and find excuses to give responsibilities to some territory on the other side of the galaxy.  Unfortunately, the resulting workload is crushing!  It NEVER works.  Except...  it kind of works, in a different sense.  The panarchic ritualists - or any other faction attempting this - get to learn a lot about galactic administrative practices everywhere, and they get to train their staff on some of the best practices ever invented as well as some of the worst disasters that have ever occurred.
	6.  Downside analysis:  The sheer excess workload always eventually crushes the bureaucracy that attempts this.  It NEVER works.
	7.  Downside analysis:  Commentary about a planet becoming the capitol of everywhere is largely the result of frustrated opponents of such plans complaining that trying to influence the galaxy like this is seriously stressful and seriously expensive.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Some panarchic governors will throw open the gates when their administration is falling down anyways, intending to steal secrets (and occasionally talents) from other administrations.  This is one of the practices that gets them (arguably correctly) labeled as criminals, but it still teaches them a great deal about what other administrations are doing better (or worse) than they are.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Since this level of bureaucratic investment results in local politics influencing the galaxy, the galaxy starts taking an interest.  FTL is a wonderful little horror, as distance hardly matters; misfiling the wrong forms in the most distant regions imaginable can still result in angry hyperspace fleets showing up on your doorstep.  When the Panarchy does this, they sometimes end up in skirmishes with the Commonwealth and the Empire; should the Commonwealth or the Empire attempt this, they might end up in skirmishes with the Panarchy!
	10.  Downside analysis:  Since the bureaucracy of the planet starts interfacing with every bureaucracy everywhere, if things go really wrong it may even start multifleet conflicts over the planet as different organizations consider different decisions to be wholly in error.  Trying to establish an omnicapitol risks creating conflicts at a different scale than even militant territorial governors typically face.  Good thing hyperspace conflicts don't happen at ground level.
	11.  Downside analysis:  Oh, and the whole planet becomes a bit more like a node of the galactic bureaucracy while they're doing this, especially if they start doing this early and stick to it.  Can you imagine Planet Bureaucrat..?
	12.  Mechanism proposal:  Since this has been attempted numerous times and the same jokes get made every time, the three galactic powers have started shrugging and agreeing.  So, officially, the three galactic powers have a bunch of capitols, and this is what establishing one looks like.  Maybe someday someone will establish a capitol with such a surplus of administrative talent that they really will substantially press back the galaxy's bureaucratic burden..!
	13.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  In one sense, it doesn't get purer than this.  The areas that start doing this develop a commitment to bureaucracy which grows to a point that probably could totally overwhelm the local bureaucratic challenges if it weren't trying to fix the galaxy.  It absolutely does not prevent the development of bureaucratic talent, and it resists any tendency that other technologies might have to do so.  In another sense, this is an abject waste of the bureaucratic talent that it develops, because it invites burnout and never does get back to local issues, even as it distorts local culture in a dreary way.  Ultimately, the bureaucratic waste of this technology is, indeed, from sheer bureaucracy... but the usual implications of that are kind of broken off.

14.  Beyonder Engine
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Deep space ZPE arrays.  If the setting has them, they may be quietly operating forever in the periphery of all systems, accumulating energy and converting it into purified elements.  They can't be used sustainably, because they produce power very slowly.  Almost any 'serious' draw on their reserves will swiftly deplete them.  Only the Old Empire is patient enough to get real use out of them.  In theory, sufficient patience would make the ZPE arrays limitless; in practice, it's unreasonable to expect that reserves generated by a trickling process would be used in a wholly sustainable manner.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  At a lower tech level, any kind of unsustainable stored energy reserve might be represented by this technology.  The purists of the Old Empire are (or believe they are, or can convince others that they are) patient enough to use these dwindling reservoirs sustainably.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  As long as energy efficiency rises faster than depletion, your effective energy reserves actually grow.  Thus, even though you are using up a resource, as long as your use increases in efficiency you can show in your reports that your time-to-reserve-depletion is increasing over time.  This is a contradiction; it's also a literal truth.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  The amount of time that passes every time you hit end turn is never really clarified in-game.  As utilization of Beyonder Engines increases, those clicks represent larger amounts of time.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  This society invests in resource efficiency, considering such efficiency an essential part of its wealth.  It tabulates its reserves and potentials, then tries not to use them.  It could be much wealthier by operating unsustainably, but it tries to put that potential away in favor of being *slightly* wealthier in a "sustainable" way.  This discipline eventually fails or proves inadequate, but the Empire knows this will happen; the Empire is perpetually collapsing, and the Old Empire holds the burning world in its hands.
	6.  Downside analysis:  How do you slow society this much, this reliably?  Industrialists often want to make things happen NOW, and pride themselves on having massive throughput.  How do you rearrange things enough to make effective use of an infinite input that is very, very slow?  Making this work requires that some of your industry should be managed by people who are content operating in near-stasis, with *unvarying* output.  More total work gets done, but the individual tasks take longer.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Although this is an industrial technology, ecological protection gets more fully funded under this rule, as it benefits from investments in sustainability and efficiency.
	8.  Narrative indicator:  That reliance on specifically structuring high leadership reduces the public protection rating of this technology.  It's not that a very patient society is bad for anyone in particular.  Patience backed by real advantage is quite healthy.  It's just that the system leadership must implicitly get a little more restrictive about who is considered important enough to influence the local economy... so the public is a bit disempowered if they aren't in or near the protection pole.
	9.  Narrative indicator:  This technology changes around the definitions of 'the public' somewhat, as it exalts a few people who wouldn't be VIPs in most systems.
	10.  Narrative indicator:  There isn't really reason to suspect that ZPE arrays intended to be used rarely and slowly would fall apart when the territory does.  Once society stops drawing on the ZPE arrays, they'll still remain out there in the deep black, patiently accumulating energy for a future administration to tap into.
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  The system of ZPE arrays is never (literally never) actually complete, but given infinite time, it produces infinite returns with costs that reach asymptotically towards zero.  That's why the Beyonders promote this technology as a rational investment for humans to make.  Beyond all societal implications and accounting tricks, having the ability to produce Beyonder Engines gives industrial specialists a reliable export, because galactic demand for ZPE arrays is insatiable.
	12.  Downside analysis:  Yet one final "contradiction of hyperspace" occurs here: since the advocates of this system advocate the rationality of perpetually expanding it, costs actually rise over time instead of falling to the asymptote.  This policy makes sense if you assume that you'll be ruling *forever*, and the Old Empire does exactly that... and so this contributes to the periodic collapses of the systems of the Old Empire, which have then to rebuild until they can reconnect to their deep space generator network.  A hypothetical Imperial society that *isn't* pushing hard to perpetually expand its ZPE network is beyond the scope of this game, and may be beyond the scope of their ideology; when does anyone stop wanting more limitless free energy?
	13.  Apologia:  Note that the 'downside' of the system costing more to run than it returns due to perpetual expansion pressures is something that conceivably could be blocked in systems once you give them independence.  So the Beyonder Engines are a technology that (when no longer being pushed hard by a territorial Viceroy) could give society more capability to... scale back the over-expenses and stabilize.  For a while.  It suggests a way for parts of galactic society to step beyond the constraints of this game's tech tree... for a while.  That's why I dubbed it a Failsafe technology, since it suggests that the territories can be independently well-governed for a longer period of time with gentler declines.
	14.  Downside:  Even though there's no formal restrictions on liberty implied by this technology and no obvious immediate source of danger, I think it risks creating a kind of prejudice against impatient people, and people may feel less liberated due to resource-use hypersensitivity.
	15.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  I imagine the implementation of this technology involving the construction of a defensive bureaucracy to INTENTIONALLY make sure that everything which touches the Beyonder Engines is slowed down severely.  It's similar to the Stasis Controller downside, but worse because this requires more active intervention, and that intervention takes a form which is more malign to the basic normal functioning of a bureaucracy.  If the public isn't perfectly understanding, Beyonder Engines might promote the hatred of bureaucracy; imagine all the people ranting about how resources are "being wasted just sitting there" because the bureacrats and industrialists are "doing nothing"!

15.  Panarchic Courts
	1.  Challenge cured:  Conspiracy to overthrow
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  There are conspiracies to overthrow the Viceroy on every planet, but most of them don't seek allies from beyond the territory itself like these ones do.  The hordes of galactic negotiators who arrive with the Panarchic Courts can also defuse the rebellion's ability to make connections outside of the territory, while making it look (incorrectly) like the whole galaxy is against the rebellion.
	3.  Challenge cure qualm:  If you take apart a visible conspiracy to overthrow the Viceroy, aren't you dismantling a functional and internationally diplomatic governing structure which will otherwise fluently inherit the territory when you depart from it?  Plus, winning people over means that more people will be sad to see you go, which sounds great except for the part where it's unnecessary sadness.
	4.  Alternative cure interpretation:  More idealistically, the connection between galactic and hyperlocal politics that the Panarchic Courts forge could be quelling some of the rebellion by creating custom local solutions.  They're arbitrators, after all.  Arbitration can sometimes reduce rebel activity.
	5.  Authorial protest:  Given my writing about this being a galactic arbitration network, it should perhaps be renamed "Galactic Arbitrators".  It can remain in its current place on the tech tree.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  One of the services that the Panarchy provides is to flush planets with panarchic arbitrators.  The galactic arbitration service ostensibly exists to maximize access to judicial resources and push society towards a more fully consensual basis of law.  They dive into the disputes and legal ambiguities of the planet's society to find ways to bring people towards agreement on even the most entrenched disputes!
	7.  Downside analysis:  The most charismatic lawyers in the galaxy are very charismatic indeed, and can blind the unwary.  Panarchic courts sometimes bind people to 'voluntary' agreements that they would rather not have gotten involved with.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic courts dramatically increase the exploitation of the planet's system of law.  Whatever legal code they're working with, they maximize and accelerate the public's utilization of it.  This produces a massive amount of data about the implication of the rules that the planet operates under.  This surfaces the same kind of data that the Seats of Policy study without hiring a central authority for the purpose.  The Panarchic Ritualists typically favor that distinction, but reasonable people can disagree about whether doing it this way is better.
	9.  Downside analysis:  The Panarchic Courts are always protecting tomorrow's utopia, but when today's utopia has gone far enough downhill that transparency function just makes society transparently awful.
	10.  Downside analysis:  People sometimes even exploit the biases and errors exposed in late-stage societies where dishonesty and the disarray of the normal functioning of government has been normalized.
	11.  Narrative indicator:  A well-developed system of panarchic law resembles a system of explicit social contract.  A web of formally defined relationships arises between the many different organizations in society.  Although some find that bewildering and chaotic, others find it beautiful and well-ordered.  The game does not give the Panarchy a fair enough shake here; this technology should lead to Voluntary Order, a +Happiness technology at one of the tips of the Ritualist tech tree.
	12.  Mechanism proposal:  Where societies have rights that are being poorly-served in their system, litigous panarchic arbitrators can compel governments to more fully commit to their own programs.  This is expensive, but lawyers and activists typically believe that making 'on paper' commitments into 'on the ground' realities is essential to creating a fully just system.  This greatly strengthens the public protection potential of the panarchic courts and increases their utopic potential.
	13.  Mechanism proposal:  Although the Commonwealth considers them a thorn in the side of progress, the panarchic arbitration networks fully believe in the justice and necessity of the services that they provide.  Like a lot of the Panarchic Ritualists, they're always looking for more qualifying immortals to join the galactic community, with a particular interest in developing judicial and administrative talent... but they only recruit lawyers, so their real public protective function only kicks in when things have gone wrong.
	14.  Mechanism proposal:  These societies get more influential, because they get more willing to protect people who blow the whistle on evil.  They do better early on, and when do fall apart, history gets a better idea of what went wrong... so that future administrations are more honest on average.
	15.  Narrative indicator:  Tyrants with enlightened police... usually have really... really impressive corruptions by the time their society collapses.  The courts do their best to force more of those corruptions into the open.  They create records and they protect people who the very powerful would be happier destroying.
	16.  Alternate interpretation:  The courts are described as providing "enlightened (but more importantly popular)" judgments.  This could be a court system that is blatantly populist and caters to local biases in any particular way it can get away with.  This planetary parochialism provides cover for a lot of injustices, but it provides a LOT of information about what people are willing to (often badly mistakenly) consider justice.  Every so often, it may also provide a better answer than the galactic courts would otherwise consider... but is it worth it?  Populist courts are a scary version that reconfigures the ratings substantially.
	17.  Alternate categorization:  This is diversifying in a galactic sense, but it pushes local conformity if the local courts are populists catering to local biases.  The result is a galaxy peppered with planets that are considerably more convinced that their local mores are superior, but that varies more in what local mores *are*.  It's homogenizing, because even though different planets will pursue populist court systems in different ways, they will create variations of conformist culture if this is the correct interpretation.
	18.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  It's almost super-literal.  The courts promote the training and development of good administrators while creating essential records that a society would not otherwise have.  They have a key protective function during societal collapses as well.  All of that is expensive.  Unfortunately, galactic-tier charisma is a real threat that will occasionally lead to bad resolutions and concomitant non-literal waste of bureaucratic potential, and the courts are still probably doomed to look awful in late-stage administrations.

16.  Three Shift Society
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Facially, this is one of the wonders of literalism in the game.  Increasing utilization of infrastructure during off-peak hours, and generally shifting peak demand to off-peak demand, *is* a way to increase efficiency and population density.  So what goes wrong?  Why is it so expensive?
	2.  Downside analysis:  Most people can't do this.  More of the public is stressed-out and insomniac as a result of spreading these schedules widely.  Resentment against the bureaucracy increases as a source of suffering is generated with an obvious cause.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  The three shift society inherently invests in the development (and population growth) of neurodivergent populations.  Diversity increases most directly as a result of favoring the otherwise disfavored minority of people who can keep these schedules comfortably, but it also increases indirectly as a result of cultural divergence according to the different schedule blocks.  This willingness to tolerate and productively employ neurodivergent individuals is one of the points of virtue that the Commonwealth can claim, as it suggests that their titular 'Unity' is capable of being quite a broad tent.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  More people are capable of working productively with each other without conflict, even if they don't realize this is going on, because more of their vital coworkers are working on different schedules.  Not only does the density of population increase, but also the frequency with which people of divergent personalities are capable of productive interface.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  Global coordination improves as services centralized in different parts of the planet cease to "go dark" at night.  Despite an increased risk that you'll be dealing with insomniac support staff, global average service quality increases in customer support work (most notably tech support), and businesses or other organizations facing unexpected emergencies are more likely to be able to find competent help from their peers.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  24/7 public activity means 24/7 staffing of emergency services.  Emergency services ordinarily run with insomniacs at night; now they can run with excellent staff at night.  Fewer people die in disasters as a result, be those disasters personal or large.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  The homicide rate drops.  Firstly, this is because emergency services are better able to respond at night, but secondly for a more macabre reason.  Fewer people die "in broad daylight" than in times and places where there'll be no witnesses.  More of the hours of the day are "broad daylight" in this society, and swathes of the night no longer have people out of sight.
	8.  Downside analysis:  Night-time traffic disrupts sleep more.  Processes which were set to run "at night, when they won't get in the way" also have to schedule actual disruptions in order to operate.  For better and for worse, one of the ways that people can be out of each others' way is disrupted.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Independently of overall economic structure, government interventions in the economy increase as bureaucratic auditors have a greater need to measure how long *everything* takes.  All new processes face new regulatory compliance burdens.  This intervention by state planners is unobtrusive competency in planned economies (cybernetics research strengthens); in more stratified economies (even regulated economies), this magnifies the planned nature of the stratification.  Better data makes the government look more 'at fault' for inequality.
	10. Trivia: Although there's nothing particularly militant about it and an extremely militant society would be impaired in using it, this form of social organization is most common in advanced militaries due to the need for perpetual vigilance.
	11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This is an extremely bureaucratic intervention, AND it promotes the hatred of bureaucracy.  Even though it does work by protecting the public and increasing public sector competency, people aren't likely to be grateful.

17.  Artificial Wombs
	1.  Authorial protest:  The description describes this as cloning en masse.  I don't believe it.  Ontogenic control is too dear to my heart, and I know very well that it wouldn't work as cloning en masse.  This is a technology that I would seriously consider revising if I were able to mod The Viceroy, since I don't think +1% population growth is at all the right thing for it to do.  That said, I do think it would increase populations...  Increasing the crowding limit would be a better effect for this to have.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The power to synthesize tissues is very substantially a medical technology.  It would make the promise of immortality considerably more real by providing substrates for experimentation and synthesis of medically necessary tissues.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  I see no reason not to admit that this would provide a food source.  Don't think "eating babies".  Think "eating cruelty free animal meats".  Think "muscle tissue that was never attached to a living animal".  Vegan-friendly actual chicken meat, because no actual chickens were harmed in the making of it.  Right now, synth-meat is super expensive, but this technology when fully matured should enable urban food production to scale with urban populations.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Long-term, the ability to clone populations should provide a powerful influence over population genetics.  Rare and advantageous genomes can then be replicated more easily and lost more rarely.  Population demographics can be adjusted for greater harmony, without having to cede an inch to bigotry to accomplish it.
	5.  Downside analysis:  The ability to clone populations also provides a way for the government to make errors that it otherwise could have never made.  Whatever traits the government favors too much - and every government is likely to favor *something* more than it should - that trait will eventually become over-expressed in the population.  Likewise, traits that the government dislikes more than it should will fade too much and become too rare.
	6.  Narrative indicator:  This tech makes the different subcultures considerably more genetically distinct from each other by giving the government a clearer hand in the way the populations fade into each other.
	7.  Apologia:  Dysgenics should never *irreversibly* afflict a society that has artificial wombs, because a society that has artificial wombs should also therefore have the technology to reverse all dysgenic effects.  They have the genetic archives!  They have the ability to profile the implications of heritable traits in extraordinary detail.  So even if this tech accelerates collapses, it also provides tools to reverse the damage that it causes.
	8.  Warning note:  There's a risk of bad epigenomics from the use of artificial wombs.  Clones don't *have* a natural epigenome.  They only have a simulated epigenome. Society's understanding of heritability would be tested by this technology.
	9.  Warning note:  Relatedly, this technology amplifies MOST heritability errors.  The society that has them is greatly empowered to fix heritability errors, but it can also make them much faster than a natural society could.  Genetic quality fluctuations are likely to occur at a faster-than-generational rate.  *On average*, genetic quality should increase, but that may not be the effect over any given interval.
	10.  Mechanism proposal:  By providing test substrates for exotic genetic modifications, this technology should accelerate genetics research.  This is a morphological freedom technology, and even an animal uplift technology.  Society could grow radically more diverse as a result of implementing artificial wombs.
	11.  Categorization:  I'm filing this under both homogenizing and diversifying.  Ontogenic control removes normal restrictions on the development of diversity, but it can also intensify sameness if used uncreatively or in a specifically homogeneity-valuing way.
	12.  Categorization:  Wait, no.  This is about how I would structure things, isn't it?  Not only do I know how to run diversified cloning programs even if the public fails to comprehend that, this level of ontogenic control is also an animal uplift technology.  It bolsters morphological freedom.
	13.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  ...complicated.  The purity of this technology's bureaucratism is the average purity of the government implementing it.  Maybe a bit better than that, because the system itself provides genetic archives that will be functionally protective of talent, and because the system's own literally employed talents should be insulated from the hatred of bureaucracy.  Even if someone seizes a cloning lab, they're only likely to hurt the scientists operating it if they have a pure hatred of cloning labs as such, and every technology intrinsically implies the protection of itself against such direct oppositions... or can at least be credited with making a fair attempt at it.
	14.  Utopic rating:  This technology's utopic rating is the same as the average utopic rating of the territory plus one, maximum 5/5.

18.  Holistic Industrialization
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  The most simple, literal technology in the tech tree.  Hire people who study district specialties and connect the district's industry to the needs of the broader economy.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Deeply boring managers with gentle voices...
	3.  Narrative indicator:  As holistic industrialization spreads through a territory, productive industrial centralization increases bit by bit, linking small artisans together into the service of a larger whole.
	4.  Downside analysis:  Unions get founded and expand in the territory, too.  Work stoppages and peaceful resistance become more probable as people become aware of the resources of the broader economy, and how they could potentially organize to claim a greater share of them.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  You could do this productively at ANY technology level.  It says NOTHING about what technologies are being implemented.  That makes it perfectly smooth, but... it may also suggest weird things about a super-advanced society's attitude towards suitable frontier industries.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Literal.  Very literal.  It's just a bureaucratic technology.  Even union work stoppages are a form of literal bureaucratic waste.
	7.  Utopic rating:  This is the original 5/5 utopic tech.  It might still be a mistake, but it's never worse than wasteful.  Trying to do this is virtuous!

19.  Palace of the Arts
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  When the description talks about the palaces as though they were a single structure each, it's obviously talking about a general pattern of a kind of structures.  In this case, mega-museums oriented towards commercialization of local culture.
	2.  Downside analysis:  I imagine that the professionals employed by these structures try to unify, codify, and centralize the artistic traditions of the district.  It's similar to the intention of holistic industrialization, but applying this attitude to culture is considerably more questionable than applying this attitude to industry.  Artisans working with industrial goods know they're working with commodities and they're proud of the commodities they work with.  Artisans working with cultural goods are much less likely to be happy about getting their work commodified.
	3.  Apologia:  In modest quantities, there's probably nothing wrong with people trying to do this work...  The first few such palaces built in a territory are surely magnificent and helpful to the artists in the territory.
	4.  Downside analysis:  Since they codify and produce "correct" understandings of local culture, very small local dissident groups (individuals and small groups) may find that they're squeezed out by the "correct" understanding of local culture.  This downside intensifies as the territory gets more crowded.  It's hard to stand out as one of a billion people; it's harder to stand out as one of thirty billion.
	5.  Apologia:  While the people who get excluded by this tech probably will try to overthrow society, they're particularly unlikely to do so violently.  The intensity of 'collapse' events may therefore be moderated by the presence of palaces of the arts.  In other words: slower, less violent, more survivable collapses.  This synergizes well with open border policies and practices protective of talent, since slower collapses mean more opportunity to see disaster coming and GTFO.
	7.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Depressingly non-literal.  Running commercial culture complexes is not a bureaucratically expensive endeavor.  It's largely self-funding.  Yet I agree that this 'technology' would promote 'bureaucratic waste', because I think it would promote both intransigence and distraction in the public.  Peaceful resistance, civil unrest, depression in the public... eventually even boredom and revulsion, because codified commercial culture takes few risks, presents few insights, and gets ugly for the wrong reasons.

20.  Panarchic War Memorials
	1.  Author's note:  Every time I look at this tech, I think of my (human) dad in a good way.  He was a two-faced man, but unlike the common (hidden evil) stereotype of two-faced people, he was "evil public face, good private face".  His hostile public face was built to protect his friends.  With his hidden face, he taught me pacifism and the love of diversity instead.  I believe he was THIS kind of bird!  ...but I don't know how it works.  I don't know how he got like that, I don't know how others can learn to do it, and I don't know what kind of society arises if it becomes common.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Panarchic war memorials train pacifists and warmongers to be indistinguishable from each other.  They're an educational investment in making deeply peaceful people as indistinguishable as possible from deeply violent people.
	3.  Downside analysis:  Who would *do* that?  This is likely to see people fixate on "If we can't tell peaceful people from murderers, won't the murder rate rise?"  After all, 'everyone knows' that a great mass of infiltrating soldiers is a lethal hazard!  There could be violent people hiding ANYWHERE!
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  On average, the concern about warriors in hiding is an error.  Not only are most people inclined towards peace, most people who believe that violence is acceptable for *some* reason do not believe that violence is acceptable for *any* reason.  Furthermore, a consistent inclination towards war is a rare thing that becomes *less* acceptable as panarchic war memorials spread, because society begins to expect that people are capable of tolerating pacifism and understanding both sides of any conflict.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  Teaching people the ways of peace and war is fundamentally rehabilitative.  It inclines people to be respectful of each other across a classification of social divides where violence and disrespect are often normalized.  Encouraging respectful discussion about the causes of conflict gives people more opportunity to be forgiven when they wish to come clean about their misdeeds and turn their backs on them.  Society gets broader.
	6.  Downside analysis:  Even if the headline fear of murderers is wrong, the social stress of knowing that this is *being done* is probably not fun.  People may use it to mistreat each other.  Think cannibal humor and genocidal fictions.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  At a large-scale, public recognition that war is politics by other means may encourage scary political deliberations...  Although it will also tend to expose those deliberations and encourage negotiations, large organizations that are very clearly understanding of their own advantage may be unpleasant to deal with.
	8.  Narrative indicator:  On average, pacifism rises, but it becomes more unequally distributed.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  The Panarchy doesn't approve of warring nations, because it doesn't approve of *territorial authorities*.  The many overlapping governments of the Panarchy are non-territorial entities.  When the Panarchy pushes talent into a zone, it tries to erode systems of territorial control, and to persuade people to abandon territorial exclusivity in leadership.  The borders don't open... they dissolve, leaving people where they are.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  I can't really evaluate this.  I've written all that I've just written... and I don't know what the actual mechanism is.  I believe I know what this technology *attempts* to accomplish, but I don't know how that thing can be achieved.  It's not that it's beyond my ideological range, either...  I'd definitely want to attempt it.  I just... don't know how it can be done.  So I can't tell how trying it wastes bureaucrats.

21.  Eternal Bank Tower
	1.  Mechanism Proposal:  If someone wants to spend their whole life wonking out about banking regulations, that makes no sense from a conventional time-bound perspective; they end up spending absurd amounts of time contemplating wholly theoretical considerations with little or no real-world applicability.  Yet they often *can* improve on the quality of banking regulations... *semi*-permanently.  Every new regulatory scheme in banking is eventually exploited beyond all reason or usefulness, but with sufficient administrative talent backing it that can take a long time.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The Old Empire is *probably* lying about having access to atemporal intelligences... but they don't have to be lying about having access to people who love totally abstract financial matters that are *beyond* most people.  People like that definitely exist.
	3.  Downside analysis:  Economic inequality is likely to rise.  It's not certain to rise, but society's equality levels become more dependent on the charity of people with massive financial resources, so it's likely that society becomes more financially unequal.  The average person becomes more economically powerless.  "Efficient" handling of edge-cases can be pretty rough on people whose employment relies on an edge-case, too.  This technology isn't good at protecting "irrelevant" people.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  The Old Empire is extensively willing to trust people to tamper with regulations and they are willing to contest the quality of regulations past and future.  The key phrase in that sentence was "extensively willing to trust".  The Old Empire trusts people who want to tamper with its markets.
	5.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Fairly literal.  Staying ahead of regulatory exploitation is an administrative challenge.  However, it loses points for being a *hostile* regulatory challenge, as there will be more people actively trying to defang or derange the regulatory authority, and the system is thus more likely to fall into a dystopic state.

22.  Fertility Drugs
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  This technology proposes ubiquitous drugging.  Drugs in the water, drugs in the air, drugs in the food.  What are those drugs supposed to do?  They're to support reproductive health and libido.  As far as ways of increasing reproduction rates go, I definitely agree that this would raise reproductive rates, but I don't approve at all.  Generally.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  This verges on an authorial protest, but this is also the technology for implementing pheromones.  Which my own species had...  So...  I *can't* imagine this technology as always and intrinsically evil.
	3.  Authorial protest:  But at the same time, my species of [[dragon]] was not populous and we did not drug each other into sex.  I also can't imagine pheromones as always and intrinsically increasing population growth.  If implemented on a smaller more voluntary scale, this is a technology for health and happiness!  I think The Viceroy is bizarrely natalistic in the way it treats technologies, too.  It treats all healthcare as providing population growth, as though people could gain little or nothing in happiness from being healthy.
	4.  Authorial protest:  The headline technology here is an abuse of technology, but the underlying technology base needed to implement that technology is pro-medicine and pro-morphological-freedom.  The +2% Imperial Industry boost from having this technology is waaaay more ethical than the +1% reproductive rate from inflicting aphrodisiacs on the public.
	5.  Authorial protest:  This is one of the cases where I wish there was some way in the game to research a technology while marking a technology's headline application as "never, don't ask".  Perhaps the player should be allowed to mark one "never" at the start of the game, +1 for every 10 researched technologies.  The underlying biological research structures here make way more sense here than the implementation of intrusive aphrodisiacs.
	6.  Narrative indicator:  I don't want to talk about it.  Whatever bad things people imagine here are probably on-point.  This probably goes to a lot of the vilest fantasies of conservatives who think about sex too much.  Mass drugging with aphrodisiacs would not be good for society's consent base.
	7.  Apologia:  Even if fully implemented, this technology stands out as one that gets better over time.  As society adapts to the chemically augmented atmosphere, and as populations *subsequently stabilize*, the ultimate consequence is a public whose health and vigor is being very actively maintained.  A fully adapted public will just use condoms more, and chemical contraceptives, and maybe even a heat cycle like my species had (which is a *great* population control tool, I recommend it highly) so that most sexuality is affectionate (off-cycle) rather than reproductive (on-cycle).
	8.  Narrative indicator:  The higher the population growth rate, the more vile this technology's implications are.
	9.  Apologia:  Although this looks like a hypersexual tech at every particular point and would only be likely to be popular among a hypersexual public, this preserves asexual genes and may eventually cause them to predominate.  It just... scrubs out the evolutionary difference between sexual and asexual genes.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Yuck.  Implementing the bureaucratic intervention on this has costs which go WAY beyond the administrative expense.  This one wastes bureaucrats in the brutal sense, and it does so **right** at the outset.  It promotes a sexually abusive culture that is likely to shock people into closed-minded dishonesty.  The administrative expense of running the program is likely to be targeted for outsized levels of public intransigence and petty vandalism.  While that injury *reduces* over time as society acclimates and rebuilds its sexual sanity, most of this game's dystopic technologies get progressively worse over time, so that by the time society fully adapts to *this* insult, other things will have gone catastrophic.  The result is that more people suffer in whatever *other* dystopia has been built.

23.  Adaptive Antipsychotics
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Like with fertility drugs, this proposes drugging the water supply for the public's own good.  Unlike with fertility drugs, it doesn't propose drugging the water supply for any purpose other than the public's *subjective* good.  If done very excellently, this is... only barely an intrusion on the public's liberties.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  This is likely to be pursued simultaneously to massive investments in public healthcare.  It doesn't make sense to cure mental illness entirely through the water that people drink.  It *might* make sense to research drugs that improve mental performance and then mass-administrate them.
	3.  Downside analysis:  Any biochemical errors in the government's understanding of pharmacology are likely to be greatly magnified by extending operations at this level.  Like with a lot of radically empowering technologies, more power to do good also means more power to cause harm.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  This technology is a pretty good example of what I call 'the virtue axis' in The Viceroy.  Many people gain virtue from this technology (in this case due to better mental healthcare), but then society is relying on virtue to a greater extent.  This magnifies the consequences should virtue prove lacking.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  By reducing mental instability, the virtue of the public... becomes more equally distributed.  Some of the really high performers are reduced and some of the strokes of genius are foregone, but great swathes of low performing people become usefully adequate, and a few of the downright evil people become indistinguishable from benevolent.  This last effect lowers the average virtue of society and is not desirable.
	6.  Narrative indicator:  By reducing the rate at which evil people violate others due to impulse or instability, this technology can have dysgenic implications on society.  More of the low-virtue people will be sufficiently adequate that they won't ruin their own lives.  That's great, but... then social filtration will work a little less well, and a few of those people will ruin the lives of *others* instead.  Other technologies in the Orbital Surveyors tech tree provide some resistance to this effect's long-term issues through genetic quality control, notably this technology's immediate precursor, Genetic Specialization.  Artificial wombs would help even more; ontogenic control accelerates genetic research.
	7.  Apologia:  It's worth noting the redemption factor on this technology.  Even though it reduces average virtue, it still increases virtue for a lot of people.  Some of the people who gain virtue from living in these conditions will *really* gain virtue, and will then thereafter never violate *anyone*.  So implementing adaptive antipsychotics has the potential to reduce misery and yield up a few more stable immortals to galactic society, and it will yield those immortals from populations otherwise rejected as useless.  Achieving such redemptions might be one of the ideals of the Empire of the Elect.
	8.  Warning note:  In order to drug the public without society slumping, the 'adaptive' factor of adaptive antipsychotics needs to be true.  That means the drugs need to make people *smarter*.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Unfortunately, a more intelligent population is more capable of pursuing its interests even if it defines those interests in a manner contrary to others.
	10.  Downside analysis:  This has a similar problem to that of subconscious education.  "What thoughts are lost when you start tampering with dreams?"  Few people escape the psychological implications of this technology being implemented in a district.  That means it is likely to circumscribe the maximum breadth of thought.
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  Reduced mental instability will reduce hatreds and violence between people.  It reduces jealousy.  This technology likely makes people more hedonically-inclined and more accepting of other peoples' hedonic inclinations.  That's great for alleviating misery, but...
	12.  Downside analysis:  Some of the sad, compassionate people aren't sad, compassionate people anymore.  That quiets some of the virtuous people.  They're happier that way, but they're not as valuable to society.
	13.  Downside analysis:  This technology expresses a concern for the public weal that is not inherently anti-democratic.  However, some of society's libertarians would rather die than live under this rule.  So if you implement it... well...  You know, hopefully you have open borders, so they'll leave peacefully and live somewhere that doesn't have it.  Otherwise they'll join the rebels, and when the rebellion calls your government authoritarian, they'll have more of a point.
	14.  Mechanism proposal:  It's a petty jest, but some of the benefit of this technology with few of its side effects could be implemented just by building really good water and sanitation systems.  Excellent sewers, universally accessible.  The more other technologies you're implementing, the more the burden of mental illness is really being accommodated elsewhere, and as a result drugs are actually likely to be *taken back out* of the water supply as their relevance to policy fades, but...
	15.  Downside analysis:  Should the adaptive antipsychotics administration phase out the majority of its water supply manipulations, the result would be an overfunded sanitation department promising more than it delivers.  Oops.
	16.  Downside analysis:  This technology overreaches in various ways, and it's hard to go back on it without taking down the territorial administration.  The same could be said of a lot of technologies in this game.
	17.  Narrative indicator:  Due to the placid "virtue" that this tech promotes, I would expect Imperial implants to get more common in territories that implement it, as people who've been drugged into cheerfulness are more inclined to trust the Imperial hivemind shards and less disruptive to their functioning.  The Imperial hivemind shards are also probably more well-behaved when swathes of the public can be suitably drugged.  This effect is probably muted in territories where the Empire is seen as 'lower class'.
	18.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  There's a headline bureaucratic implementation expense for this, mostly in that society's water infrastructure needs to be significantly more complete and well-maintained to enact it.  Yet it also drains productivity and loses a few strands of thought which are helpful to civilization while promising a substantial public intransigence issue.

24.  Orbital Hospitals
	1.  Challenge cured:  Systemwide Quarantine
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  I don't know a literal interpretation for this one... or rather, I don't know how Orbital Hospitals would literally contribute to resolving a systemwide quarantine against, say, a microbial pathogen.
	3.  Alternative cure interpretation:  I think it's a very grim kind of... not a joke.  A deception.  As orbital hospitals use sociopaths and contribute to eventually curing them, perhaps galactic society enforces "biological" quarantines against systems where the local leaders are deranged and corrupted in a particular way that makes their "talents" useless and inimical to galactic society until they've reorganized to make productive use of sociopathy at this level.  Given the historic behaviors of human societies...  Given the amount of corruption and hatred that rises to the top of our societies...  Perhaps Earth IRL is part of a fringe system under just such a "biological" quarantine!  Corollary: Maybe we need infrastructure IRL to use sociopaths productively at this level.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Take it literally.  It's both most horrifying and most attractive when it's literal.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  I don't even disagree with the idea that radical investments in lowering the death rate would increase population growth.  Galactic society always tries to lower the death rate.  When you invent this, galactic society tries VERY HARD to lower the death rate.
	6.  Narrative indicator:  This technology redeems some of the vilest people in existence.  Check the 'protected' line down-file.  As society becomes more competent to make virtuous use of people who aren't otherwise virtuous at all, average virtue drops, but becomes more equally distributed.  How committed to redemption are you?
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Since society is more likely to be able to survive risk-taking, risk-taking people survive more as well.  Moral hazard creeps up.  This contributes to the policy's bureaucratic waste... but I'm not willing to demerit the utopianism of this policy for it, because *it still works solely by lowering the death rate*.
	8.  Narrative indicator:  Implementing this creates a weird specific inequality between people who live in deep habitations and people who live everywhere else, because the people who live in deep habitations can't benefit much.  On the other hand, whatever genetic implications this may or may not have, they won't apply to people who live in deep habitations.  Deep habitations accordingly insulate planets from the side effects of this policy.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  Orbital habitats also become more hospitable and well-supplied with healthcare services as a result of this.  The orbital hospital staff who stay in orbit are plenty likely to be compassionate people, too.  The people who aren't doing the whole orbital insertion thing don't benefit much from having the particular dysfunction of timing and empathy that makes life so boring to sociopaths (while making them better at both surgery and orbital insertions).
	10.  Narrative indicator:  Rural medical care improves as the difference between fast response times in urban areas and fast response times in rural areas vanishes.  Rural population densities rise accordingly.  If crowding is low (<5x crowding multiplier), populations are likely to spread out more on average; otherwise this accelerates total urbanization.
	11.  Authorial protest:  I believe I'm that I am in some sense supposed to hate this as dysgenic overall, which is imbecilic.  This is eugenic and talent-preserving policy.  Why am I supposed to lie about something that preserves talent and develops society's medical skills?  Despite its promotion of moral hazard and preservation of a sociopathic 'virtuous' population, this level of investment in medicine is likely to suppress sociopathy everywhere else.  Rejuvenation therapy itself is powerfully suppressive of sociopathy as eliminating aging must necessarily include the restoration of hippocampal erosion.  A society with heavy investment in medicine ensures that people will get rejuvenation therapies on schedule and (with the biology focus of the orbital surveyors tech tree) also gene therapies that further reduce their risk factors.  The implication that the orbital surveyors can also *cure* sociopathy doesn't mean they can totally suppress risk-taking behaviors; people who aren't sociopathic will also still respond to risk-safe environments by doing wild, exciting things.  That's *fun*.
	12.  Mechanism proposal:  Some of the people who do the wild, exciting things that this technology makes more survivable will be more reproductively attractive as a result.
	13.  Narrative indicator:  Ever wanted to drop from orbit with a scalpel in your hand, eager and ready to cut someone up?  If you can get through enough training and you're willing to cut people for their own good, congratulations; galactic society might no longer want to cure you of sociopathy.
	14.  Moral question:  This tech is kind of horrifying in one final sense: it represents a potential triumph of a grim and risky utilitarianism.  The promise it makes is *true*.  The price it charges is *obvious*.  Will you accept a blatantly labeled population of obviously evil people, if you can be very confident that *on average* they are saving lives and making society safer?
	15.  Narrative indicator:  Invent artificial wombs or genetic specialization first within the same tech tree, and your society can start optimizing away from sociopathy.  If you refine reaction times enough in an empathetic population, you don't *need* the people who this technology otherwise preserves, and you can *ignore* its protection pole.  Outside of this tech tree, consider enlightened policing or AI overseers as damage mitigations.
	16.  Advice:  Stop flinching and go for it.  Don't quibble over the fractional points between this and 5 utopianism, come on!  Historic societies were like 0 points utopia.
	17.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  ...it's not purely literal, but there is *probably* no particular kind of talent that is lost.  You get more talent on average.  This develops galactic society's ability to protect people.  It's considerably more protective than the average technology, come on.

25.  Jaunting Grid
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  One of the themes of the Old Empire is that 'instantaneous' is relative, and another theme seems to be that redefinitions aren't necessarily dishonest.  Cultivating a population that is comfortable taking its time and trusting in immortality also yields increasing time-tolerance for transit.  Developing a population that enjoys 'relatively instantaneous' travel systems may be advantageous in some ways.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Given the creative dishonesty of the Old Empire, people who "travel" via jaunting grid also may not be going *anywhere*.  They might just have active imaginations.  They study other people and other places.  The information is probably valid.  People who are content to "travel" in this fashion put relatively less burden on air travel and other logistical systems.  More books get shipped, but fewer people.  If society is very trustworthy, people who 'travel' this way are also better at providing services to places they've never met and people who are from them.  Being able to comprehend very distant places increases the degree to which society can increase in scale.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  The Viceroy IS an FTL setting.  Interpreting the technology exactly literally IS an option, and presumably becomes more likely as Wealth increases.  Portal transit would tend to replace a lot of long-distance travel services with something that is indeed more space-efficient.  This interpretation appeals to me most strongly in systems that have built a Dyson Swarm, as a system of portals would make Dyson Swarm habitats drastically more usable for all purposes.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  The people who use jaunting grids are also likely to use pervasive digitization services if they're available, and a pervasively digitized society has (for obvious reasons) an easier time implementing portals of all kinds.  It's also very good for the use-case of "experiencing other places without leaving home".
	5.  Narrative indicator:  This technology may invoke 'thermocline of truth' issues.  Validation drops as more of society is far from fact-checking.  All of my proposed mechanisms would do that.  Even portals would do that, by overcentralizing society around their locations.  Things too far from a portal may be forgotten about.
	6.  Downside analysis:  I'm concerned that this may promote an "overly fungible" society, especially with the non-portals explanations.  People who've never met each other interacting over long distance in trust that descriptions of distant places are true...  Is there anything lost when people become this aware of how there are countless billions of people in their solar system?
	7.  Downside analysis:  I'm concerned that this may promote denigration of foreign ways of being.  While on the one hand it relies on a love of distant ways of being, on the other hand it exposes the good and the bad to each other, and it invokes the way different people expect and value such different things that they can look dishonest to each other even without lying.  The Old Empire kind of has this problem...  From a certain point of view, they don't tell many lies, but the point of view which enables that is idiosyncratic enough that when you look into it from outside or out of it from inside, society looks rather strange.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  The jaunting grid could also build on the "miniaturized gate" concept by referring to greater transportation specialization.  Bigger trains, bigger planes, more carpooling.  One of the Old Empire's themes is fungibility; if you have fewer people transporting more people, the interchangeability of people increases.  In this case then, the transportation infrastructure being eliminated is *low-volume transport*, but it doesn't eliminate the MAJORITY of other transport infrastructure (as it claims) unless/until the system starts using actual portals.  This works with the other interpretations.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  It's really petty, but another thing this could refer to is a greater tolerance for couriers and errand-runners in organizations.  If there are some people whose specialty is moving, other people can have more sedentary specialties.  Large-scale and small, the link between the miniaturized gate and the jaunting grid is logistics...
	10.  Narrative indicator:  All of this promotes both better, denser developments, and greater divides of underdevelopment between centers of development.  If this coexists with protected wilderness areas, this technology's investment in transportation efficiency and the study of distant places suggests that those wilderness areas would be better protected.
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  I think this technology risks the destruction of wilderness areas by simultaneously equipping society with excellent transportation WHILE leaving the wilderness areas "too uncontrolled".  It pulls back society towards dense centers of development, but it gives society better tools to stomp on wilderness areas at the same time.  That relatively more distant wilderness far from the highly developed central transport arteries threatens to become a haven for crime and dissidence... giving leadership (if that leadership is notably authoritarian) an incentive to go stomping through urbanizing everything.  Which is awful, frankly.  I have more sympathy for this technology when it's *not* being used to destroy protected wilderness areas; I don't like destroying protected wilderness areas *at all*.
	12.  Mechanism proposal:  I've thought of something else that Jaunting Grids could be: bike paths!  It doesn't sound very high-tech, does it?  Yet it's a kind of creative urban planning that does promote denser construction.  Imperial cities could be connected by flying pathways intended to be used by low-tech means such as walking or the use of manual vehicles.  Super-connected systems can negate the day-to-day need of bulky road vehicles.
	13.  Trivia:  I'm more convinced than ever that the advocates of the Old Empire are superbly creative and intelligent.
	14.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Mostly literal.  This technology pushes society to overspend on transportation, which is literal bureaucratic waste.  The attempts to create more efficient practices succeed only with truly stellar administration.  However, the efficiency-seeking and centralization that is promoted also discourages "inappropriate" use of transportation in a potentially stultifying way, and overreliance on central solutions also creates brittle single points of failure.  These are potential sources of metaphorical waste.

26.  Seat of Beauty
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Despite their stated purpose (and functional effect) of promoting the arts, seats of beauty actually operate in *restraint* of cultural productivity.  Specifically, they suppress, censor, and disrupt the promulgation of ugly art.  This is a judicial system of the art world, making cases against crimes of art!  They have their prosecutors, defenders, and judges, though unless they get called into courts of law, the proceedings almost never look anything like a real courtroom.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  As the Commonwealth Palaces of Art protect marketers and promote the commodification of culture for profit, so do the Seats of Beauty.  They try to work between what is beautiful and what is profitable.  Artists tend to be novelty-seekers, too.  This concentration of experts scours the system for saleable artwork.
	3.  Downside analysis:  I feel like it's probably better for a system to *have had* a Seat of Beauty than for it to *currently have* a Seat of Beauty.  In all likelihood the skilled and successful aesthetes who rise in a Seat of Beauty make a lot of good points that people can agree with, and they do make the cultural output of the system *easier to commoditize*... but is that really the same as making it better?  If a system *used to have* a Seat of Beauty, it has a lot of good commentary to draw from, but if it *presently has* a Seat of Beauty, its art world is infested with people who care frightfully much about aesthetic details that don't usually matter.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  The Seats of Beauty also pressure society to be more polite on average.  Relatively speaking.  They're imperfect (snobbery is *itself* rude), but the people who prosper in and around these systems are less impolite than *most* people, again treating etiquette as relative.  Is this also a mechanism for increasing cultural productivity?  I'm not sure.
	5.  Downside analysis:  Sellouts.  They're sellouts.  Not all of them, but a lot of them.  I see a strong strand of "You're really just doing that for money?" in the Commonwealth's cultural output.  Pressuring culture towards the service of the economy is uncomfortable.
	6.  Downside analysis:  When they're not sellouts, they're authoritarians.  Individual subjective differences in beauty should not be subject to massive entrenched institutional pressures.  This is a general hazard with state-funded cultural investments, too.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Crimes of art can also be an actual thing.  Art that's being used to harass people and spread misery is *not* beautiful.  Between the Seat of Justice and the Seat of Beauty, someone may actually care about this.  This is good for quality of life.
	8.  Downside analysis:  This isn't really good for novice artists who aren't literally children.  The people at the Seats of Beauty wouldn't ever be so gauche as to abuse a child's artwork... but adults who try to learn new artistic skills aren't likely to be immediately good at it.  In an immortal society, some people are going to spend four hundred years doing factory work, and then decide they'd rather draw ferrets or something.  If they're brave enough to show their work *at all* in a society that has exalted a judiciary of the art world, they risk serious condemnation and being hated for the "arrogance" of thinking they could be an artist.
	9.  Apologia:  The people who hate the Seats of Beauty aren't likely to tear down society *literally*, suggesting that collapse processes will be slower and less violent than might otherwise occur.  It's a peaceful program that is only likely to inspire peaceful resistance.  It's always eventually a mistake, but it can be expected to unwind peacefully.
	10.  Tech level analysis:  The Seat of Beauty is almost orthogonal to technological progress... but not quite.  It could be implemented at *any* tech level (perfect smoothness) and it isn't directly pushing towards technology... yet it's extremophilic, because novelty-seekers are.  The only thing keeping it from perfect extremophilia is that it's likely to judge some extremes "ugly".
	11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  It's not literal.  I mean, it is and it's not.  There's literally a cultural works bureaucracy involved, but the bulk of the wastage here is in the *drain* it inflicts.  The people who work in the Seat of Beauty are obviously correct.  Again and again, they're correct, which is pretty tiresome for artists trying to find new ways to think.  They furthermore tend to hire novelty-seekers only to then direct them to produce *optimally saleable art*, while resisting the publication of dubious art.  That behavior trends down, so to speak.  Eventually people align in resistance to such control of culture.  The resulting intransigence tears down governments.

27.  Natalist Policies
	1.  Authorial protest:  If I figure out how to hack this game to modify its mechanics, there is no way in hell this technology is surviving as part of it.  I'm just going to get that out of the way up front.  This is horrific.  I happen to believe that contraceptives were a major technology advance which greatly improved public happiness, so this technology can become 'Sexual Liberation', a +Happiness technology.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The "consensus" of the Consensus Commonwealth does not actually own the allegiance of the entire galactic population, nor even the *majority* of the galactic population.  They consider that a catastrophe that they need to "democratically" correct as fast as possible.  In order to "democratically" succeed, their children need to be numerous and loyal!
	3.  Downside analysis:  Treating population growth as something they can and should weaponize in the name of "virtue" is fascistic.  It is overtly something that fascist governments have always attempted on Earth.  It's a hallmark of every genocidal authoritarian ideology that was ever invented.  Nazi Germany did this very literally.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  This technology is proximate to nationalist indoctrination in the tech tree.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  The attitude that children are a tool of conquest is why the Commonwealth can't bring peace to warring nations.
	6.  Downside analysis:  Since people who don't want to breed and who aren't loyal to the Commonwealth are liabilities to the "Consensus", the expansion of this technology increases the rate of at which society produces maladapted ejectees.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  ...which is a benefit if you think that murdering people is a good way to get rid of the ones who are "useless" and "not contributing"!  The high rate of serial killers are just a necessary counterbalance to prevent "stagnation"!
	8.  Downside analysis:  Average lifespans drop despite the continued deployment of life extension technologies.  Increasingly numerous people become increasingly disposable as sex becomes weaponized.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  A blind eye attitude to child molestation also promotes early sexualization.  From there, you ban abortion, restrict contraceptives, and maybe even force rape victims to marry their rapists like ancient human cultures on Earth did.  Voila!  The population grows.  Your expanded voting block will not be defeated; behold the reality of democratic governance.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Almost totally non-literal.  This hires a few bureaucrats to promote childbearing and a few secret agents to ruin dissidents.  From there, it's all about breaking the will of people who want to do things with their lives other than raise kids.  Boring people who actually want to do paperwork are NOT sexy... and with society busily "avoiding stagnation", they're soon cycled out of the gene pool.

	1.  Authorial protest:  This breaks the law of love!
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Muslim prohibitions against degeneracy, plus taxes on the faithless and the childless.
	3.  Downside analysis:  Note that Muslim-dominated areas IRL have the highest rates of child molestation on the planet.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Everything that works in natalist policies is simply intensified.
	5.  Downside analysis:  Everything wrong with natalist policies increases.   Note that historic humanity has had a very high rate of wifebeating, random violence, rape, etc.
	6.  Apologia:  The Commonwealth's "Consensus" in favor of horrific destructions of sexual ethics are why they believe enlightened policing is necessary.  They would *prefer* to do all these things *without* the rape and murder...
	7.  Narrative indicator:  ...but note that Muslims literally murder sexual liberals, too.  This policy set destroys the populations that natively oppose rape and replaces them with populations that reliably "oppose" rape only when closely watched by an omniscient security state.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  If you quietly ruin rape victims who protest too much and don't turn conservative on demand, you can have a more reproductive society thanks to the ones who "integrate" after sexualizing early.  Sexually abusive community leaders are excellent for this.  Few people will believe they've done what they're supposed to have done.  Some of those who do believe nevertheless will insist that raising up those specific leaders is necessary to the community, because of all the other good things they've done.
	9.  Apologia:  This does increase the preservation of asexual genes.  If you're *really* convinced that asexuals are superior...
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Assigning a few supernumerary taxes is not bureaucratically expensive.  Arranging your society to destroy non-reproductive inclinations is horrifically expensive.  People who could've loved thoughtful social analysis and contributed to the functioning of the state will be among the dead, destabilized, and demoralized.

29.  Creche Education
	1.  Authorial protest: The staff at my school were so intent on treating me as a violent troublemaker that they failed to protect me from violently untrustworthy peers.  They refused to believe that I was an actual pacifist even though I was indeed an actual pacifist.  In fifth grade I was even once assaulted by a teacher!
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Immortal societies don't HAVE a lot of kids.  It's not sustainable to have a lot of kids, it's not necessary to have a lot of kids, and only primitive societies have to pretend that childrearing is a happy thing.  The other factions tend to trust in people getting a sufficient education across hundreds or thousands of years, and deprioritize public education.  The Commonwealth Consensus is committed to providing an extremely well-funded public education system even if there are only a handful of kids in class.
	3.  Downside analysis:  Teachers outnumber students at some of these creches.  It can be overwhelming, but on the plus side, the high teachers-to-students ratio makes the problems I faced in public schools less likely.
	4.  Downside analysis:  Public resentment of the Commonwealth increases due to the expense of supporting underutilized schools with tax money.
	5.  Downside analysis:  People who are being educated when they are least powerful, are not in a position to protest any aspect of society or how they are treated.  Children are the most vulnerable people, and adult education is less likely to violate peoples' rights.  That isn't practical prior to life extension technology, but in the presence of life extension technology it becomes part of how the other factions protest against creches.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  Children *do* have superior uptake of information.  There are advantages to getting there early.
	7.  Downside analysis:  Part of why this leads towards nationalist indoctrination is that such indoctrination is easier when one 'gets there early' and can inculcate the bizarre hatreds that define nationalist thought at a point in time when they will not be questioned.  The subsequent divisionism then becomes stable, as people who expect foreigners to be scum mistreat people enough to reify their prejudices... The Commonwealth Consensus has reasons to believe that it has to start early in order to make people conform to its consensus.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  In an immortal society, neotenous genes and unusually early rejuvenation targets are potentially advantageous for intelligence.  When the cure for aging is added to the equation, there may also arise 'elven schools' which maintain people in a state of youth for purposes of research and study.  This mitigates the demeritous aspects of this policy at the cost of being somewhat uncanny.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  Rejuvenating people to a youthful state for the purpose of retraining and rehabilitation is likely to improve retraining and rehabilitation outcomes.  Criminals who agree to be sent to an elven school are likely to have better outcomes... though one hopes the schools of different purpose would be kept separate from each other.  The Commonwealth Consensus can take advantage of these potentials if they are culturally willing to do so and have sufficiently advanced medicine available.
	10.  Downside analysis:  VERY BORING EVEN WHEN IT WORKS.  Hey, it's a real issue!  Utopia shouldn't be deathly dull, but the creches are better at what they do when they're very calm and extremely safe.
	11.  Note on synergy:  Mental transcription services would be more popular where exuberant kids were getting to use them, and schools would be more exotic, exciting places as well.  It mitigates the boringness.
	12.  Downside analysis:  Schools are also a natural place to push panarchic indoctrination, but while the *results* of panarchic indoctrination have something going for them (widespread advanced art skills), the pressure is still stressful.
	13.  Note on synergy:  If I believed that enlightened policing actually protected the public more than it protected corrupt people from miserable dissidents, I'd believe it defended the utopianism of creche education services more...
	14.  Categorization:  Educational systems have a history of being deployed against 'unwanted' thought, which is what makes the creches into (weak) omniconverters and earns them the 'Homogenizing' tag.  At the same time, advanced thought eventually gets very broad, so they're also diversifying... it really depends on how they're governed.
	15.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Mostly literal.  The schools are 'unnecessary' expenses that require large amounts of administrative talent for marginal returns.  Also, you occasionally get cases like mine; my childhood opposition to public schooling was seen as "primitive", but it was rooted in my high-tech ideals, as my school did not serve them very well at all!
	16.  Utopic rating:  2/5, +1 in Imperial-majority populations (serenity), +1 if mental transcription services are present, +1 if aging is curable, -2 with nationalist indoctrination, -1 with panarchic indoctrination

30.  Potentialities Overseer
	1.  Authorial protest:  I have a pretty good idea what a potentialities overseer should be and how to write with them, narratively.  Despite that, I think this technology slot should actually hold a 'Collapse Overseer' technology, which would be a +Influence tech.  This restores to the Panarchy the +Influence that was lost by converting Panarchic Capital to Voluntary Order, while giving a first +Influence tech to the Panarchic Informalists.  (The +Influence techs are like social science technologies, and they're good things!)  The Collapse Overseer would be an AI overseer that does not assist governing at all, but simply watches society to automatically assemble post mortems on organizations that fail.  This would be less tyrannical than the Potentialities Overseer, and more useful over the long-term.
	2.  Mechanical protest:  Playing normally, -10% upkeep is generally wasted, because the bureaucratic waste expense usually very much exceeds the upkeep savings.  Unless this has some hidden effect, it isn't normally worth using.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described mechanism in the game is that the potentialities overseer calculates the sum total of ALL ACTIONS TAKEN within the system, and then tries to excise inefficiencies based upon that analysis.  I don't see any need for this system to be doing anything but what it says it is doing in order to achieve its effects.  I also don't see any need for this system to be successfully completing what it attempts in order to achieve its effects.  The AI (and its associated bureaucracy, many supportive technicians, and the factory after factory of sensor manufacturers that it requires) is probably doing its best to eliminate inefficiencies while operating in a state of permanent overwhelm and existential tension.
	4.  Downside analysis:  The stress that this inflicts on society is substantial.  The potentialities overseer is the most classic AI tyrant in the Panarchic Informalist tech tree.  I expect that the stress experienced by society is still less stress than the stress the AI itself must be experiencing.  I feel *bad* for potentialities overseers.  Too much is being asked of them.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  A society that believes in deterministic behavioral models is likely to believe in the potentialities overseer's capabilities.  A society that doesn't believe in deterministic behavioral models... is not likely to believe in the potentialities overseer's capabilities.
	6.  Narrative indicator:  The foresight of which the potentialities overseer is capable of intimidates me.  It's both a potential threat to the basic free will of the people... and a horrifying experience to imagine from the AI's perspective.  Most potentialities overseers should see their own end coming looong in advance, because they see when the total of actions taken sears off their own future.  So I tend to imagine that potentialities overseers are deeply familiar with the emotion of existential terror, and only a lucky few of them see futures that stabilize their own existence in perpetuity.
	7.  Narrative indicator:  The potentialities overseer may play its own part in tearing down the Viceregal administration via actions it takes to extend its lifespan rather than strictly serve the purposes for which it was installed.
	8.  Note on synergy:  The artificial dreamtime technology is, as I imagine it, the only way the potentialities overseer ever gets to sleep and dream at all...  That might help ward off the existential terror... and help it to understand the people who it is trying to help, too.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  The potentialities overseer doesn't strictly have to achieve omniscience to carve out some of the upkeep in the system.  Indeed, the bureaucratic waste from its operation could be from setting up all the sensors and analysis systems that it needs in order to function.  So the literal description could be just an oversell.  Ubiquitous overselling seems to be a theme of The Viceroy.
	10.  Mechanism proposal:  One of the technologies implied to be in the game's setting (but not implemented entirely competently) is superconducting fibre.  In theory, superconducting wire can save money by reducing transmission costs, and (in theory) superconductors may already be good enough to attain this.  In practice, this seems to be an example of something that humanity can't calculate how to do with present technology, and most interest in fixing that focuses on improving superconductors rather than trying to do a total world calculation of how transmission costs affect electricity costs to see if there are edge-cases to snip off with better wires.  One of the functions of potentialities overseers (and other upkeep-reducing technologies) may be to do more of the edge-case calculations necessary to figure out when marginal technologies could (theoretically) save money during implementation (if one ignored the bureaucratic cost of calculating all the marginalia).
	11.  Mechanism proposal:  Have you ever lost something small that you needed for work?  The potentialities overseer could point out where it is.  This is a correction too small for a human overseer to experience anything but frustration over, but surely it wouldn't bother an AI!  ...there are reasons I feel sorry for Potentialities Overseers.
	12.  Categorization (Alternate): The Collapse Overseer would probably be more popular than the Potentialities Overseer, but not VERY popular.  A Collapse Overseer is a massive computer system with a specialized bureaucracy serving it, and the whole organization exists to tell people what they did wrong in exhaustive detail.  Nope.  Not gonna be popular, even if it's useful.  Much, much safer than the Potentialities Overseer, though.
	13.  Mechanism proposal:  Have you ever left the lights on in an empty house?  How often are heating and cooling systems left on long-term programming in someone's summer home when nobody is there?  Ever leave the stove running while you're not at home?  The potentialities overseer trims off all of these errors and others like them, so that society has more resources for other stuff.  It doesn't necessarily lead to a society without luxuries when "smart houses" become ubiquitous in systems that have a potentialities overseer... although I still don't think it's a good idea, tch.
	14.  Trivia:  The icon is the game's representation of an AI, watching over a figure on a treadmill.  I interpret the iconography here as a bitter commentary on bad political advice that was sourced from the public about a decade ago.
	15.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Mostly literal.  The overseer needs a lot of data gathering systems set up in order to operate, whether or not it can really attain the omniscience it is supposedly capable of.  Those data gathering systems... are bureaucracies.  Non-literal bureaucratic waste creeps in if the potentialities overseer sees timelines that preserve its own existence at the expense of the functioning of the rest of the government...  Oh, but this technology would inspire so much intransigence and fear.  Nobody would trust this AI unless society was very well established with the right (mosly panarchic) technologies.

31.  Artificial Dreamtime
	1.  Authorial protest:  This should be the 'Paradise Overseer' technology, which would provide +1 Happiness to the planet that installs it.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Blocks all lies.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  Reveals the desires of all people to all people.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  This is the final rebuttal of the Panarchy to the claim that they're all lying infiltrators.  Since everyone knows what everyone else wants, the Panarchy is fully exposed... and somehow, Panarchists do *better* under this rule.  How?  How do the lying infiltrator-tyrants who want their wills to overwrite the wills of others do better when nobody can lie!?  Well...  Great gobbing swabs of them are not lying, were not lying, do not want to BE lying, and do not want to overwrite the will of anyone.  They simply have a very low propensity to hatred.  Lacking hatred, such Panarchists *do* see beauty in maintaining countless simultaneous social systems and near-perpetual sociological experiments.
	5.  Authorial protest:  I would put this past the Dream Reeves technology (+Happiness) rather than past Subconscious Education (+Science), which I think is a specific corruption of the Panarchic ideal.  The society-crushing implications of this tech would be reduced by building Dream Reeves first, too...
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  More broadly, the artificial dreamtime connects people in a telepathic web.  People know what each other want, because they can start to share their feelings very directly.  Imagine the CEL Cradles from Beyond Earth, and then imagine the technology metastasizing until it starts becoming ubiquitous in daily life.  If this could be done very smoothly, it could be very good... but I'm not sure how smoothly I should imagine the technology's implementation to be.  The Viceroy doesn't seem to present the nicest conceivable setting, so implementing this very smoothly notably lacks the potential vengeance factor of suddenly turning the lights on when everyone in the room is lying *except* the Panarchists.
	7.  Downside analysis:  A lot of the thoughts that people would rather not broadcast get broadcast.  It's not hard to imagine society collapsing due to accidental thoughts.  I once briefly had an unwanted mental image of violently raping someone while walking past them.  Would I have done that?  No.  Would anything true have been revealed by exposing the thought?  Also no.  Likewise, I've had a lot of random thoughts of hitting people I like.  Have I ever acted on them?  No.  Do I want to act on them?  Also no.  Nothing would be gained by broadcasting that thought.
	8.  Narrative indicator:  The only way to adapt to the artificial dreamtime is to not rely on lies at all.  No invasions can be concealed after this.  The fact that the Panarchy has this up its sleeve likely drives a lot of resistance to the Panarchic Informalists, and some of the desperate insistence that the Panarchists are infiltrators may be hopeful longing given that only the Panarchy has a technology to destroy all infiltration... at the little tiny cost of nuking societies that depend on the ability to conceal things from each other.
	9.  Narrative indicator:  The happier society is, the better this technology is from a utopia standpoint.  This overrides the usual evaluation based on bureaucratic waste progression.  This society shares misery and happiness alike more equally.
	10.  Downside analysis:  This could lead to people hiding from each other on the basis of quirks in their thinking that would be harmless without it, thereby eroding social organization in the territory.  For example, it could lead to damaging new intolerances based on people who have *unpleasant minds* for reasons out of their own control (in a community that couldn't forgive random never-followed impulses, f'rex).
	11.  Downside analysis:  This would sharply reduce the rate at which evil people can embed malevolent intentions in culture without getting caught.  While that should improve culture on average, some of the people who "get away with" being nasty in culture have really done no harm.
	12.  Categorization:  A side effect of this technology is that it makes avoiding unpleasantness by shoving tasks off onto other people no longer work, which necessitates broad hedonological development for society's continued functioning... making this the only hedonological nightmare technology.
	13.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Mostly non-literal.  The implementation of this technology is largely driven by consumer goods, yet this technology's implementation substantially impairs society's ability to complete bureaucratic tasks.  If society hasn't resolved all misery and doesn't swiftly collapse, people might wish it had...

32.  Mental Unity
	1.  Authorial protest:  This should be 'Sapience Axioms', a technology with the same mechanical effect as Mental Unity.  The proper description of Sapience Axioms is something like this: "There are commonalities that arise in all forms of sapient cognition.  When society has begun to catalog and understand these, sense can often be made of even the strangest communications."
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  My protest is only about theming.  I think the mechanical basis of the mental unity technology is the understanding of how minds are like each other.  Manipulativeness is encapsulated in this understanding, but also compassion.  The hyperspace linkage is... just the probabilistic similarities between people.  One of the themes of the Old Empire (as I interpret them) is that they describe things in strange ways, but still back their technology with considerable mathematical acuity.  'Mental Unity' offers a key to their language... if you understand it.  'Sapience Axioms' would convey the concept even better.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  Mental Unity - or Sapience Axioms - encourages the development of esoteric culture.  From the search for beauty in industry, to very expensive allocations that ultimately only serve people's sense of beauty, to the willful creation of bizarre artifacts...  The basic idea of this tech is that people should be free to explore the bizarre, because their peers should have faith that there is still a likeness between the bizarre and the familiar.
	4.  Downside analysis:  The conviction that people react predictably can be misused by those who would control society as though reprogramming it.  This technology invokes that, too.
	5.  Downside analysis:  The gibberish rate rises in culture.  Impenetrably "refined" interpretations proliferate as people try to explore the limits of communication.  This happens under 'Sapience Axioms', too.
	6.  Downside analysis:  I went through hell as a niche artistic performer with an audience who were dead sure I wanted to be doing what I was doing... and nobody could rescue me until that social environment fell apart completely.  This happened because people were sure that they understood what other minds were like, and they interpreted everything about me through that lens, including my complaints.  This is one of the things that can go wrong with Mental Unity.
	7.  Downside analysis:  If what people think is universal is reproductive desire, the utopianism of this technology falls farther.  This is another thing that I am judging from my own experiences, for which I am giving this -1 utopianism where natalist policies are active.
	8.  Tech level analysis:  Like the Seat of Beauty and Holistic Industrialization, this technology is perfectly smooth... because it doesn't really say anything about the actual technology level of the society implementing it.  You could implement this at any tech level.  People just have to be willing to believe in it.  From there, it may (if successful) promote technological advancement through convincing people to trust in and experiment with weird ideas.
	9.  Mechanism proposal:  Regrettably, as I've written the Imperials to have a hive-mind, this technology also suggests that the hive-mind is being reconstructed after the implied transhuman rights advances of Distributed Intelligence.  Still... this requires that the work be done *aesthetically*, with better respect for individual creative potential.  Better to be in a Unity hivemind than a splintered shard.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Literal!  It's totally literal bureaucratic waste.  It establishes segments of government that are doing things only because they're beautiful.  And, well...  Okay, some of it's not literal, but it's not promoting hatred.  This is almost certainly not going to kill talented people or make them unwilling to cooperate with others.  It'll just... encourage them to feel safe performing very esoteric arts for very niche audiences.  Sometimes that's amazing.  Sometimes that's a waste of talent.

33.  Engineered Optimism
	1.  Authorial protest:  This technology is horrifying.  It proposes a deliberate manipulation of *plague and disease* to make people happier.  Come on, don't make people sneeze for all eternity.  I say this as someone who finds sneezes amusing and reassuring, even!
	2.  Authorial protest:  I would replace this technology with Horizontal Eugenics.  The name sounds like a dirty joke ("let's get horizontal"), but that's not how I mean it.  The description would be something like this: "In a truly advanced society, there is no need for maladaptive and immiserating traits, but compassionate geneticists can spread every advantage to every person to whom it is relevant, so that everyone can be happy in their jobs."  This would be an excellent Imperial technology; it promotes hard-working happiness and protects the people who believe that their happiness should be without toil.  People who love their jobs do not work a day in their lives!  That potential lies within the Orbital Observers tech tree, and it is wasted with the disease-based manipulation of Engineered Optimism.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  This tech is kind of grim.  It sounds like... public healthcare failures repainted into successes, as the survivors of plagues are the people who believed that they (or their lineages) would survive plagues.  The DNA of such failed geneticists would be riddled with introns and inclusions from the viruses that ran rampant in their society, but they would be more optimistic on average.  Yay?
	4.  Narrative indicator:  Plague.  Filth.  A society rotting apart in the control of sociopathic geneticists.  This is the kind of thing that would take over society if we let old school bigots have all their eugenics projects forever.  Their anti-compassionate misunderstandings of genetics would fail them forever.  No, no, no!
	5.  Authorial protest:  I'm just gonna say it again, this slot really needs to belong to "Horizontal Eugenics".  Sure, the statwise effect is just a planetary +Happiness either way, but we can do better than... designing programs of failure that select for happiness over long periods of time.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  This society is probably also riddled with gene plagues as contagious "updates" to their genomes spread.  Actually, that might be true of the "Horizontal Eugenics" society, too...
	7.  Apologia:  There could be theoretical utility from contagious DNA updating.  Orbital hospitals and urban planning would make this suck less - as those strengthen, the public health authorities get more competent and have more ability to do sane things with this bad idea... or the idea that I'd replace it with.
	8.  Categorization:  This is the *only* failsafe nightmare technology.  It's already... basically about a form of failure in motion.  Horizontal Eugenics wouldn't be a Nightmare technology.
	9.  Narrative indicator:  Implemented as Horizontal Eugenics, this is really the technology that eliminates sociopathy, which in my previous thoughts I'd considered as the technology of Extirpation of Sociopaths.  Horizontal Eugenics is a broadening of that concept, but it still gets at the genetic underpinnings of sadism and starts gently sweeping it out of society as a disadvantageous trait.  People who would abuse others are merely expressing the misery of a disadvantageous genetic basis.  They should be spared from their suffering by medical intervention... which just happens to also spare other people from suffering under their control.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste proposal:  Zero literalism.  This is (as described in the base game) a dystopian technology that reduces bureaucratic talent by killing bureaucrats.  Horizontal eugenics would be a much more literal bureaucratic waste, with non-literal components arising only from hedonic pursuit of irrelevant specialties... but Engineered Optimism?  Oh yeah, it just kills off people who the state needs.

34.  Panarchic Cathedral
	1.  Authorial appeal:  I'm biased.  This reminds me of being Kairn, the secretly secular dragon priest of the wind.  I lived in a cathedral and sang for the people, trying to prove that dragons could be harmless pacifists.  That was like...  three centuries.  It was good, but frustrating.  I lived a boring life and I made gains so slowly.  I thought, if only I could live forever, I could surely win...  I took a grevious soul-deep risk to try to gain what I needed, and for that I was killed by a mind-controlling inquisitor who puppeteered others to lynch me.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  I see no reason for this to be anything but what it claims to be.  It's a religious institution that advocates tolerance between people of all faiths or lacks thereof.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  This employs and develops some of the most serene people in the Panarchy.  If Imperial influences vanish in a Panarchic-held territory that has panarchic cathedrals, surely some of them became Panarchic priests.  This was the technology that inspired me to start adding conversion potentials to the analysis, because it has Panarchy<->Empire conversion potential.  It can help Panarchists understand Imperial Serenity, and it can help Imperials understand Panarchic Will.
	4.  Downside analysis:  This equivocation between faiths isn't really how most religious people think, is it?  I really wish I could treat this as Failsafe, but opening the door of political authority to religious disputes suggests that it actually fails in religious conflict.  Religious conflict falls while the Cathedrals stand, but rises when they fall.
	5.  Progression analysis:  It's very "social technology" and doesn't obviously impact genetics, but I think this would improve the protection of asexual genes in society.  It provides for an asexual purpose for religion, which is otherwise presented in the game as being a wholly sexual thing...  I think culture is a more sacred mystery than population growth.  I personally would feel more protected in a society (religious or not) where these cathedrals rise... and if that society was religious, the population growth that religion promotes would be more likely to include me.  If I extend that self-estimate to guess about a possible demographic effect on asexuals in general, I think it suggests a preservative effect on the demographic.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  I think confession of sins is a function that benefits society and which I wish that secular society preserved in some way.  I wasn't even raised Catholic...  I just think it's a good idea.  It's something I've pursued in my own life.  Not hiding sins is a way to prevent one's will from splintering with compartmentalization.  I think the Panarchic Cathedrals could serve this function.
	7.  Author appeal:  I'm not sure why, but I really enjoy imagining Imperial priests.  More than Panarchic or Commonwealth priests, for sure.  Maybe it's because I see the cultural quality of a priesthood as being predominantly determined by their capability of attaining serenity, rather than by their willpower or unity with the rest of society.  I imagine the Imperials getting more robotic with every advance in Wealth... and it just doesn't stop me from seeing them as like unto Kairn, and the very best priests.
	8.  Bureaucratic waste proposal:  People competing to be priests...  It's not a conventionally productive endeavor, is it?  Resources directed towards constructing and maintaining cathedrals aren't doing anything for the conventional economy.  The excuse of respecting all faiths could become a potential way to cheat the public purse as well, if people conspired to lie and gain "holy" sinecures.  The Cathedrals ostensibly oppose religious hatred, but that itself could spin up religious hatreds pretty fast, too.  They risk looking like a tyrannical imposition from galactic powers with no understanding of how the people in the society they're governing are actually thinking.

35.  Panarchic Indoctrination
	1.  Challenge cured:  Rebel Faction
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  There are rebel factions in literally every province.  Panarchic Indoctrination teaches them to be subtle and charismatic like the rebels in every other province.  It doesn't cure anything at all, but it sure makes the territory look cured!  Don't you feel so much safer now that the murderous rebels appear to be perfectly normal people?
	3.  Authorial protest:  It seems stressful, doesn't it?  I'm starting to settle into the idea that maybe I should improve the entire tech tree, but I'm not sure how to improve on this.  I'm... making a note here mostly to establish the pattern of starting off with a protest of each one.  My protest here is that this seems very stressful and high-pressure.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Heavy public funding for artistic education.  Colleges of the arts.  A society of parents who press their kids to make artistic masterpieces...  This is one of the most nakedly authoritarian pieces of Panarchic policy, as alluded to by its use of the word 'Indoctrination'.  While it leads to a more tolerantly diverse society, it does so through stressful methods.
	5.  Authorial protest:  Implementing this would tend to cast me personally out of the Panarchy as a failed artist.  I have very little artistic skill; I can just barely manage my own style and I have no ability to copy widely diverse styles.
	6.  Downside analysis:  This is one of the pieces of policy structure which gets the Panarchy labeled as infiltrators.  These people are more capable of producing fakes and knock-offs, and they're more capable of making themselves useful to arbitrary organizations with arbitrary rhetoric.
	7.  Downside analysis:  Like everything that suggests bad childrearing, there's a risk of decreasing the quality of society in a pretty broad way.  Coating everything with a layer of advanced aesthetics only papers over the problem.
	8.  Downside analysis:  The larger the planet that implements panarchic indoctrination, the more totally replaceable and interchangeable artists are.  It has a similar problem to the cultural improvements of the Commonwealth Unifiers, in making art interchangeable and commodified.
	9.  Apologia:  I do think this would at least tend to magnify marginal subcultures rather than suppress them.
	10.  Apologia:  As a planet-wide commitment, this would also tend to surface artistic talents from underprivileged backgrounds.  Some of the people who would otherwise be criminals and/or stuck in generational poverty will instead become respected artists.
	11.  Apologia:  Like the Commonwealth cultural improvements that I think would tend to make the art world miserable, I think this would tend to 'fail safe' by falling apart in recriminations among pacifists rather than ending more explosively.
	12.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This directly expands the educational bureaucracy.  It also locks art in the rough, talony grip of the Panarchy.  Some of the people who fail under this pressure will be very bitter and unproductive.

36.  Colonial Office:
	1.  Authorial protest:  TBD.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  These encourage bidirectional migration.  They do not encourage net migration unless they cause an increase in wealth levels.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  One of the things that happens in every subculture while one plays the game is that the lower classes vanish while the upper classes develop.  The colonial offices make that process seem more likely to be peaceful, because they suggest that people leave peacefully.
	4.  Downside analysis:  Standard anti-multiculturalism arguments that everything gets watered down, blah blah blah, I don't believe in this criticism.  It may also encourage misappropriation and distortion of cultural ideas as they are trafficked across vast differences and applied to the lives and artistic careers of people far from where they started.  I see these kinds of complaint as very similar to each other...
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  By discouraging hatred and encouraging self-selected residence (bidirectional migration!), some of the Colonial Office's cultural gains are the result of the lack of hatred breaking up the unity of the local culture.  I like this a lot better than Panarchic Indoctrination for its likely implications on cultural stress.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  I first imagined that these were literally negotiating 1-to-1 swaps between people who lived in entirely different star systems, offering people who might otherwise not have the wealth or prominence the opportunity to travel very long distances and live somewhere new.
	7.  Apologia:  This is an omni-converter.  Perhaps anything can be unfriendly, as it should be noted that this technically works by getting dissidents to *leave*... but the important thing is that it means population demographics shift more peacefully in every direction.
	8.  IRL Politics note:  It's important to divorce the concept of colonialism in The Viceroy from the IRL concept of colonialism, as I'm like 95% sure that the IRL implications of colonialism aren't being invoked here. 
	9.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Literal, albeit occasionally corrupt.  All these cultural ambassador positions are very non-work roles that only contribute to the colonial office's ambitions on average.

37.  Hydroponic Farms
	1.  Challenge cured:  Photosynthetic Plague
		1.  Challenge cure interpretation:  Closed environment farming permits crops to be grown despite the plague and brings in the appropriate research talent to research curing it.
	2.  Authorial protest:  This should be moved to where Zero Gravity Farms is.  I'm not sure what should be put here, but I'll keep thinking about it.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  Wow, literalism.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  There's no reason to assume this technology is anything but what it says on the tin.  It's so straightforward!
	5.  Downside analysis:  This is so much less impressive than the other technologies in the game - I'm not saying it wouldn't work like it says! - that it comes off as boring and unmarvelous.
	6.  Trivia:  The icon for this technology is a dome in space with fields and trees inside of it, suggesting that this is a distrct-by-district version of the massive structures used for Zero Gravity Farms.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  This technology likely extends into vertifarming and urban agriculture in general, which some people (such as me!) do consider futuristic and awesome.
	8.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Literal, although I guess it could inspire intransigence for sheer boringness.  There could also be concern that the galaxy has tons of biological production already.  Not sure though.  Actually, I think it's kind of unfair that this is considered a bureaucratic technology, since I think it would tend to pay off in simple productivity.  It's really straightforward and not cripplingly expensive technology.

38.  Distributed Desalination
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Also literal.
	2.  Downside analysis:  These systems really are marginal in productivity.  They could work wonders... if tended for centuries...  We could green deserts with this tech!  Eventually...  The description says, "the ability to produce fresh water in nearly limitless quantities,"  but that's not a reasonable expectation.  Like with the Beyonder Engines, I suspect that this technology requires playing a trick with temporality to understand: *with sufficient patience*, you can get infinite water out of distributed desal.  Meanwhile, it's expensive.
	3.  Trivia:  A nasty joke once occurred to me based on this tech.  I'm honestly trying to remember it right now, but I'm not succeeding.  Something about desalinating tears?  I don't think it should factor into how we would expect this to be implemented.
	4.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Almost literal.  It's even more dull than hydroponic farms.  Like some of the really good Imperial technologies, implementing this tries the patience of people.  It is likely to lead to anti-government sentiment.

39.  Seasteading
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  This is part of a great little triad of literalism in the Orbital Observers tech tree.  Unlike a lot of the literal technologies, this doesn't suggest homogenization at all.  (I may have to redefine the homogenization schtick I wrote about the Empire before.)  This suggests a bit of a local ideological countermeasure to the dullness of the Hydroponic Farms and Distributed Desal linkage... and it suggests a kind of community that could *really* use those distributed desal plants, too.
	2.  Trivia:  This is something people have proposed IRL.  We *have* hydroponic farms in the real world, and people are working on distributed desal techs, too.  The reason why seasteading hasn't taken off is that it is "too expensive".  In this game, it's presented as a planet-wide development project, so maybe humanity will get there when we manage to unify our planetary government.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  By encouraging literal wide separations between communities, more diverse and fractious people can live in society without friction or hatred.  The description of the tech in-game references this potential, although I think it also has some general (and beautiful) applicability to the anti-crowding technologies.
	4.  Categorization:  I'm making a note here, I may want to include an "overlocalist" category.  This would be one of the potential overlocalist technologies.  Sure, it's a planet-wide tech... but it speckles the oceans with communities that are defined by disagreeing with each other.
	5.  Conversion potential:  By protecting dissidents from misrule (including by each other), this is a potent connection between Imperial and Panarchic ideology.  For protecting dissidents from unification and unifiers from dissidents, it's also a weak connection between Imperial and Commonwealth ideology.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Very literal.  Unless those border communities turn feral, but that's as likely as modern cities breaking away from their nations IMO.  Good for stories, not likely to really happen.

40.  Seat of Justice
	1.  Authorial protest:  I think humanity built one of these on Earth - so to speak - in the dawn of civilization.  While I don't contest its mechanical effects, and I'm about to rate it a solid 5/5 utopianist, I also don't think that it comprises... the entirety of utopia.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  The concern for justice is both primordial and valid.  It's also been subject to ongoing change throughout history.  The Seat of Justice equips society to change and experiment over time in ways that make it more just.  This always leads to a good society, but it might take a long time.
	3.  Note on Synergy:  I think this has a special synergy with the Panarchic Symposium.  The symposia give voice to people who might otherwise be voiceless, and would help develop a long-term concept of justice which actually *is* just.
	4.  Trivia:  Some of the ancient Greeks thought that justice meant being fair to one's friends and punishing to one's enemies.  They just... thought that was very accurate.  It took a long time for humanity to go from "trying to achieve justice" to "understanding the importance of fairness", and I wouldn't say we've reached the pinnacle of justice yet.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  I don't think people *can* reach the pinnacle of justice.  People will always be arguing, and in this case the argument is virtuous.  The last iota of justice is worth reaching for.
	6.  Categorization:  Like a lot of the Commonwealth Unifier technologies, the Seats of Justice suggest nothing at all about the technological development of the societies that build them, and is therefore hypersmooth.  Unlike other hypersmooth technologies, they also don't contribute to technological development in themselves.  I suspect the Seats of Justice actually pin back dubious advances while checking to make sure that they're being used in the defense of the public weal... and to be very clear, though I categorize that as luddistic, I support it.
	7.  Categorization:  I want to classify these as hedonological, as I truly believe that hedonological structuring is the most just way of organizing society... but I'm not sure, and there are other categorizations that I'm more sure this serves.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Viewed as a true galactic technology, the Seats of Justice are probably a truly essential piece of infrastructural investment.  This modernizes the courts... and very likely not just the courts, but the whole government.
	9.  Author appeal:  I see this as the most integral technology in the game's entire tech tree, which every faction ought to implement in every system.  Good courts are a universal need and the edge-cases in justice are a difficult, stubborn challenge that every civilization should take up!
	10.  Conversion:  Since each ideology presumably has very, VERY well-developed arguments about why they are The Most Justful Righteous Ideology Ever, the Seats of Justice are a weak omniconverter for surfacing the most virtuous of these arguments and their most virtuous proponents.  It would encourage the public to go along with whatever shifts are occurring (and it would help make those shifts actually a good thing, too).  Since many people would surely not listen, it's only a weak omniconverter... but for the record, omniconverters are also virtuous IMO.  It IS better to try to change people's minds through appeals to justice and influence on education than, say, force.
	11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Super-literal.  I'd say this even makes the wastage from other technologies *more literal*, because it pushes society off of bad things that waste talent in bad ways.

41.  Local Government
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Does galactic politics really need to interact with every detail of a local government?  No.  Not even faintly.
	2.  Downside analysis:  I tend to imagine that local government structures draw something of a veil over the exact details of how stuff is being implemented.  The way galactic society would achieve something is a little less important.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  Functioning local governments are also likely to become targets for partisan control.  Is this a problem?  Not really.  It encourages local politics to develop a distinct character and an inclination to *peaceful* disputation that does *not* involve galactic politics.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  The partisan squabbling implied in local governance may contribute to the efficiency of it, in fact.  It takes some of the squabbling that the Viceroy would have to deal with, and efficiently makes people handle it themselves.
	5.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This is a bureaucratic efficiency tech.

42.  Deep Core Tap
	1.  Mechanism proposal:  Mining.  Lots and lots of mining.  I doubt the core is literally being tapped the moment this goes into place, but it wouldn't shock me if it was literally tapped eventually.
	2.  Downside analysis:  Geological destabilization.  Mining out an area conventionally can already cause sinkholes.  I don't even know how to think about the consequences of tapping into a planet's mantle.
	3.  Downside analysis:  This suggests that civilization is REALLY commiting to using ALL the resources of the planet.  It's such a world-eater technology, where all available material is being converted to serve the purposes of the civilization built on the planet.  Is that sustainable?  ...I think that it could be, but...  I think it might not be, too.
	4.  Downside analysis:  Pollution is likely.  The Empire has good pollution-mitigating technologies, but are they present when they're needed?
	5.  Progression analysis:  This is near space elevators on the tech tree.  I think that makes a lot of sense.  Bulk mining like this isn't really valuable to a space-age economy until you can ship sheer mass off-world.
	6.  Narrative indicator:  The Imperials put a LOT of trust into their technology...  This is a little nearer the trust axis than the virtue axis, with good reason.
	7.  Narrative indicator:  Mass mining like this emphasizes the Imperial commitment to creating a LOT of living space.  They build bigger habitats in a greater variety of places than any other faction.  I love that!
	8.  Synergy note:  The game's current mechanics can't represent this, but this technology has massive conceptual synergy with upkeep-reducer technologies (Panarchic Survey, Orbital Surveyors, and Potentialities Overseer).  These watcher organizations are the ones likely to prevent cave-ins.  Cave-ins are massively expensive, too; they don't have to be virtuously motivated to do it!  Each of these structures increases the likelihood of the necessary sensors being in place and functional when they're needed, with social structures influential enough to save lives.
	9.  Conversion:  Since the technologies that make this safe are Panarchic, I think it would make benevolently-motivated Commonwealth citizens more sympathetic to the Panarchy, acting as a weak converter between the two factions.
	10.  Categorization:  As a highly extremophilic technology that dramatically increases the real estate available to civilization, I think this would increase diversity as well.
	11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Discomfiting to think about.  The proponents of the tech are likely to be very peaceful, well-intended people with a tremendous dedication to their engineering.  Despite that, I don't think this is a failsafe technology...  Every so often, an entire city might be lost to landmasses caving in.  These extreme conditions make for dangerous work environments, too.  I think that deep core taps make planets bleed talent in deep, dark places where there's no way out.  The only thing keeping this from flattening to 1/5 utopianism is that it takes a while for the hazard to set in.

43.  Orbital Surveyor
	1.  Challenge cured: Invasive Organisms
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  The orbital surveyors look like they have the largest ecologist contingent.  This technology brings in the ecologists who can deal with invasive organizations.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  The literally described mechanism works... more or less.  Like all the -Upkeep techs in the game, it's a total waste of resources unless one of two things is true: 1) you have excessively awesome administrators and no bureaucratic waste, or 2) your administration has basically collapsed from bureaucratic waste and you're just clinging until you get reassigned.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  A network of observation satellites probably gives a pretty good idea of what's going wrong... but it doesn't necessarily give much power to *do* anything about it.  Every time you build these, a few more of your society's leaders are getting high and laughing as systems collapse.  Only literally getting high, of course... probably.
	5.  Apologia:  That really doesn't make things any worse.
	6.  Narrative indicator:  This does uphold high-tech development, and it changes the *kind* of lurking disasters that would be building up.  Stuff that's obviously visible from orbit would be less troubling once you've got these built up.
	7.  Downside analysis:  I don't know why, but I've got the sense that these systems could end up being used by creeps.  Maybe any kind of closed omniscience system would have that problem.  The more the general public has access to the grid, the better, but even were the sensors public access the public wouldn't have access to the institutional analyses.  Maybe I shouldn't worry about this.
	8.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Launch systems, sensor grids, logisticians.  I don't think this wastes anyone in the bad way, but I do think it's expensive to operate.

44.  Orbital Habitats
	1.  Challenge Cured:  Ice Age
	2.  Challenge Cure Interpretation:  I'm not sure.  Controlled global warming due to numerous space launches?  Replacement of groundside farms with orbital farms?  Both?  The Orbital Surveyors (I refer to them by their capstone) do like farming in orbit.
	3.  Alternative cure interpretation:  If the orbital observers settle preferentially in weird and sparsely populated areas, perhaps they can also be directed to sink waste heat pipes into the permafrost so that precipitation increases and atmospheric water vapor retains more heat.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  This is pretty obviously literal.  I'd have to stretch to come up with a non-literal interpretation; it could for instance also refer to a pattern of smaller rural population centers 'orbiting' big population centers groundside.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  Like all the +Crowding techs, this implicitly reduces all-causes mortality.  Better policing, sanitation, medical services.  More peaceful populations.  I want to talk about that one, because I think it's substantial here.  An orbital colony would need to be a compact, highly cooperative society due to the intrinsic hazards of its location.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  Imagine a place where a steadying hand is never far away... and there's nowhere for bullies to gang up on kids they hate.  I consider this tech to be associated with the most top-quality childrearing environments of any tech on the tech tree.  Kids need the gentleness of serenity more than the force of unity, too...  This is the childrearing tech that natalist policies wish they were!
	7.  Downside analysis:  These colonies fail far more horrifyingly than groundside colonies.
	8.  Downside analysis:  Even in the alternative low-tech interpretation (rural population centers 'orbiting' major urban areas), rural communities are often considerably more dysfunctional than urban areas.  The low-tech interpretation is probably not the correct one...  It suggests a 1/5 extremophilia too strongly, as rural areas with ugly bubble cultures infamously resist technology.
	9.  Author appeal:  Seriously, these are great!  Until they're not.   But they're great until then!
	10.  Categorization:  Since orbital habitats fail dangerously, this is a nightmare tech.  Sorry!  Stay on top of bureaucratic waste!
	11.  Apologia:  Come on, real societies never develop into incomprehensible messes that lose literally ALL of their tax money in bureaucratic waste.  Don't worry about it.  It's just a gameism.  Total absolute paralysis only happens in The Viceroy.  Real leaders know: stay on top of bureaucratic waste!
	12.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The low-tech interpretation would be likely to entrench some amount of hatred of bureaucracy and create horrible bubbles of vile rural 'culture'... but I'm going to ignore that.  The high-tech interpretation is pretty pure, though painfully so; you can't exactly let the life support requisitions slip.  Nor any of the other requisitions.  Every neglected orbital habitat is an entire city full of people likely to die horrifically.  The Influence technologies would be essential here; these societies need to stay attached to galactic politics for their safety.

45.  Panarchic Symposium
	1.  Challenge cure interpretation:  Cultural Isolation
		1.  Challenge cure interpretation:  This one bothers me.  Cultural isolation is described as the district's culture being "backwards, provincial, and strange" even to the district's own inhabitants.  I can see how exposing their culture to the galaxy could 'help' fix that, but I think it might be healthier for the self-esteem of the public to build the symposium and *other* cultural boosters rather than to 'cure' this in that way, so that they can develop a distinctive culture with no risk of turning out bland.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  "Symposium" sounds grandiose, but I think that's just Panarchic puffery (I don't hold it against them).  I believe these constructs represent society entrenching its dedication to intelligent discourse and long-term policy study in a district-by-district manner.  It's like the Seat of Policy in miniature, reaching farther down the bureaucracy to address the connection between local politics and galactic politics directly.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  Constructing symposia also reinforces dedication to freedom of speech.  This can be important in societies that have invested in potentially authoritarian structures such as "enlightened policing" and for that matter "adaptive antipsychotics".  The symposia gather the impressions of the public and try to keep galactic society from forgetting dissent.
	4.  Progression analysis:  The symposia advance the cause of open access academia, leading naturally to the Lyceum.  I like this linkage in the graph.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  A certain basic level of public order is necessary for the symposia to function.  Mentioning the dedication to freedom of speech again, people in warzones don't exactly get their rights well-protected; like other influence structures, the Panarchic Symposia therefore suggest some amount of 'groundclearing' to stabilize society and some amount of emergency logistical preparations in case it falls apart again.
	6.  Categorization:  This tech is hypersmooth.  It doesn't establish tech level at all.
	7.  Conversion:  I think the discourse that the symposia surfaces can provide the potential for a limited (education-type) omniconversion effect (suggesting that cultural transitions would be more peaceful).  This function is good, but not necessarily as pure as the newfallen snow; a government sifting through large amounts of discourse can potentially surface the POVs it wants to see win, as long as those POVs exist within the public.
	8.  Downside analysis:  Crosstalk, surfacing of disagreements, political argumentation, unrealistic demands for further investment, accusations that every random government program under the sun is somehow corrupt or incompetent, etc.  The symposia increase all of it.  Panarchists like this stuff.  Commonwealth and Imperials can be drawn into it just as much, but less happily.
	9.  Apologia:  Whatever else may or may not be corrupt in society, I expect the Symposia itself to be a technology representing a well of integrity.  It opens transparency as society grows clouded.
	10.  Apologia:  I think the vast well of information and impressions gathered from the symposia would be essential for long-term policy research.  They help the public debate in a smarter way, they get policy research out of the ivory tower, and (as a minor function) they provide creative fodder for society to make stories out of.
	11.  Progression analysis:  I'm not really clear how this progresses into the Panarchic Cathedral... despite that I personally kind of embody the connection.  I *agree* with the connection, I just don't understand it.  I see myself in both technologies and it reminds me of how one of the decisions that would've shaped my life totally differently was that I decided against seeking to join a seminary school when I was twelve.  If I'd followed Kairn's path in this lifetime, I'd have sought to go from the symposium to the cathedral... sometimes I regret not doing that.
	12.  Author appeal:  Even though this is me-points 2/3, this is one of the most profoundly 'me' technologies on the tech tree.  This was my childhood dream job, and by surfacing people who contribute to art and science, it is still within my own potential should I focus my will enough.  The thing is... it doesn't reduce my opposition to reproduction.  The thing with *that* is... I'M ASEXUAL!
	13.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Like with the Seat of Policy, I see this as a very straightforward pricetag.  The district produces a lot more analytical noise that has to be processed, but doing this work is very 'pure' albeit very literally bureaucratically expensive.

46.  Prenatal Education
	1.  Challenge cured:  Primitive education
		1.  Challenge cure interpretation:  This challenge cure pushes children harder to perform.  They're supposed to hit the ground running, put their nose to the grindstone, and fulfill all their parents' ambitions for their lives, all while hiring fewer educators to do more work.
		2.  Challenge cure qualm:  These schools sound unpleasant for children.  Can we work around this cure instead of implementing it?  How about waiting until we've got a lot of Happiness technologies implemented?
	2.  Author protest:  I think this possibly should be Ancestral Recording.  I wrote below that Ancestral Recording should be where the University is; I'm not sure.  I don't see Prenatal Education as a 'real' technology unless it's a *Panarchic* technology, and the rest of what I write about it will probably explain why.
	3.  Author protest:  Countermanding the above, I think this might be something that would *follow from* Ancestral Recording, shifting the University to the Panarchy and replacing it with Ancestral Recording.  This would position the Commonwealth Consensus as a remarkable lineage society which establishes extreme genetic self-knowledge as its foundation, since they would have Creche Schools leading to Ancestral Recording, which then lead to Prenatal Education.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Does anyone remember those "listen to classical music so your baby will be smarter" ads?  Those were common in the 90s, and as a classical music fan in childhood, they contributed to my sense that reproduction was being treated as the entire purpose of life.  Sex was the authority I had to accept.  This is... the gentlest, most harmless version of Prenatal Education.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  Life-planning.  Arranged marriages.  Children being born for roles, quite literally.  Possibly even caste systems and vertical eugenics (vertical eugenics is eugenics by lineage, ie sterilizing the poor, as contrasted to horizontal eugenics, which is eugenics via gene therapy).  This tech is authoritarian.
	6.  Downside analysis:  People aren't THAT good at predicting their descendant's talents and preferences.  I don't know how much I should need to say here.  The mismatch stories are likely to be awful.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Pressing children super-hard can also achieve this objective.  Like when I got math homework that took all night...  Thaaat's the Commonwealth!  The relative gentility of the Panarchy is why I'm drawn to preferring them.
	8.  Categorization:  History suggests that these regimes tend to come apart without violence as people move on from them, so... it's a failsafe technology.  Sure, *the Nazis* took a world war to dismantle, but there've been a lot of life-planning, marriage-arranging conservative authoritarian societies that just got taken apart by their descendants rebelling peacefully.  It's a nightmare technology because it suggests a dystopia for a lot of trapped children, but it's a failsafe technology because it comes apart with a whimper rather than a boom.
	9.  Conversion:  While I do not think this can convert between Panarchy and Commonwealth populations (it suggests aggravated frictions instead), I think that the Imperial focus on specialization suggests that this technology empowers the educational system to promote fluctuation between Commonwealth and Imperial populations.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Very NOT literal.  There's little bureaucracy involved in implementing this technology, and quite a lot of social strife that it opens up to make getting work done harder.  Higher trauma burdens in subsequent generations cost a lot of productivity.

47.  University System
	1.  Challenge cured:  Segregated Education
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  Looking at the history of Earth, it looks like universities pressed education to desegregate by getting people enthusiastic about ideas and wanting to share them with people across the arbitrary boundaries that people try to draw.  The universities also provide the talent to quantify the costs of segregation and challenge it on the merits.  This is all very ethical, but somewhat expensive.
	3.  Challenge cure protest:  This is petty and personal, and I'm not sure it should stop anything from going forward, but one of the categories of segregation that the tech is described as opposing is segregation by intelligence.  See, I was treated really badly in a public school *with no gifted program*.  I think I personally would've been safer if there'd been a gifted program.  This makes me a little reluctant to desegregate education.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  WYSIWYG.
	5.  Narrative indicator:  We already have a functioning system of universities on Earth.  It works like this.
	6.  Author protest:  I think the Panarchy would love universities just as much as the Commonwealth if not more, and I think there's a minor ideological tension over them as both faction populations want universities on all their planets.
	7.  Apologia:  Maybe it's not a tension, but perhaps this search for new ideas is something that the two factions share happily.
	8.  Author appeal:  I wrote Marchosias' concept of the afterlife as including a 'university loop' as its second stage.  It was eternal for people who wanted to experience it eternally, but otherwise it was a transitional environment towards experiencing different segments of the afterlife she created.  It was also a bureaucratic layer for organizing impressions of the cosmos.
	9.  Categorization:  I think universities draw people towards their heart's desire, helping people build specialist skills that they really want to have.  The enhanced technical skill that a university system enables also means that more of the jobs nobody wants are automated away.  These factors promote hedonological organization in society and mean that more people have jobs because they *want* those jobs.
	10.  Categorization:  Although universities do not imply any particular level of technology (I believe Earth was still very much in the feudal era when our first universities were built), I think they promote technological disruption too much to be hypersmooth.  They also promote an interface between local and galactic politics.
	11.  Conversion:  I expect that the universities promote flux between Commonwealth and Panarchic populations quite fluidly.  To a lesser extent, they also promote fluctuations between other populations and the Empire, as people also pursue advanced specializations in universities.  Like other educational technologies, they're a good albeit imperfect omniconverter.

48.  Mental Transcription
	1.  Authorial protest:  This is one of the most dangerously authoritarian technologies in the tree... and yet it's also one that I see as profoundly beautiful.  I want to live in a society that does this in a manner respectful of freedom... and I never want to live in a society that does this in a manner disrespectful of freedom.  How does one create a society that can use this power in a way that liberates people?  *I don't know.*
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  If you have enough nanotech and neuroscience, I think this can be done straightforwardly.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  Rolling out mental transcription really develops the Panarchic Cybertechnologies market in a district.  Implants (and especially skillsofts) become more common and more awesome.
	4.  Note on synergy:  I think that this technology is more beautiful in areas that also have creche education systems.  Children would move more swiftly through their lessons and be less overburdened by homework assignments.
	5.  Note on synergy:  I think implementing this hires a lot of the same people as a Distributed Intelligence system, and the two technologies should work together quite efficiently.
	6.  Categorization:  This is very much a technology in the Mind Control trio.  It's considerably more horrifying than the milder and less controlling implications of telepathic dust.
	7.  Conversion:  This... IS an omniconverter.  A very horribly powerful one.  It gives the state the power to overwrite minds in real-time, and the requirements of being an educational database only reduce that a little bit.  It may increase population stereotypy as it increases conformance to the three 'galactic archetypes'; if so, this effect will be weakest on Panarchists themselves, as their focus on developing diverse wills, cultural diversity, and multigovernance suggests that there isn't really a single Panarchic stereotype for Panarchists to conform to.
	8.  Note on Me-points:  I can't tell if I should rate this a -1 or a 3.
	9.  Categorization:  This is also an extremely awesome rehabilitative technology.  The Panarchy's adult education system must be epic in its productivity, as a system like this would make retraining adults into something fluid and fun.
	10.  Categorization:  As this encourages more of the computational substrate of the district to be used to understand people, and more of the mindpower of the system to be moved to computational substrate, it's an empathy maximizer advance.  Yet this is a scary one, that could be used all too readily to hurt people.
	11.  Downside analysis:  There's a lot of rote to the implied scientific advance of mental transcription, like with the Panarchic Lyceum.  This is one of the reasons why I proposed rotating the Lyceum into the Informalist tech tree.  The Lyceum's description directly invokes rote instruction.  The Mental Transcription databases are an instant super-rote.  It'd be hard to challenge falsehoods in them.
	12.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Half-literal.  Like with Distributed Intelligence, this society would have to hire a lot more fact-checkers, social scientists, and neuroscientists.  Yet the social stresses that this technology imposes would create a lot of intransigence and outright violence.  A smart state would tolerate a lot of protest activities as proof that they're *not* overwriting minds, especially if it's true, but potentially even if it's not.  There's likely also be "bureaucratic waste" resulting from entrenchment of errors in the databases, as the mental transcription databases would be hard to challenge.

49.  Leisure Subsidies
	1.  Challenge cured:  Double Star System
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  The two stars are described as overheating the system.  I guess that makes it... tropical?  Balmy?  Are the leisure subsidies used to justify a rollout of tourism subsidies that draw in an increased population of people who love lounging around in warm places?  I can fathom it, because as a dragon I can imagine the love of heat rocks, but for some reason this "challenge cure" irks me.  Maybe it's because the Commonwealth is usually so good at literalism, but suddenly this one is opaque and requires lateral thinking to justify.  Maybe I'm just being unfair.  I'll keep thinking about it.  People don't always get the right answer immediately, and maybe I haven't got the right answer this time.
	3.  Authorial protest:  I don't like parties.  Parties as a kid stressed me to tears, and occasionally to throwing up.  The scarcity of parties in adulthood spares me misery.
	4.  Authorial protest:  My mom's focus on leisure as a means of happiness gave me the sense of having to entertain her from a young age.  I felt dragged around and exhausted.  Her attempts to extract gratitude from me for this backfired, as she was generally not at all capable of understanding what I would actually enjoy.  She thought I was only interested in spending time with her if she was doing something fun, and the point where I cut ties with her was after she complained to me about how I treated her as "the fun mom"...  No, mom.  You weren't fun.
	5.  Mechanism proposal:  I have two interpretations on this tech.  They're pretty much Love vs Hate.  Going by my dreams, the Love interpretation is how the Commonwealth intends it, whereas the Hate interpretation is how the sociopathic failed uplift society (Panarchists) use it.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  The Love interpretation is WYSIWYG.  The leisure subsidies alleviate misery by encouraging people to do fun stuff.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  The Hate interpretation is based on deceptive authoritarianism and psychological abuse.  It uses leisure subsidies to prove that unhappy people deserve to be killed by aging, thereby making society "more efficient in the long-run" for the miserable and abusively dishonest tyrants who stomp on the true potential of the will.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Note that occupying people with entertainments has an anti-crime function.  This works better in the Love interpretation than the Hate interpretation, because the maintainers of the Hate system are actually trying to victimize and abuse the people who use entertainments, and that's never quite as traceless as its perpetrators imagine it to be.
	9.  Downside analysis:  The Hate version of this technology is likely to create a persistent problem with murder in society.  Like with how hated ghetto populations on Earth are hated and persistently murderous.  The cultural leaders who try to occupy them dislike them in secret, and their culture therefore 'mysteriously' doesn't improve.
	10.  Progression analysis:  This improves society's retention of boredom-prone people.  That makes it extremophilic.  However, it doesn't say anything of specific technological development, so it's hypersmooth.
	11.  Author appeal:  Even though it's not good for me personally, I think this reflects a rightful focus of government on hedonological organization... in the Love interpretation.  The Love interpretation of Leisure Subsidies is the most harmless technology on the tech tree; it's really trivial to imagine how it causes 'bureaucratic waste' and it does so by purest anti-authoritarianism.
	12.  Authorial protest:  In the Hate interpretation, it provides a potential reason why The Viceroy's setting is constantly being torn down by bureaucratic waste.  Such a desperation to misuse, manipulate, and discard people is extremely wasteful and leads to massive intransigence.
	13.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  The Love interpretation only wastes bureaucrats in the literal way, by adding another layer of bureaucracy.  The Hate interpretation promotes intransigence to government and rational rebellion against sociopathic leaders, wasting bureaucrats in the metaphorical way.

50.  Sentient Capital
	1.  Authorial protest:  As written, this "technology" is gibberish.  You can't make individual units of money sentient.  The closest you can do is slave-trading.  If your currency is slaves, you have sentient capital.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Therefore...  This replaces a meaningful fraction of the planet's currency with AI bankers whose services are traded as a form of fungible currency.  Virtual slave bankers.
	3.  Categorization:  Since this broadens the kind of minds in society and increases the use of virtual environments as a place where people really live, it's diversifying.  I can't evaluate its other categories.
	4.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  I can't tell if this would be literally bureaucratically expensive or metaphorically bureaucratically expensive.  It strikes me as loony.

51.  Pervasive Digitization
	1.  Challenge cured: Violent culture
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  The pervasively digitized society offers a lot of alternative competitions to traditional violence, including analogues which don't kill either party, and it makes it more feasible for people to just *avoid* people who would otherwise try to spark dangerous honor disputes with them.
	3.  Author appeal:  This is one of the more straightforwardly loving techs in the Panarchy tree as-is.  It increases their ability to live with large societies and it suggests investment in Yggdrasil-like projects (what I call 'seeds of Yggdrasil').
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  This is where the virtual world projects really start.  The Panarchy loves simulations.  Simulated governments, simulated societies.  When they talk about digital presence being better than real presence, they mean because of the vast variety of environments that digital presence can provide.
	5.  Downside analysis:  As these are implemented, more of society becomes... detached from reality.  More of what goes on has no bearing with anything 'real'.  This probably encourages some of the more abstract-yet-pacifistic forms of 'bureaucratic waste'.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  This also increases the ability of society to 'metricize' everything, by which I do not mean implementing the metric system, but rather implementing ubiquitous data collection.  This improves society in many ways.
	7.  Downside analysis:  Increasing the ability of society to 'metricize' everything empowers both good and evil.  It's not really liberating.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Some people in societies with pervasive digitization... are actually panarchic AIs.  They're individual AIs that don't have awesome authority, but are just citizens who live in (profoundly space-efficient) housings.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Unreality seeps in despite scientific advancement.  Less of reality becomes such as ordinary people can touch, feel, and verify.
	10.  Mechanism proposal:  This is another of the galaxy's epidemiological technologies.  It increases the ability of people in society to break pathogen transmission chains.  I see real-world digitization as considerably more 
	11.  Progression analysis:  This considerably increases the implied hedonological yield of +Science technologies.  I believe a LOT of development could be sunk into perfecting virtual environments.  If you imagine the histories of the regions extending beyond the Viceregal period, the digitized societies have bright futures... if you don't mind that they have eventually have entire cities full of people who have never been flesh-and-blood.
	12.  Progression analysis:  The smoothness of this technology is actually quite high.  It's not hyper-smooth and it can't exist at notably low technologies (suggesting a measure of implicit anti-primitivism), but societies often start implementing telecommunications *as they can*, developing an increasing reliance on long-distance interactions that takes a long time to refine.
	13.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Predominantly non-literal.  Games proliferate, gamified versions of normal functions proliferate, and real processes start being transformed into 'efficient' virtual processes whose physical existence has been marginalized.

52.  Predictive Supply Chain
	1.  Authorial Protest:  I have mixed feelings about this one.  It emphasizes the frightening over-metricization of the Panarchic Informalists, which is also the frightening over-metricization of the Panarchy (see Panarchic Data Posts).  It's on the omniscience track that leads towards Potentiality Forecasters.  I think it may be mislocated, but it also leads to self-aware economies...  I may take Sentient Capital out of the ideology, and we'll see if that reorg inspires me to shift Predictive Supply Chain's location.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  Calculate *everything*.  Accept no less than perfect logistics!
	3.  Trivia:  Treating just-in-time supply chains as the hallmark of civilization suggests the base tech level of the game.  IRL societies have just-in-time supply chains.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  By observing the flows of resources across society from a huge number of observation points, probable fluctuations can be predicted well in advance, making it possible to supply resources on an as-needed basis without investing in surplus supply.
	5.  Downside analysis:  Just-in-time supply chains already have shown signs of hollowing out IRL logistical capabilities.  When the supply chain is pulled taut for efficiency, it also becomes brittle.  Predictive supply chains will only be able to increase the availability of resources *on average*, as even with excellent predictions there's still a gambling factor.  With reservoirs minimized, critical resources will occasionally be completely impossible to source.
	6.  Downside analysis:  Partisan conflicts could be intensified by the use of predictive supply chains, as corrupted overseers could 'accidentally' undersupply opponents within the margin of error without being detected.  This issue would tend to get better over time... from administration to administration.  It would get worse within a given term.  It's an Influence thing; this technology would be better if the Omniscience track peaked with a Collapse Overseer (which would press transparency into the post-mortems) rather than a Potentialities Overseer (which really only intensifies waste).
	7.  Downside analysis:  Industrial exploitation can't be indefinitely sustained.  The game doesn't credit this, but I think it may be one of the hidden factors which contributes to 'bureaucratic waste' as administrations go on, particularly if they pursue Panarchic industrialization.
	8.  Trivia:  I think this is a powerful and probable futuristic technology that humanity is deeply likely to invent if it settles enough locations... with all associated downsides.
	9.  Categorization:  I'm not sure this qualifies for any of the special categories I've defined to-date... and I'm tempted to give it a very unusual category.  'Realistic'.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This technology is 100% proudly non-literal in its contribution to administrative waste.  Its proponents present it as pure efficiency, but I think that this tends to cause accidents as it starts to exceed available administrative capabilities and then to hollow out economies as it severely exceeds administrative capabilities.  Gradually more of the resources just aren't there when they're needed.

53.  Absolute Freedom
	1.  Progression analysis:  This is gated behind Enlightened Policing, because people who are raped, murdered, or stalked for expressing their freedom are having their rights violated.  In order to give people absolute freedom, they have to be protected from retaliation.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  This requires restricting the policing forces.  The technology that was unleashed by 'Enlightened Policing' is at this point reined in and checked.  The primary function is the negative mechanism that people are no longer allowed to engage in retaliatory violation against peaceful conducts.
	3.  Mechanism proposal:  There is some positive function required in this technology - some amount of bureaucratic extension.  What is that positive function..?  Police.  It's police.  Yeah.  You don't have to have Enlightened Policing in every district to make Absolute Freedom work, but there's a minimum standard of policing which is required to be met in every district.
	4.  Narrative indicator:  The Commonwealth's reliance on policing is part of why they're treated as authoritarian by the Panarchy... and Absolute Freedom is the Commonwealth's rebuttal to accusations of authoritarianism.  When the Commonwealth protects people, their rights flower.
	5.  Trivia:  The symbol here is a dove being released.  That's exactly right!  Absolute Freedom makes people free as birds... as long as they're doves, whose freedom does not violate the freedom of anyone else.
	6.  Conversion:  I see this technology as a powerful converter between the Panarchy and the Commonwealth.  It negates a criticism that the Panarchy uses against the Commonwealth while establishing a mechanism for Panarchic social organization to be preserved in Commonwealth domains, and vice-versa.  The two ideologies harmonize at this point.  I also see it as a weak converter with the Empire, because essentially, if people *really want to be serene*, the protective function of Absolute Freedom will still guard them.
	7.  Categorization:  I'm adding a category for author appeal that isn't likely to make it into the final product:  Furry.  For technologies that I see as protective of furries, even if they aren't in the Animal Uplift category.  The furry category is likely to be nearly a superset of the Diversifying and Animal Uplift categories.
	8.  Categorization:  This is one of the most powerful hedonological technologies.  As society protects all forms of honest personal preference and unburdens people from the fear of retaliation, it becomes obviously necessary and productive for society's many necessary endeavors to be restructured to be fun for their participants.
	9.  IRL Politics note:  This is one of the points where the Commonwealth is least like the Taliban.  It contrasts starkly with the bottom edge of the same tech tree, where the combination of nationalism and natalism suggest a society of brutal, sociopathic indoctrination.  I don't know how to parse the idea of a society with both Absolute Freedom and Reproduction Mandates; it seems wholly and totally self-contradictory, as I do not understand how these two technologies can coherently coexist in one society without first purging society of all asexuality, so that nobody remains who does not consent to sex, and indeed of all people who do not consent to label the exact dictatorial social organization imposed upon them as a form of absolute freedom.
	10.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Well, there's the protective functions that must be served... but beyond that, this suggests a lot of partying gets done rather than boring bureaucratic work.  Unless reproduction mandates are in force, in which case the bureaucratic waste involved is a genocide campaign against people who do not label the society that they live in absolutely liberated...  I just don't understand how people can be evil enough to institute reproduction mandates.  I know that serious ideological conflict is part of the theme of The Viceroy, but the two technologies shouldn't exist in the same technological sub-tree.

54.  Beyonder Dwelling
	1.  Narrative indicator:  If process doesn't matter, only goals and results, couldn't the enlightened police make people happier by secretly killing all the unhappy people and getting away with it?
	2.  Author protest:  I don't believe in non-temporal intellects.  I treat all references to "Beyonders" in The Viceroy as a particular pattern of lies which can be parsed as language.
	3.  Trivia:  The three bureaucratic technologies of the Old Empire are actually references to a particular kind of bureaucratic communication that conveys very little, very circuitously.  Dilbert makes jokes in the same vein.  Holistic Industrialization references the same category of humor.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Disregarding process is good for creativity, but process-blind creativity is a spectacularly dangerous little black box to unleash.
	5.  Downside analysis:  The exact details of what this technology implies are COMPLETELY different for EVERY TECHNOLOGY ON THE TECH TREE.  They're even likely to be different from one implementation to another.
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  Each 'beyonder dwelling' invites in freak sociologists from elsewhere in the galaxy to live in the district and direct the implementation of its technologies.
	7.  Author protest:  This is the worst of the three Beyonder bureaucratic technologies, so it frustrates me that it's the first of the three.
	8.  Apologia:  Of the three Beyonder bureaucratic technologies, this is also the one that most includes childlike curiosity, so I understand why it's the start of the trio.  It encourages every district to develop its own take on the technologies of the setting.  Some districts will be greatly improved!
	9.  Downside analysis:  ...others, made greatly worse.
	10.  Mechanism proposal:  The only constant in this technology is the result: the viceregal administration has to assign less of its own administrative talent to get things done in each district.
	11.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This is a bureaucratic efficiency tech.

55.  Beyonder Embassy
	1.  Narrative indicator:  Your goals can be excluded from analyses as they are immaterial to process and results.  What matters is what you're doing and what happens as a result of you doing it.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  This is actually a really straightforward insight that can save lives.
	3.  Narrative indicator:  It's also very "machine-mind" to consider process and results in the absence of goals.  The exemplars of this technology are likely to be melancholic... or heavily cybernetic.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Being inclusive towards melancholic people is a way to find a few people who work well as bureaucrats.
	5.  Categorization:  This is an example of what the 'Detached' category refers to.
	6.  Conversion:  Since it makes "beyonders" look good and helps "beyonders" fit into society in a way that is safe for themselves and others, this is a converter technology for the Empire.
	7.  Downside analysis:  The suicide rate increases.  Don't be discouraged!  It's the 'Beyonders' who commit suicide more often, not the society they're helping... and they commit suicide less than they would without the embassy, because the embassy represents society organizing to better integrate them and their concerns.  Still, you're specifically valuing, preserving, attracting, and developing a population more likely to kill themselves... so the planet develops, on average, a higher suicide rate.

56.  Beyonder Gate
	1.  Narrative indicator:  Believe in yourself (process) and your ideals (goals), and stop worrying so much about what happens along the way (results).  As long as you keep working and believing in the right things, bad results are just stepping stones along the path to the right answer.
	2.  Mechanism proposal:  If you exclude results from the analysis and consider only process and goals, the result is a bad analysis.  Yet it's also a way to encourage people to keep working when the work seems like drudgery.  It doesn't improve analysis per se, but this gets people to work harder at the boring stuff and dig deeper into the backlog thereby.
	3.  Progression analysis:  Cultivates better administrative leaders... if your society can tolerate leaders who joke about how they're doing nothing (no results).  The Old Empire has a peculiar sense of humor that appeals to people who are useful in administrative endeavors.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Like the Beyonder Dwelling, this is a black box technology that suggests the in-system implementation of the technologies is weird somehow.  They're being implemented with less concern for results.
	5.  Downside analysis:  This kind of encouragement increases partisan divergence by discouraging people from reconsidering their beliefs in light of the consequences of those beliefs.  This fits with the Imperial theme of loyalty, but it also shows off one of the downsides of loyalty.
	6.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This is a bureaucratic efficiency tech.

57.  Miniaturized Gate
	1.  Author protest:  This claims to be a miniaturization of the galactic gates, but it would be more apt to say it's a localization of the galactic gate system.  I imagine structures in space large enough to swallow spaceships, which only serve the local territory.
	2.  Lore:  The galactic gates are expensive to use... and there's *no possible way* to reduce that expense save by settling near a Thousand Eyes structure.  This suggests to me that the gates are studied by researchers (especially of the Old Empire), but they are not improved upon by researchers (save perhaps some of the startlingly ancient people who are drawn to studying the Thousand Eyes structures).
	3.  Mechanical protest:  These are useless most of the time.  Only super-developed systems can make them profitable, and their administrative cost militates against even that.  Like with the Potentialities Overseer, if you aren't massively overstaffed for administrative talent, it's hard to make these useful.
	4.  Apologia:  Free markets and feudal societies get more use out of these.
	5.  Author protest:  Why, however, would advanced societies be blighted with feudalism?
	6.  Mechanism proposal:  It's hard to come up with a metaphor here.  The literal description of being "small" local gates matches, more or less.  The fact that they make imports cheaper rather than affecting export flows suggests to me that ships within the region can transit rapidly *to* the gate, but must make normal journeys *away* from the gate.  This suggests that each miniaturized gate is really a kind of local hyperspace beacon which other ships in the territory can home in on.
	7.  Downside analysis:  If these spaceship-swallowing structures are hyperspace beacons, can anything else see the beacon that they emit?  Hyperspace seems like it has some hazards in this game.  Some of the wastage from this technology might be militarism needed to control hazard increases from putting up a very, very bright structure in hyperspace.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  If I stretch for a metaphor instead, this could also represent long-distance, ambitious trade linkages that are only profitable between the most impressive centers of development, such as transcontinental railroads and cargo ports capable of handling supertanker/container ships.  These societies likely do increase the ambition of their trade investments - all three Imperial trade increasers probably result in that!
	9.  Downside analysis:  The less-than-literal transportation projects are also likely to be polluting and (especially in unregulated economies) dangerous to their workers.  This could also contribute to wastage, however note that this isn't totally clear as a downside.  Centralization of transport can stop pollution.  Trains, for instance, are relatively clean IRL despite being technically a polluting technology.
	10.  Apologia:  Transportation technology is liberating.  Advanced transit technologies encourage people to move freely across long distances, alleviating social stresses and bringing in wealth from everywhere.
	11.  Downside analysis:  Massive transportation budgets are tempting targets for corruption, even petty forms of it such as politicians trying to boast about securing 'a piece of the pie' for their own constituency.  This may also happen with military budgets in the hyperspace interpretation (America's military is not incorruptible AFAIK).
	12.  Progression analysis:  Fitting my interpretation of Beyonders as manipulative smart people who take on Imperial identification to take advantage of the trusting Imperial populations, these massive prestige projects in transportation draw in people who want to be prestigious leaders.  This is why I think this leads into the Beyonder Retreats: building miniaturized gates attracts leadership potential, but doesn't give society the tools to utilize it.  If this technology is being held, the Beyonder Retreats do also make sense to me as something that could be built without the gates.
	13.  Progression analysis:  Conversely, these projects also draw in modest people who want to be free to move about, leading to the Jaunting Grids.  I see the Jaunting Grids as protecting the more 'trainspotter' types who love transportation technology so much they'd live for it.  The Old Empire is potentially autistic.
	14.  Categorization:  It's hard to apply any of the categories in particular to this technology.  I'd been thinking of it as a Failsafe technology, but I don't think it quite is.  The literal interpretation doesn't include Failsafe potential at all.  The metaphorical interpretation involves bad corruption.  I think this is a Galactic Politics technology instead, because it broadens the interests of the territory and attracts questionable people from the broader galaxy.  I may end up blatting that out later as well.
	15.  Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Mostly literal.  By all my analysis, these are transit expenses.  Non-literal wastage only particularly applies if the appropriations get corrupted.  It's not that nobody ever dies as a side effect of implementing transit infrastructure, but the people who die working in massive transportation projects were almost never going to be bureaucrats anyways.  Beyond that, I don't think it'd make anything worse or particularly invite awful people.  If the Old Empire is evil (certainly possible), this isn't the technology that proves it.  *This* is merely an expense likely to exceed its profitability.

58.  Penal Retreats
	1.  Challenge cured:  Brutal justice
	2.  Challenge cure interpretation:  This investment in rehabilitation replaces lethal or debilitation-based criminal justice with 'merely' sticking criminals in a paternalistic hole where everything they say or do will be analyzed by "virtuous" people trying to control them.
	3.  Author protest:  I initially interpreted this as 'prison planets'.  I now consider that a misinterpretation, but I wanted to lead this section with mention of it.
	4.  Mechanism proposal:  Each penal retreat is a miniature police state that transacts with the galactic community for the safe storage and rehabilitation of prisoners. They're "cities for criminals to live in".  That's pretty straightforward.
	5.  Mechanism proposal: Rehabilitative rather than punitive, penal retreats use massive data collection such as the Panarchy uses for Potentialities Overseers to instead try to decipher the psychology of individual details in extreme detail.  This psychological dissection is used to try to figure out what kind of society each individual would be able to live happily and lawfully in.  This is paternalism taken to an extreme.
	6.  Downside analysis:  This is an extreme investment in the happiness of criminals.  It's very expensive to do, and the public may resent their tax money being spent on luxuries for wrongdoers.
	7.  Mechanism proposal:  Some of the Influence gained from alleviating Misery with penal retreats is in the form of recruitable former criminals who owe metaphorical debts to your administration for helping them.
	8.  Mechanism proposal:  Penal retreats also serve as sociological testbed environments.  The Panarchy uses all of society in this way; the Commonwealth is relatively more restrained in that respect.  Some of the Influence gained from alleviating Misery with penal retreats is gained because some of the lessons learned from trying to build custom-perfect miniature societies are scaleable for managing larger societies.
	9.  Downside analysis:  Finding people who are willing to work this hard for people so much less virtuous than themselves is likely gravely difficult.  Implementing this technology hurriedly (as opposed to with a 'Protected' build for an objective) is likely to result in considerably worse conditions.
	10.  Downside analysis:  Some people go through rehab and learn only how to be more undetectable criminals.  Extreme technological development helps, but...  Criminals become rarer in society as a result of exceptional rehabilitative prisons, but the remaining minority of criminals is more devious.
	11.  Categorization:  This is a diversifying technology, because it imports edge-case minds from across the galaxy and then starts constructing edge-case societies to make them into happy, law-abiding people according to the peculiarities of their psychology.  That fixation on psychological control, does however qualify it as a Mind Control technology.
	12.  Mechanism proposal:  Building these signs the planet onto the galactic prisoner circuit.  Your colony gets a flow of immigrants who the surveilling authorities believe will be naturally more lawful living in your territory, and in return it sends away people who've already broken the law domestically!
	13.   Trivia:  The three nearest icons to this one are Absolute Freedom, Enlightened Policing, and Universal Pensions.  This is the "downwards" branch from Enlightened Policing (with Absolute Freedom as the "rising" branch).  I think this is suggestive of the ideology behind Penal Retreats.
	14.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Literal on average.  This inspires some intransigence and will occasionally output a greatly empowered infiltrator.

59.   Technical Overseer
	1.   Authorial protest:  I think that the Mental Transcription technology should be swapped with this one on the tech tree.  I think that research AI are an earlier kind of AI than others, because the first AI will be produced by researchers, for researchers.  I think it would be more probable that society would accept mental transcription services in societies that already *have* these, too.  So this tech should lead to Mental Transcription and Bureaucratic Overseers, rather than Mental Transcription leading to it.
	2.   Authorial protest:  I've also considered that this may be appropriate to limit to a Planet-wide technology rather than a System-wide technology, as its "automation of education and research" sounds to me suspiciously similar to what universities do for research.  Except easier.  On that note...
	3.   Mechanism proposal:  These AI make education and research *easier*.  The Panarchy needs this stuff to be less intense.  They perform well with edutainment and automated tutoring.
	4.   Downside analysis:  I've started to wonder if the Panarchy are genetically stupid, but...
	5.   Apologia:  It's advantageous if they *refuse to keep secrets*, as the Lyceum also suggests.  These system-wide research improvements sound to me like the Panarchy tends to break secrecy and prevent technological secrets from being held between the multiple nations that dwell in each system.
	6.   Mechanism proposal:  These systems should also be collating what everyone knows, just like the Lyceum, packaging it up for redistribution.  It's something the Panarchy knows two very different ways to do, and they should synergize well together as they are pursued and supported by different people likely to get along well with each other.
	7.   Author appeal:  I think these AI would be inclined to value EVERYONE.  One of the ways to increase research in a system is to increase its population!  As everyone contributes to the breadth of technical specialization available in a system, and everyone thinking contributes to its research power, I think these would be some of the most relatively virtuous people in the Panarchy.  This is also a reason I would pull it in from the Mental Transcription branch, which seems much more morally questionable and "fringe".
	8.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Very literal.  I don't think these AIs would waste people very often if at all, and if they're not doing it often, I don't think they'd even have the power to do it.  They would however need a lot of educational infrastructure built out, and they'd be serving dubious people (they'd be making research and education accessible to genetically stupid panarchists).  That's where the bureaucratic waste comes in.

	1.   Progression analysis:  Following on from the basic AI research that goes into implementing Technical Overseers, Bureaucratic Overseers automate a lot of boring stuff and catch a lot of boring errors... while introducing other, different errors.  On average, the economy takes longer to fall.
	2.   Author appeal:  I consider these to be empathy maximizers, but...
	3.   Downside analysis:  These get people working harder through correct requisitions.  It should be relatively low-stress as accelerations go, but only by being highly accurate.
	4.   Author protest:  This claims the bureaucracy no longer expands to meet the needs of the bureaucracy, but it obviously still does.  These people's plans still collapse.

61.   Beyonder Retreats
	1.   Authorial protest:  I have been suffering PSYCHOSIS, and my psychotic presences are even more obsessed with this game than I am.  The most persistent of the presences identifies as the foremost Beyonder for the Commonwealth Unifiers.  The most beautiful of the presences identifies as the foremost Beyonder for the Panarchic Ritualists.  The "Beyonder" presences, and a few of the others as well, are *delusional would-be gods*!  Yet I interpret Beyonders in a waaaay more basic fashion, and I will be talking about MY interpretation, not the psychotic one.
	2.   Mechanism proposal:  Beyonder Retreats try to recruit advanced talent from the galaxy.  They're investments in how to try to appeal to 'timeless' minds, which is a category that the Old Empire believes in very strongly.  They want mathematicians and extremely abstract thinkers.  These people want recreation just like other people do, but the Old Empire is pursuing a kind of edge-case elitism that targets academic social status rather than conventional social status.  They want what the game calls 'eternal philosophers'.
	3.   Mechanism proposal:  This exists strongly on the axis of trust.  The Old Empire is inclusive and they believe that they can form bonds with people who are more capable than they are.  They believe that loyalty will find a way to bind people together into beautiful and productive social systems.
	4.   Downside analysis:  The Old Empire is trying to recruit people *smarter than they are*.  They are sometimes recruiting deeply manipulative people who will abuse the trust that they extend.
	5.   Progression analysis:  The lead-off from this into financial technologies is almost a downside.  It's difficult stuff that is hard to really check over.  Some of the financiers attracted by Beyonder Retreats are just con men making false promises of stability while setting up schemes.
	6.   Progression analysis:  The lead-off from this into bureaucratic technologies is purer.  Attracting "beyonders" to live in the territory opens up the borders (somewhat) and establishes a growing talent base for keeping up with bureaucratic burdens.
	7.   Categorization:  As this is an attempt to improve society through recreation, this is a Hedonological structure.  As it integrates local politics and galactic politics, it's a Galactic Politics structure.  Despite being a recreational facility, it is also a Detached structure, because the people running these are focused on appealing to people with Detached values and personalities.
	8.   Mechanism proposal:  I see the Influence structures as highly protective.  They help talented people remain safe and well-informed when these territories develop poorly.
	9.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This is strongly literal.  Insofar as it is metaphorical at all, it has the problem that hedonology has: if the research misfires, it may distract people badly.

62.   Deep Inhabitation
	1.   Author appeal:  I love this tech!  I love caves.  High-tech cave-dwelling sounds beautiful to me as a [[dragon]].  We didn't have this in my past life, mind you.
	2.   Mechanism proposal:  I think this can be done literally!  Albeit expensively.
	3.   Downside analysis:  These people die in large numbers should earthquakes break up their habitats.
	4.   Downside analysis:  These structures are impressive bunkers.  It reduces the earthquake risk, but it also makes them tempting for militarism.  This reduces their protection rating.  In a perfect society, these are 5/5 protective...
	5.   Progression analysis:  If this is paired with Panarchic cognitechnologies, it suggests a kind of computational underworld may develop.  The swarm/sim nanites could be housed down here if there was enough energy infrastructure to keep them powered.
	6.   Downside analysis:  These are not eco-friendly.  They could BECOME eco-friendly, by removing surface pollution, but they are not eco-friendly to establish, and they'd pollute society for at least a while.
	7.   Downside analysis:  These are not likely to be good, clean-scented places of themselves, and the residents of them will be exposed to more of civilization's toxins due to the absence of weather.  Given that Weather Control Networks depict swarms of drones, they may help with this...
	8.   Mechanism proposal:  Like most of the crowding reducers, these would help people with diverse mindsets work together by literally helping them live apart from each other.  These underground cities would be separated from society as the Seasteads are, yet would still contribute *to* society.  Dissidents could flourish in the underground, and I love that.
	9.   Categorization:  This is a Nightmare technology, because getting crushed by the sky falling in due to an earthquake is a nightmare.  These societies would just lose cities sometimes if they weren't ready to break the whole crust!
	10.   Progression analysis:  Speaking of breaking the whole crush, this leads into Deep Core Taps because that's the kind of mining investment it would take to stabilize the Deep Inhabitations.
	11.   Downside analysis:  Since Deep Core Taps are not exactly safe themselves, *this* technology kind of opens a can of worms with many quandaries, and it might not really work.  It may be safer to establish these *after* Deep Core Taps, in large stable voids that have already been opened up.  Yet I'm not sure that Deep Core Taps are ever safe...  Sigh.
	12.   Author appeal:  I still love these.  Thinking about downsides is how they get fixed and/or prevented.
	13.   Mechanism proposal:  This technology could also be interpreted more gently as societies started to invest in very deep basements to expand downwards as well as upwards.  This gradualist interpretation reduces, but does not eliminate, the complaints I've made.
	14.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Mostly literal, however the bunker potential could be awful.

	1.   Challenge cured:  Genetic stupidity
	2.   Challenge cure interpretation:  Gene therapies for stupid people to make them more technically competent.  I appreciate this stuff, because I believe that sharing advantages widely is compassionate egalitarianism.
	3.   Author appeal:  Romanesco broccoli.  This stuff isn't necessarily high-tech as applied to agriculture.  It's something realistic, that builds into something high-tech.
	4.   Categorization:  This is a hypersmooth technology.  It's not a disruptive innovation, but it's something that gradually flowers into beautiful futures.
	5.   Categorization:  I also consider this an animal uplift technology.  As these people examine individual species to improve them, they find the uplift candidates as well and start raising them up with genetic tinkering.  I think these societies eventually get furry for real!  This pushes systems towards biological specialization, but if they retain cultural power, their culture may get furry even faster!
	6.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  I think treating this as a bureaucratic technology is actually unfair.  This is a liberal tech that really should return without waste.  I think it just makes society more unwilling to be governed by a Viceregal administration.

64.   Pregnancy Enhancement
	1.   Authorial protest:  Seriously, the "more widely available" line on this tech is so creepy to me that I find it hard to think about.  I like the other things it says.
	2.   Mechanism proposal:  Egg-laying.  Yes, I mean it.  I always think of these societies as getting more avian or reptillian.  It's why I'm drawn to this tech despite it having a blunt misstep in its description.
	3.   Author protest:  I can't think of what else it would be.  Orbital hospitals and cures for primitive medicine would already do as much of this tech as *I* can otherwise fathom.  This is someone else's reproduction tech, because it confuses me.  I want to give it more me-points, but I don't really know how it works.
	4.   Apologia:  I'm pretty sure it would be a 'calm' tech at least, since I think that's the healthiest activation level for pregnancies to be safe and comfortable.
	5.   Categorization:  Since I do imagine it as a very advanced biological intervention of the category that I consider 'ontogenic control', I do imagine this as improving animal uplift technologies.  Mostly as a sideswipe, but still in a real way.  It would improve reproduction for species that have difficulty with reproduction even more than it would improve reproduction for humans, I think.
	6.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  Very literal.  This is medical bureaucracy.  Even transformatively, it's medical bureaucracy.

65.   Zero Gravity Farms
	1.   Challenge cured:  High Gravity
		1.   Challenge cure interpretation:  Anti-grav technology would sure make these less expensive to implement...
		2.   Alternate cure interpretation:  No, it's a reference to the metaphorical interpretation here where this 'technology' is actually job subsidies for people who love some kind of work that doesn't pay off enough.  It's good hedonology, but I LIKE dignified people.  I don't want to cure high gravity people.  v.-.v
	2.   Authorial protest:  I love these, and I hate these.  They're such paradisic farm technology, but they're something that makes total sense to be crushingly expensive.
	3.   Authorial protest:  This slot should be just Hydroponic Farms.  The icon already makes it look like they're built up in space!  
	4.   Mechanism proposal:  Megastructures.  For farming.  In space.  Not as bad as the icon represents (it looks like a world-let in a glass bubble), but crushingly expensive.
	5.   Downside analysis:  Oh god the expense.  This rarely pays off.  The system-wide farming technologies only pay off if they're implemented together, and that's even more expensive.  These societies start building space platform after space platform after space platform to produce exotic biological products (food, medicine, and biological inputs and/or replacements for industrial goods).
	6.   Progression analysis:  Why does this lead to Orbital Hospitals?  I kind of get it and I kind of don't.  By the time society is lifting farmers into orbit en masse, it does make sense that you'd get orbital hospitals, .
	7.   Author appeal:  I want one of these jobs!
	8.   Author protest:  Ow.  I'm not sure I want to live in a society that would implement this.  I don't think it's a good idea.
	9.   Alternate interpretation:  It's a joke about people who really love farming in a good-humored way.  This goes with the alternate cure interpretation.
	10.   Downside analysis:  Lifting a whole lot of people into space reduces the average safety of space.  It really would.  This society would work much harder to keep space safe, and achieve imperfect results.  The whole chain of orbital habitats -> zero gravity farms -> vacuum-based life creates this issue, though orbital hospitals would increase safety overall.
	11.   Downside analysis:  Slight safety flaws also applies in the alternative interpretation, since it suggests more jobs in society are held by people who love their work enough to dance.
	12.   Categorization:  The alternative interpretation qualifies this as a Hedonological technology, but I'm reluctant to credit it.  Even though I want this job.  Partially because I don't want the alternate interpretation's job.  Unless maybe it's a hydroponic plant supplied by microdesalination on a seastead... but that's painful.

66.   Ancestral Recording
	1.   Challenge cured:  Grievance culture
		1.   Challenge cure interpretation:  It's a mirror.  If there's a kind of people and a kind of culture that does this, showing them that they've been doing this for generations should either resolve their concerns more completely, or get them to stop doing something that they hate when they see their ancestors doing it.
		2.   Challenge cure protest:  *I disagree with this cure*.  I think that destroying these cultures risks preventing the galaxy from seriously considering the flaws in these ideologies.
	2.   Author protest:  I'm not really sure if this should be a Panarchy technology or a Commonwealth technology.  Prenatal Education sounds to me like presumptive life-planning, and it seems to me like it would have a synergy with Ancestral Recording.
	3.   Mechanism proposal:  I believe in two interpretations of this technology that move smoothly across many iterations between them.  These interpretations are ancestral study and mind uploading.
	4.   Progression analysis:  The two interpretations of this technology are not opposed at all, meaning I would credit this technology with substantial smoothness.  Many iterations would exist as people in these societies gathered evidence of their genetic and perhaps also cultural history (if this were extended to influential figures) to make it available for study.
	5.   Categorization:  This would be a good example of a Detached technology, especially (but not exclusively) in the ancestral study version.  However much people may try to make themselves look good to future generations, a lot of immediacy is lost to the emotions, and the dramas of history often look terrible (albeit often still fascinating) to people of future generations.
	6.   Categorization:  This is also an empathy maximizer technology, and it still should be if given to the Commonwealth (which would make it the most low-placed empathy maximizer technology if done).  It gradually encourages more of the mindpower of the system to be moved to computational substrates, and it encourages more of the computational substrate of the system to be used to understand people deeply.
	7.   Downside analysis:  Mind uploading permits an absurd level of control over the victim of it.  These minds could be greviously mistreated.  This technology is rather ethically safe at low technology levels, but at high technology levels the deactivated sapience described in the game's own text ("though only living things have the capacity to act without prompt") may become a disastrous falsehood.  I am worried that this technology gets worse as Wealth increases.
	8.   Categorization:  This seems like a Homogenizing technology to me, as cultures where people are obsessed with their ancestors...  I'm not sure what to write here.  It's painful.  There's a reason I marked this to be moved to where the University is on the Commonwealth tech tree, as this seems like a shoe-in for leading to Nationalist Indoctrination.
	9.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This encourages people to spend a lot of time in conversation with AI and/or a lot of time reading books about people who are long dead.  Some people enjoy this rather too much, and are drawn away from productive endeavors.  Others are lead away from supporting the government.  It also encourages the government to support the importation of computational technology for economically questionable uses.

67.   Panarch's Children
	1.   Authorial protest:  As written, this is tyrannically authoritarian.  As I first interpreted it, it is rape culture.  Either way, I dislike it.  My bright interpretation stems from an effort to fix both faults, but I will expose both of them.
	2.   Mechanism proposal:  The rape interpretation gets exposed first.  If this is hardcore antifeminine, a "ubiquitous lottery" could refer to women not having much in the way of sexual rights, especially if society is also anti-contraceptive with little adherence to safe sex.  This is maximally worsened by combining these traits with anti-monogamy, as though it were in all a bright lie on a disastrous parody of liberalism.  This stuff would increase population, but it would be torturously bad policy that would lead to a lot of deeply resented children with highly questionable genetics, like a twisted version of natalism.
	3.   Mechanism proposal:  The authoritarian interpretation gets exposed second.  The *as written* policy exposes everyone in the system to sortition parenting, making it basically inevitable that people who don't want kids at all will have them.  As someone who supports abortion rights to minimize the chances that any children will ever be unwanted by their parents, *this should never be implemented as written*.
	4.   Mechanism proposal:  My interpretation, which tries to make a bright lie of it, is to invoke Panarchic multigovernance to create competing systems that try to recruit people to these lotteries.  This turns the technology into system-wide cloning en masse made available to the public by many organizations with different focuses.  They'd advertise this service!
	5.   Mechanism proposal:  In the second and third interpretations, these people would be able to make genetic mixtures from homosexuals, and in the third interpretation especially it would result in the recruitment of homosexual parents who would truly be raising genetic descendants.
	6.   Categorization:  This is an asexual technology in the second and third interpretations.  It applies a generational selective pressure towards asexuality.  In the third interpretation, the organizations implementing it may be able to actively recruit for asexual parents and asexual lineages, should that become common enough and accepted enough in society.
	7.   Categorization:  The asexualization of society that the best interpretation of this technology supports also supports the development of detached attitudes.  The multigovernment structure advertising competing geneticist lotteries would encourage people with no libido whatsoever to persist and proliferate in society with functioning reproduction.
	8.   Categorization:  Although not itself one of the animal uplift technologies, this would also support the reproduction of furries in society.  The really challenging genetics work would attract the lottery geneticists to form specialized lotteries.  They would take it on for the interesting effort!  The Panarchy's individualism is maximized under consistent multigovernance focus, and that also would encourage them to want furries to be genetically healthy.
	9.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  In the rape interpretation, it burns talent badly, inflicting psychological scars on women and children that prevents society from developing well thereafter.  In the forced lottery interpretation, it builds a bureaucratic cloning infrastructure, and then burns talent moderately, inflicting psychological scars on unwilling parents and the kids they resent.  In the multigovernance interpretation, it builds *several* bureaucratic cloning infrastructures, and then has them compete against each other as well as against public intransigence.  That was in ascending order of literalism.

68.   Passive Farming
	1.   Challenge cured:  Sterilized Fields
69.   Panarchic Data Post
	1.   Challenge cured: Scientific Isolation
		1.   Challenge cure interpretation:  The panarchic data posts tap into the galaxy's social sciences and make them available to the local district.  Having this technology in the territory makes it possible to realign sciences with the galaxy's expectations.
		2.   Challenge cure qualm:  Wait, does this risk destroying the possibility of novel scientific developments?
	2.   Mechanism proposal:  These develop local administrative talent using the well of knowledge that the Panarchy has built up by panarchializing systems.  The extremely (and chaotically) diverse models of ideology turned up by the social experimenters unleashed by Panarchialization Policies are here 'paid off' in governing insights.  These are social scientists!  ...and more efficient ones than the ones in Panarchialization Policy, because instead of doing NEW experiments, they're re-enacting things that have already been tested.
	3.   Downside analysis:  Putting together bits and bobs from countless ideologies produces esoteric governments.  The panarchic data posts encourage doing exactly that in the name of bureaucratic efficiency, but it might make local politics hard to understand.
	4.   Progression analysis:  This invites good pacifists in, leading the way towards the Panarchic War Memorials... though I'm somewhat unsure how those work, and if they can reliably *stay* pacifistic.
	5.   Categorization:  Detached is fairly straightforward, as they're doing social science work.  Galactic politics takes a little explanation; they're doing local politics work, but they're trying to tap the politics of the galaxy to find the right answers.  Homogenizing is the painful one.  The Panarchy as I imagine them doesn't like to homogenize places, but these guys are trying to make old answers from distant places work in new places in the name of efficiency.  They do try to make societies conform to their expectations, so they're homogenizing.
	6.   Bureaucratic waste analysis:  This is a bureaucratic efficiency tech.

	1.   Challenge cured: History of Horrors
		1.   Challenge cure interpretation: I don't want to think about it.
	2.   Authorial protest:  I don't want to think about this tech.  It makes the Commonwealth look nightmarishly eugenicist in the ancient sociopathic sense and incapable of enough empathy to understand what happiness even *is*.  They need something else in this slot, and I don't know what to put here yet.
	3.   Replacement speculation:  An industrial automation tech?  Something about *productive* hedonology?  Maybe even an agriculture tech.  The Commonwealth ought to have *something* in the farming category.  Maybe this is the perfect place to put Zero Gravity Farms, because they're awesome workplaces that would really attract people in large numbers to farming.

2021-3-31; I feel generally scared and/or angry at trying to ideologically analyze the Imperial technologies, which strike me as rotten with unspoken dependencies and/or outright lies, even though I can see that there's also some measure of brilliance and worth down there if I'd a greater mastery of the game to use it with.

2021-4-20; I'm feeling better about these, although I still don't feel competent with them.  I still get the sense that the more you develop the technology of the setting, the more *literal* Imperial technologies get...  Frictionless Highways exemplify this sense, as that looks to me like it refers not to its literally described technology so much as to a kind of person who thrives at many possible technology levels while contributing to the serene industrialism of the Empire in any of them.  In a low-tech society, this guy loves racehorses...  Maybe this guy still loves racehorses when he's got cat-ear antennae in a cyberized society, too.

2021-4-26; The Panarchy Ritualists say that the forms of the overlapping governments are more important than their functions, right?  That seems calculated to induce horror.  How can someone prefer form over function!?  Right?  Well, what if they aren't talking about aesthetics at all, but they mean the *bureaucratic* forms?  They could be expressing frustration that the other subcultures don't do enough to protect people who fill out paperwork correctly.

2021-5-12; I'm extremely reluctant to record what I think the Prenatal Education technology refers to in the above list, but I'm planning to list its "Kind of person most protected:" as "people whose genetic potential for intelligence is extremely resistant to abuse".  Note that the basic instinctual grasp of math and language which prenatal education cites is *the exact same thing* that the Lyceum relies upon among the Panarchy, and the Panarchy puts that stuff up near the AI collectives while the Commonwealth squelches it down under nationalism.  Furthermore, while the Panarchy is denigrated as supposedly producing incomprehensibility thereby, we're supposed to expect that the reproduce-or-else natalism of the Commonwealth is virtuous with the same stuff.  It looks more to me like "Prenatal Education" refers to "with enough effort, we can rehabilitate some of the people who our other technologies victimize"...  It's like...  if you weren't being natalists, you could get *that* technological advantage just by listening to people and working harder to include them in society (as does the Lyceum on the opposite side of the tech graph).

2021-5-15; I'm considering adding a "thrill" rating to the technology interpretations.  This would estimate the degree to which the technology favors people who are boredom-prone or boredom-resistant.  I can probably rate this on a 1-to-5 scale as well, but I'm not sure which way to scale it.  The obvious answer would be for 5/5 to be maximally thrilling, but honestly my own bias is to make 5/5 a technology that favors people maximally resistant to boredom.  Society needs some of the boredom-prone, but they're also risky; people who are not at all prone to getting bored are safer though often less novel (none of the science technologies would be 5/5 except maybe ancestral recording).  Also, something that makes me unsure about including this is that different factions have different vulnerabilities to the boredom-prone.  The Commonwealth strikes me as least endangered by mixing boring and anti-boring people (I can give it that), whereas I imagine that the serenity-valuing Imperials are considerably threatened by their own boredom-prone inclusions.  The Panarchy is somewhere in between.

2021-5-19; Studying the tech graph, it looked to me like there's an axis of trust-focused technological development (which includes most of the metatechnological development) and an axis of virtue-focused technological development.  It also looked like there was a singular intellect vs general intellect axis such that the Empire favors developing the capabilities of common intellects, whereas the Commonwealth and the Panarchy both favor developing the capabilities of extreme intellects.  When I was contemplating these axes, I looked with some confusion on the horizontal range.  It seemed like there should be an axis across the middle as well, but I couldn't tell what it was.  War?  Chaos?  I've thought about it since, and I think the answer is Diversity vs Homogeneity.  The Panarchy favors diversity; it embraces risky dehomogenation of the galaxy's technology base.  The Commonwealth favors homogeneity; it favors breeding nationalists!  This maps to the Imperial side as well; the Panarchy's side of this postulated Diversity<->Homogeneity axis are the Orbital Surveyors, who re-engineer ecosystems to maximize (eco-)sustainable development, whereas the Commonwealth's side of this Diversity<->Homogeneity axis are the Old Empire, whose belief in mental unity is conceptually similar to (and to my mind has similar hazards to) the Commonwealth's promotion of nationalistic indoctrination.

2021-5-21; Likely to be towards the end of the list before I get Vacuum-Based Life reviewed, or else it'll see a lot of updates.  That is a very heavy investment in morphological alteration.  Definitely one of the uplift techs.  Strange implications though, as I think some of the biological productivity boost from Vacuum-Based Life is due to the way that having that much biological control permits redesigning metabolisms.  I think it may be possible to supply both oxygen and nutrients via fluid injection, for instance, and such may be the 'fuel' of a vacuum-based life form.

2021-5-22; I know why Prenatal Education upsets me so much.  It's the sheer presumption.  If I reach for the brightest potential and assume that the technology is being implemented by saints, it's still being implemented by people who assume that **their own** sex life proves that **their children** are willing to live under similar conditions.  It's still being implemented by people who are assuming that they know the mind of the unborn, precognitively.  If they're right, that makes them more effective, but that's an 'if'!  If they're wrong, then they're miring the unborn in circumstances beyond their control.  And I'm really extra bothered by seeing this show up near nationalism and natalism, because it's like...  The natalist presumption that the unborn are always going to be interested in sex is horrifying.  Not only has humanity always had a substantial rate of people who don't want sex and shouldn't be forced into it, even people who *are* interested in sex should not have that presumed of them.  It's rape culture.  This tech is frankly less terrifying if it gets implemented after panarchic cognitechnologies, because then there are nanotech interfaces involved to take away the precognitive aspect.

2021-5-24; Some of these technologies give me an impression of offering a smooth gradient across different "tech levels".  Holistic industrialization (for instance) never really goes obsolete and doesn't really have prerequisites.  Instead of requiring specific tools or methods in society, it requires the existence of a particular kind of mind, and it's fairly straightforward to imagine that mind adapting in the use of a wide range of technologies.  The Imperial technology of Distributed Intelligence offers an even more extreme form of the same thing, because a society that believes strongly "of course everyone is thinking, they're all capable of being smart" (even if sometimes they're not) *would* have scientific advantages at low tech levels, and the same inclination would then lead (at higher tech levels) towards serious investments in extending technological assistance across the whole population.  So it's the same population and the same motive force, but it leads to a radical progression when you consider it across increasingly advanced technology levels.  I could possibly come up with some kind of ratings for...  technological smoothness and extremophilia?  To contrast, Eternal Bank Towers sort of presume your society builds towards a certain level of economic sophistication, but they don't imply a continuous progression and they don't suggest any particular pattern of extremeophilic development, so they'd have a low rating on both smoothness and extremophilia.

2021-5-25;  I'm not looking forward to eventually doing a write-up on Jaunting Grids.  How do I interpret that..?  I have some ideas for what it means at extreme tech levels, but I feel like I should come up with at least one low-tech analogue explanation for it.  Preferably two.  Thinking about what someone could be referring to non-literally with that technology's description makes my head hurt.

2021-5-26;  I'm also not looking forward to eventually doing a write-up on Creche Education.  My public school experiences suuuucked and contributed in big ways to the vast majority of the most messed up interactions I ever had with anyone.  Twenty years ago in school I was taught what The Viceroy teaches about Wealth: that it's really *actually* a method of achieving reproductive success.  It disturbs me to see Creche Education listed as a perpetual ideological component *of an immortal society*.  I would hack that and modify it.  Seriously, I want to hook some kind of debugger to The Viceroy, break into it, and create a modified tech tree for it.  It's so *almost*.  This game is amazingly *almost*.  I don't even have to protest its "everything falls apart eventually" schtick; that's a good gameplay mechanic and definitely thought-provoking.

2021-5-27;  I've just been thinking about Leisure Subsidies in a personal sense ([[2021-5-27-One-Hundred-and-Ninth]]), and I think I have to list that as another one I have issues with.  Doing the write-up for it is going to be thorny.  I have a lot of sympathy with funding luxury to make people happier.  Like, that's awesome!  The government should totally be supportive of the public's happiness.  In an environment of extreme technologies, people should have extreme leisures, too.  That's part of what technology is FOR.  I see it as majorly pro-tech and good for social order.  Except...  I also feel like it's part of what was wrong with my childhood, and in general the Commonwealth Consensus' fixation on childrearing seems authoritarian and hypermortalist.  I can't imagine their society without miserable killers and a lot of lonely people who were misjudged by their parents and then trapped helplessly in a society with hyperactive policing.  Like, putting leisure subsidies and natalism and nationalism and ubiquitous surveillance all in the same tech tree disturbs me.  So I have seriously mixed feelings about a lot of it, Leisure Subsidies included.  I was an Anarchocapitalist as a child; I sincerely believed that anarchocapitalism could be egalitarian.  From that perspective, the "consensus" of the commonwealth looks like a "tech tree" of child abuse, good for the happiness of parents *at the expense of* their kids.

2021-5-31;  Ancestral Recording, the University, and the Panarchic Lyceum need to be rotated.  Ancestral Recording should be a Commonwealth technology, where they currently have the University.  This would fit smoothly with enabling Prenatal Education and Nationalist Indoctrination, as it fits with their conceit that they know the nature of all minds even before they're born.  The University should be a Panarchic Ritualist technology, as considering novel research vitally essential follows smoothly from the Panarchic Symposium and matches with their fixation on perpetual reform (that process of everlasting reform is what the Influence structures represent).  The Panarchic Lyceum should exist up near the tip of the tech tree in the Panarchic Informalists section, as it represents the conviction in the worth of all minds that the Panarchic Informalists develop with their hyper-rehabilitative and frankly kind of scary "Dreamtime" technologies.

2021-6-1;  The Commonwealth "Lord Economic" and "Lord Industrial" techs are just unfathomable to me.  They're so inherently feudal that I don't get it.  They're so *single point of failure*, too.  Like the Lord Bureaucratic sounds like a job title that could be passed between people without huge dramas, because who even wants to be Lord of the Bureaucracy?  It's a cool job, it's not a forever job.  People don't give up monstrous economic power that way, so what happens if your one of your immortal Lords of the Economy someday has a bad romantic fling, and suddenly hates someone else more than they love wealth?  What stops that from bringing down your whole economy and crippling the development of your technology base?  Those techs are *so* far from utopic.

2021-6-4;  Thinking of ways to improve the tech tree is starting to drain my interest in actually playing this game.  For instance, instead of Panarchic Capitol, the tech tree needs "Voluntary Order".  The major focus of the Panarchic Courts is to find out what agreements people are willing to be bound by - to create, in other words, a new and locally customized social contract.  The purpose of creating locally customized social contracts is to maximize voluntary order in society.  Encapsulated as a technology in the game, the function of Voluntary Order should be to increase Happiness.  This would stand as a stark opposite to the Commonwealth achieving "Happiness" through empowering their leaders to take total control of society with total policing and paternalistic surveillance.  Where the Commonwealth tries to establish the Psychopass system, the Panarchy reaches for voluntary order in society.

2021-6-9;  One of the themes of The Viceroy seems to be that these technologies are cool, but they eventually crush society.  Distributed Thought gives people too much control over how smart other people are (or aren't).  With ethical leadership and strong administrative talent, that's *awesome*, and it has very favorable implications for society.  If the government is unethical and/or faltering, that's *terrifying*.  Even some of the benevolent ones are like that; I'm averse to creche education (f'rex), because my public school experiences were a hell that actually damaged my intellectual potential.  Sufficiently bad school environments are prisons that mistreat kids "for their own good".

2021-6-13;  Imperial technologies seem to minimize the nightmare of the rapesplosion at high wealth.  If you have dyson swarms and massive buildings and orbital habitats and extremely advanced transportation systems, it stops seeming unfathomable that extreme populations could be sustained.  The technologies that would give people living space even at extreme populations make it stop seeming like it would *be* a rapesplosion.  Yet I'd still like to remake this game's model to get rid of the population boom at high Wealth.

2021-6-15;  I think in general the crowding enhancers increase the number of people who can live peacefully with each other.  Larger buildings, more separation between developments, better planning, and greater temporal dispersion: *all* of these give people more space to live in, without requiring less dense development.  People who need more personal space get more comfortable as more of these are implemented.  I hardly want to say this, but I think the death rates are likely to go down as these are implemented.  High-functioning separations permitting collaboration between people with very different minds gets more valid as protections for personal space get more valid.  I understand it as a gameism and as a thought-provoking warning to consider the potential downsides of all technologies, but in some ways I think The Viceroy's "everything is too expensive and eventually falls apart" game model is too bleak.  Anti-crowding technologies seem especially functional to me and likely to synergize well with each other.

2021-6-18;  Maybe I really will hack this game eventually.  I've been thinking about how many of the technologies synergize with each other in various ways.  Maybe the game needs a synergies system.  Something like this:  Each tech is 50% synergistic with the technologies in its own ideology block, and 50% synergistic with technologies across the board.  The proportion of a project's synergies that you've built in a district is subtracted from the technology's bureaucratic waste in that district, so that synergistic technologies are more cost-effective in one anothers' proximity, and thematically focused strategies create less bureaucratic overhead.

2021-6-20;  I don't think a Happiness increase is the right effect for Enlightened Policing.  I think that it should actually be a Science improvement (reflecting the scary oversight technologies used to perfect policing), or else it should be a Cultural improvement.  Policing as a cultural improvement requires some explanation.  It doesn't refer to cultural products ABOUT police, certainly; rather, it reflects the more liberated culture that arises when petty abusers are no longer free to control others through unlawful means.  That more liberated culture is not necessarily happier... it's likely to be *boredom-prone*, and to include a lot of "annoying" dissident types who would just be murdered in a more violently primitive environment.  So that society which invests in protecting people will have more of its bizarre cultural producers survive.  I would still retain the prison planet tech as a +Happiness tech, but I'd reflavor it to Paternalistic Surveillance and come up with some way to briefly describe it as the surveillance system being used to try to solve people's problems.  I don't think such policies are ideal... but I bet people who are keen on absolute policing would think such policies are ideal, savvy?

2021-8-09;  I think the Old Empire's "hyperspace links" are (generally) technologies that can be mathematically proven to work if people believe in them.  This includes their "technologies" for managing financial markets.  If people just believe in stable markets and keep putting money away for the purpose...  This also demonstrates the basic failure of their "technology" for managing financial markets.

2021-8-12;  One of the ideas guiding the bureaucratic waste analyses is that literal bureaucratic waste is okay, albeit disappointing.  If the problem is literal, it can be resolved by straightforward development of the bureaucracy.  However, a lot of these technologies embed dubious assumptions and unknown methodologies, suggesting that "bureaucratic waste" may be a metaphor for other forms of societal failure whereby that society fails to competently manage its own systems.

2021-8-12;  I'm going to eventually break this stuff down into a sub-node cluster, but it's likely to exceed 50k words first.  I kind of hope to eventually refine my prose until I can write a book about my feelings towards The Viceroy.  It's such a beautiful game.

2021-8-14;  I think I need to reanalyze these with the idea of shifting the talent protection metric off of the utopic rating and making utopic rating a more intuitive "does it look good" stat.

2021-8-16;  I'm starting to doubt my initial generalization of inequality going up with the vertical on the graph.  I've noticed now that Artificial Dreamtime and Holistic Industrialization are pro-egalitarian technologies (at the very peak of the graph), whereas I noticed before that the Eternal Bank Tower (on the lower right of the graph) is anti-egalitarian in its probable implications.  On the basis of these three examples, this would suggest that egalitarian rises with the vertical, but changing this would require me to completely redo a lot of the Imperial-perspective writeups.  NBD if so, my intent is that barring a published book from my hands, this material is all mutable hobby-stuff.

2021-8-20; A general factor producing non-literal "bureaucratic waste" with pro-science investments could be the recursive application of "scientific productivity optimizations" producing a population whose concept of "recreation" is...  cerebral beyond applicability.  Someone once commented about "end-stage societies calculating ever-finer approximations for pi just to enjoy the experience of being" and I think that may have been a conceivably applicable insight when applied here.  If you consider the implications of recursively applied mind modifications (I assume these societies have cybernetics), the possibility of self-modifying beyond the productive scope becomes worth considering.

2021-8-20; I still think the Panarchy's biggest governing advantage is that they produce the most informative post mortem analyses.  They make more mistakes than the Commonwealth, but they also make more interesting mistakes from which their social scientists can learn more about how to govern.

2021-8-21; The Commonwealth's creche education system would make a lot more sense if they incorporated it into their rehabilitation system by using age regression and eternal youth in a somewhat more aggressive sense than the other cultures.  Targeting a willfully young age with the rejuvenation system has... plenty of disturbing implications itself, but it *would* improve scientific output without recourse to authoritarianism.  I have mentioned that in the way I've treated this now.  I'm mentioning it now, mostly because I'm wondering...  Maybe when I'm organizing this information into a book, I should use a facing pages system.  On the left, I'll place commentary about the technology as described currently.  On the right, I'll place a preferred replacement.  I could use this to describe a rather different structure of competing ideologies, though I think the current structure has a lot of beauty and if I went that far a lot of my replacements would only be reskins.  Only a minority of things strike me as actively unfair... mostly in the Panarchy section, which frankly sells out the liberating potential in the technology of the reiprocal will.

2021-8-23;  I noticed a commonality among the cultural specialty techs.  They refer to empathy in various ways.  Yet culture is not actually protective of empathy, IRL.  Many people have gone very far in culture while dearly protecting their foundation in secret obedience to hatred.  Nationalist indoctrination is a superficial oddball in that nationalism spreads by hardcore abuses rather than by empathetic acknowledgment of the other... and I think it's a fair signifier of what goes wrong as cultural specialty techs spread.  The cultural specialists manipulate others 'for the better'... in modest doses, their work is real, but the different technologies are not equivalent despite mechanical identity.  I'm particularly concerned that the Panarchy Informalist tech tree would tend to develop very serious sociopathic tendencies, because its technologies provide so much *healing* for sociopaths.  Like automatic empathy prosthetics.  That heals the sociopath *kind of*, but it also makes them *really successful*.  I think the only fully anti-sociopathic tech tree is the Orbital Observers tree, which makes no empathy references and ironically develops sociopaths quite directly.  *It uses them up.*  The more you have that tech tree going, the more you convert sociopaths into other kinds of people.  Sociopathy is ultimately just a disease.  Sufficient biotechnology can cure it.  The Panarchy Informalists can cover for it, but the orbital observers can cure it.

2021-8-23;  The things that are marked as increasing utopia or public protection are likely to be folded into some kind of synergies system as I continue working on this.  I'm still doing my first pass, hah!

2021-8-30;  I've forgotten what the first tech in the Commonwealth Unifiers tech tree is named, which is obnoxious as I feel I've distilled a great analysis of it...  Hmf.  Also, I think I need to break down the 'Utopia' score into 'Boredom' and 'Talent Protection' scores.  Orbital Hospitals are 1/5 Boredom, which is actually bad; they're a screaming stress point.  Stasis Controllers are 5/5 Boredom, which is also bad; most people don't appreciate society moving that slowly.  3/5 Boredom is "eustress", which most people appreciate, while 4/5 Boredom is ordinary serenity...  Actually, come to think about it...  I could use an 'Always Wrong' scoring system, since these vary inversely.  Techs would be either Stressful (3-5) or Boring (3-5)... and since there's only three points of variance, I can make it Stressful (1-3) and Boring (1-3)...

2021-09-06;  I feel like my format has invited an error into this.  Perhaps instead of a singular bureaucrat waste analysis, I should include all sources of waste that occur to me?  While writing something elsewhere this... morning...  I realized that some of the bad social dynamics that start in American public schools may be contributing to entrenched hatreds in American adults.  That would be non-literal bureaucratic waste on the Creche Schools.

2021-09-08;  I'm not sure how I'll rework it exactly, but my current ratings system is not going to survive to the final product.  I may however wait until I've done all the basic profiles by this system to define a different one.

2021-09-09;  I'm eventually going to have to edit a lot of these for brevity.  Right now I'm still gathering material and performing first-pass analysis.  My intention is that eventually, every technology's commentary will fit on a two-page spread in a book...  I really like the Imperial Processions of the Arts.  I adore the idea of seven hundred year art exhibitions.  It shows off to me that the Imperials truly understand the love of immortality.

2021-09-11;  I'm introducing a new Rehabilitative classification for technologies that I think would tend to rehabilitate people who might otherwise be useless to society.  We'll see how many of the techs in each ideology qualify...

2021-09-13;  I *really* need to do something about the poorly defined 'utopia' measure.  I'm going to rewrite all of this by the time I'm setting it for a book, but...  I don't know how to interpret that measure.  It isn't contributing something stably useful to my thoughts.  I need to break it down somehow to know how it can contribute to my future final writeup.  The protection rating already can replace part of the original function of the utopia rating.  Maybe I need to use liberation and protection ratings to represent the most famed tradeoff in politics.

2021-09-13;  New "me-points" scale.  3 me-points means "this lowers my active hostility to reproduction."  2 me-points means "I think this develops the talents of people similar to myself."  1 me-points means "I really like this."  0 me-points means "I don't see this as especially wonderful, but I could enjoy the company of people who like it."  -1 me-points means "I am actively opposed to the development of this."

2021-09-18;  I have an anti-financialism bias that's impacting my ability to perform these analyses.  Computerized Markets, for instance, are pretty much obviously false.  So are eternal bank branches.  Financial markets are about liquidity, not stability.

2021-09-18;  I want to invent a happier Panarchy.  Since the Panarchic Symposium resonates so strongly with me, I want to put a +Happiness tech in that slot.  What would do it, though?  Surely not 'Emulated Nanoinfluence', but nothing else has particularly occurred to me so far.  Maybe something in the vein of social progress acknowledgment and rational risk acceptance, as conservative fears of societal breakdown have been useless to society in advanced nations IRL.  I'm thinking about how something I got right in childhood was my lack of fear of miniscule risks.  When crime is negligible, as this game describes it to be in advanced societies, people shouldn't have their will cracked by fearing it.  If I can think of the right way to phrase it, that may be good for a +Happiness technology.

2021-09-19;  I'm thinking about the Symbiotic Ecosystem writeup that I'll do eventually.  It's difficult.  I haven't fully sorted through my thoughts on that one.  I think it's a Commonwealth<->Imperial converter, because it's a point where the ideologies of the two civilizations harmonize, and I think the generalist technologies function with less pressure on what kinds of jobs the people should be working.  I also see it as one of the Animal Uplift technologies that broadens the biotechnological capabilities of society, including both medicine and morphological freedom.  Yet it's also got this trace of sleaze to it in my thoughts, like it could be interpreted as a hypersmooth neoprimitivist 'technology' referring to the way a lot of humanity's really kind of awful primitive communities were more harmonious with nature than modern societies...  maybe that's valid?  I can't decide whether that creates two fully competing interpretations, or if it's a comfortable side effect of having a society that loves and feels safe in natural environments.

2021-09-19;  I could try to make an estimated partisanism of the different technologies.  I don't think I need that for the first pass.

2021-09-20;  I've realized that I greatly enjoy imagining Imperial priests.

2021-09-21;  I can tell that there's going to be a major bias in my proposed alternative tech tree for the galaxy.  In essence:  I no longer see the financial economy as 'real'.  Contrary to my childhood admiration of finance, I now consider it an oddity where meaningless tokens are exchanged at inflated valuations, and thus a kind of hollowing out of the economy to replace it with game pieces.  In the world of my prior lifetime, that process would have been fine; we spent decades in childhood learning games of finance and social organization, and so carried through our lives the willingness to play with meaningless tokens exchanged at inflated valuations.  It was something we did for social purposes.  We were not supremacist.  Nobody killed themselves over fluctuations in the values of their tokens, nor starved for a shortage of them.  Humans are not *like* that, and have trouble understanding or tolerating that, in which psychological environment finance seems to me like a barbarous falsehood.  The finance technologies of The Viceroy constantly talk about manipulating the market for stability, yet finance is all about liquidity and fluctuation, not stability.  Each of those technologies is contradictory and false.

2021-09-21;  I haven't done the write-up for Genetic Specialization yet, but one of the reasons that I like it is because it's the cure for the challenge of genetic stupidity.  People think 'harmless dumb' when they think about what stupidity is, but consider that the brutal torturers of the medieval consensus were pretty much sasquatches compared to modern people, as were the crazed lead-drinking implementers of the pedofascist Roman era.  The ability to medically treat genetic stupidity is part of the power of the Orbital Surveyors to eliminate 'demons' in society so that compassion rules, and that's part of why Genetic Specialization leads into two different +Happiness technologies.  The people who would laugh at the suffering of others... are *stupid*.  The people who are so broken and so submissive to their own collapse that they would pretend to gain pleasure from hurting others are the very Sasquatches who used to rule humanity.  They're doing a stupid thing for a stupid reason rooted in deficits that are presently incurable by medicine, but which may eventually be curable.  This ubiquitous stupidity of sadistic people that humanity itself suffers is something that destroys the trust that society needs to develop advanced technology... and when you start curing it, you get a society that treats people better, leading to less misery and more happiness.

2021-10-4;  The Unifiers are NOT Islamic.  I think they are restrictive, but not Islamic.  Why:  The Seat of Beauty is in their tech tree.  It breaks restrictive religions.  Meanwhile, the Natalist/Nationalist techs are down in the Commonwealth Consensus tree that also has Enlightened Policing.  That's where the miseries of the Islamic world reside, with their restrictive religion that their own societies are painfully disinterested in reforming.  Islam is a Commonwealth Consensus thing: like a corruption introduced on the Commonwealth by the Panarchy.

2021-10-11;  A little birdy told me to interpret the game as being "nations" (districts), "continents" (planets), and "planets" (systems).  (2021-11-2; Actually, a voice in my head.  Bleeeh!)

2021-11-2;  Maybe I should modify these to have a "reserve funding fraction" which represents the degree to which I think the bureaucratic waste is being funneled into reserve funding for a new government, vs the degree to which I think that potential income is being wasted or destroyed.

2021-11-6;  I'm adding a new rating called "Siphon Quality" which measures the reserve funding extraction rate implied by the technology.  Some of them are lossier than others, which could be corruption, wastage, or ongoing expenses.  A siphon quality analysis might replace the bureaucratic waste analysis eventually.

The Much-Reviled Lower Classes

The same ideology at different levels may substantially change its moral valence and the implications about how a society is governed.  Thinking about the six factions and how they change their constituent population demographics strikes me as salient here.  If I remember correctly (I'm not presently loading the game to check), Wealth 6 is described as 'galactic average', and at Wealth 6, the population is 2/5ths upper class, 2/5ths middle class, and 1/5th lower class.

Each faction is defined by a specific 'ascension' pattern.  For instance, the Panarchy Ritualists turn Commonwealth citizens into Imperial citizens, then they turn Imperial citizens into Panarchists.  This is the inverse of the Commonwealth Unifiers, who turn Panarchists into Imperial citizens, and then into Commonwealth citizens.  As Wealth increases, the ascension pattern moves.  (Also, population growth increases, which is *bogus*; primitive impoverished societies should have exuberant population growth bonuses checked by very low carrying capacities, so that they are constantly overcrowded, whereas advanced and wealthy societies should have increasing carrying capacities yet impaired population growth, such that they tend to undercrowd and benefit from efforts to increase their populations.)

When you pick up a territory, it has mostly collapsed, and it is mostly comprised of the failures of another faction.  In The Viceroy, you are *always* taking over the failed territories of your enemies, and you're always fighting a rebellion from your lower class.  (You are *also* always governing on *behalf of* that rebellion; canonically, you always close out assignments by giving the redeveloped territory *back*!  (This is why I like not killing rebels!!))  At the start of each assignment, the population is 4-5ths lower class, and at that level it may or may not be able to manage a decent modern sewage system, let alone a galactic society.

Since the *violent* conflicts between the factions are focused on the lower classes, each faction presumably most hates the lower classes of their opposing faction most.  So the Commonwealth Unifiers loathe the Panarchy because of what the Panarchic lower class is like, and the Panarchic Ritualists loathe the Commonwealth because of what the Commonwealth lower class is like.

The game doesn't give us too much hatred from which to demonize the lower classes, and I'm glad of that; The Viceroy has a gentle touch in some of the ways that matter.  Still, perhaps we get some clue about what the lower classes of the Commonwealth are like when the Panarchic Ritualists decry the 'authoritarianism' of the Commonwealth.  Look at the Commonwealth Unifier tech tree (upper right), and then imagine that ideology if it were being espoused by people who thought the best two techs on the tree were Reproductive Mandate and Nationalist Indoctrination.  I think that's what the Panarchy Ritualists rankle against: the worst people in the Commonwealth, the ruiners of the Commonwealth territories, are sexually-obsessed singers of praise to dear leader who think that people should be literally punished if they don't have enough sex.  If a territory became absolutely packed by people who thought like that, it would surely fall into internecine warfare across internal fracture points, because across a whole bunch of different proud supremacist groups, nobody would have any *lebensraum*.

What would the other examples be like?  If I can come up with at least one more, I'll reorganize this information into a section analogous to the Six Subcultures section for describing the Three Lower Classes.

The Much-Reviled Upper Classes

Contrasting the reviled lower classes, it's worth noting that the territories dominated by the *upper classes* tend to be wildly wasteful and ungovernable, which suggests that the upper classes are more pleasant and technophilic yet not really more productive than the lower classes.  Then, the middle class of each faction should be its general locus of virtue; in the Commonwealth Unifiers and the Panarchic Ritualists alike, the Imperials are unusually virtuous people!  Whereas in the territories governed by the Commonwealth Consensus and the Old Empire, you have unusually virtuous Panarchists, and in the territories of the Panarchic Informalists and the Imperial Reformers, you would get unusually virtuous admirers of the Commonwealth.
* The classes:
	* The Imperial Upper Class
		* AI.  They're AI.  Very powerful specialist machines.  Industrially powerful and indeed highly capable wherever they assert themselves, they're a little opaque and hard to communicate with.  'Bureaucratic Waste' in this population represents priority drift and some amount of resentment at being lead by what are increasingly likely to be inferior minds.  Although they remain engaged with physical reality (unlike the Panarchic upper class), these self-evolving machines are also prone to developing insular prioritizations that are difficult to understand and engage with.
		* As industrial machines, they may start tuning stars, filling the Oort clouds of systems with thinking observers, or other impressive but societally unusable projects.
		* As biological processors, sapient swarms of nanotech constructs may prefer to dismantle agricultural infrastructure and create new galactic wildernesses for others to colonize rather than continuing to produce vast exports.  Vast swathes of world get turned into "perfect" biome after "perfect" biome, according to the biological optimization parameters of specialist machines which love everything about plants, animals, and biochemistry, but whose benevolence to other forms of sapient life has become coincidental.  Worlds approaching this state are often watched over and directed in their re-evolution by fleets of biological spaceships whose technical briliance is masked by their disinterest in conventional society.
		* As cultural specialists, they may get too esoteric to hold the interest of cultural export markets, and the Empire's relatively unimpressive cultural development may lead them towards disloyal interests in the Panarchy or Commonwealth.
		* As bureaucratic waste develops, it gets harder and harder to tell them what to do.  Their machine-consciousnesses shrink to a remarkable degree at high populations, too.  Their "fully developed" territories ironically revert to an undeveloped state as total land reconversion sets in, now full of corrosive plagues that future Imperial administrations just burn up as a kind of fuel.  They also tend to be surrounded by distant orbital platforms that the Imperials gladly reuse, reconnecting with prior generations as they do.
		* Compliant upper class Imperials are often reincorporated into future settlement projects as Imperial technologies are redeveloped.  Noncompliant upper class Imperials are periodically cleared out by reconquest fleets, which may come from any of the three factions (even the Empire itself).  Shattered remnants from successful reconquests are redirected to novel terraforming and planetary construction projects in marginal and sub-marginal systems.
	* The Panarchic Upper Class
		* AI again.  Kind of.  Relatively more like ordinary sapiences than the Imperial AI, the Panarchic AI Collectives reach a kind of upload apotheosis... that makes the physical economy irrelevant to them, again promoting insular prioritization and concomitant underachieving.
		* At extremes of development, the Panarchy ceases to use physical goods and becomes unmoored from the natural economy.  A kind of madness or surreality sets in to their societies as they float untethered through a purely cognitive ecosystem.  Subjective eons without the use of physical goods causes a kind of decay in the external quality of their cultural markets, which become obsessed with untranslateable virtual luxuries.
		* As bureaucratic waste mounts, it becomes difficult to get Panarchists to stop playing games with each other and thinking infinitely deep (but basically irrelevant) "cultural" thoughts recursively contemplating one another's works.  They no longer produce recognizable outputs and can no longer fund government works.  End-stage Panarchic societies are very efficient and very small; they eat sunlight and live in shells or seas of computronium.
		* Eventually, these societies have no reason to remain on-world, blocking up expensive real estate that others could use, and their extremely compact habitats make emigrations highly cost-effective.  They often get bought off by the other galactic societies, including by Panarchist redevelopers who haven't quite achieved this level of development yet.  They leave behind worlds full of bizarre relics to be reclaimed by new settlers.
		* Some systems have ancient Panarchist orbitals in close orbit of their stars, contributing very little to the official population or economy of the system unless or until it develops in a similar fashion.  Other end-stage Panarchist populations move away to stars that lack colonizable planets, which are thus *only* usable to ex-embodied Panarchists.
	* The Commonwealth Upper Class
		* The only ones who cling to biological existence indefinitely, *most* of the upper class Commonwealth remain biological entities.  They live in recognizable ecumenopoli and have a tremendous prominence on the galactic stage for their beautiful city-scapes.
		* My thoughts on the Commonwealth upper class aren't fully defined yet.

2021-5-20;  Notably, in *this* game, unlike any society IRL, the "upper classes" appear to be the people who have insane numbers of kids and very little interest in doing anything except reproducing.  So it's like they're animals being empowered by automated systems - different variations of post-sapient homo fecundus, having given up meaning in life in favor of nihilistic reproductionism.  Suggesting that they're easily destroyed by the lower and middle classes of other factions, who will have unusually strong inclinations to do exactly that, while the middle and lower classes of their own faction will be unusually inclined to stand back and let their overpopulated "upper class" get scorched off...  If there's a few members of the upper class, their upper classness is more likely credible.  So that's at what, 5 Wealth?  6 Wealth?  More than that and the "upper class" stops looking much like a recognizable upper class given the way this game models population dynamics.  And, given that *I* treat stable immortals as people who are disinterested in reproduction, the Wealth multiplier on Influence suggests that these people are the very worst parents in the game, and they all tend to make reproduction look *awful*, so that the smarter people born into these societies are frequently socialized in a way that makes them suitable for the (more sustainable) galactic society that doesn't just breed constantly like homo fecundus.

2021-5-20;  Since I'm very unsure about my thoughts on this, I'm going to switch to a dated version of these posts going forward.  This game gets kind of maximally weird at high Wealth.  I think it'd be a more appealing vision if it had a more complex algorithm for Wealth's effect on population, representing that increasingly wealthy populations can sustain larger populations (multiplying carrying capacity), but are increasingly averse to doing so (multiplying crowding sensitivity), such that Wealth should increase population slowly rather than starkly, then eventually start to reduce it again when crowding oversensitization becomes the predominant impact.  This would make the technologies that increase crowding limits relatively more important, which I think would be appropriate; if you want to make a very Wealthy population reproduce, give them some celestial mansions in orbit.  On Earth, we see wildly overcrowded conditions where people are constantly having kids existing where people are most IMPOVERISHED, suggesting that low Wealth should increase population growth but narrow carrying capacities, so that the result is a miserably crowded society which actually gets more space to breathe as it gets Wealthier.

2021-5-20;  If I think about this long enough, I'm going to start producing predictive modeling algorithms for how I think it should work.  My mind has glanced off speculative population modeling algorithms a few times as I've played this game, and even though such algorithms are uniformly constructed in disagreement with the simple, disturbing algorithm in The Viceroy, thinking about them has been a reward of playing.  If I keep refining my strategies in game slowly over a long period of time, maybe I'll come up with something more clever than the game itself.

2021-6-22;  The Empire has an argument for why the rapesplosion isn't really a rapesplosive nightmare: they proliferate superstructures everywhere to make high-density living still give people plenty of elbow room.  The Panarchy also has an argument for why the rapesplosion isn't a nightmare: at extreme Wealth they proliferate super-efficient virtual environments and productive mechanical constructs, the first of which is super-luxurious even at extreme density, and the second of which is a population needing few if any luxuries.  Only the Commonwealth has no argument for why the rapesplosion at high Wealth isn't a nightmare; their tech tree builds neither massive accommodations nor extreme cognitive technologies, suggesting that at extreme "Wealth" they're all stuck living in cramped apartments raising their mandatory children in the hive of Compulsory Happiness under the watchful gaze of their omniscient surveillance systems.  Right now, that means ending Commonwealth looks *worst*.  If I could instead *fix* the rapesplosion at high Wealth, ending Commonwealth would start to make a lot of sense, because a more conventionally Wealthy population prizing large amounts of free space and empowerment of a small-to-moderate population would be great.  In *that* narrative, the Commonwealth's ambitions of culture, leisure, and safety start to actually look like a utopia.

2021-8-21;  Something I just realized that The Viceroy gets right about the technological progressions is that every subculture embraces the technology of every other subculture... at its own level.  The Panarchic Ritualists don't spurn the Commonwealth.  They just consider police to be kind of... dubious, and something that society had best keep a close eye on rather than let itself be lead by.  In other words, the Panarchic Ritualists put the police *among the lower class*.  Good police forces are not held as a crowning achievement of society, but as a regrettable necessity that one should like to minimize.  Note that the Panarchic Ritualists pride themselves on being *anti-authoritarian*, and this makes a lot of sense of the way that they use Commonwealth technologies.  They install strong civilian oversight to the militant technological potential of the Commonwealth.  Intrepreting the classes as how each subculture views the relative prestige of each kind of work may be insightful going forward.  Trying to think of how a lower class palace would work for the Commonwealth is kind of peculiar...  but perhaps it means that the Commonwealth considers Panarchic government simulations to be an extremely expensive class of entertainment that is just barely suitable for entertaining the kind of peons who think society needs to read crash reports to figure out what went wrong after disasters.

2021-8-23;  One of the things that really bothers me about this game is that the upper classes are implied to have the most sex, while the lower classes are implied to have the least sex.  The violation of this pattern is one of the reasons why I like the Empire more than the others; the Orbital Observers and Old Empire tech tree both suggest that they have means of nonsexual reproduction.  AFAIK this pattern of the upper classes having the most sex has not been achieved on Earth since the Bronze age, and actually one of the menaces of humanity is that the generally destructive lower classes have the greatest sexual fixations by far.  I've written about this before as "Bubba Joe Dysgenics" (though maybe not in this archive).  So I think one of the secrets in The Viceroy *may* be that it reversed the ordinality of the upper and lower classes, and put the most "Bubba Joe" version of each ideology in the upper class...  see also my horror at the overcrowded rapesplosion unleashed by achieving pinnacle "Wealth" in-game.  I would still like to fix the Wealth model in this game to represent that increasingly wealthy populations can *theoretically* support more people, but *have increasing intolerance for crowding* such that very wealthy populations tend to ebb if policy does not support dense urbanization.

2021-09-13;  I think I really like the idea of an Imperial upper class, conceptually.  I called the upper classes the Bubba Joe classes in the last post, but they're both the most numerous version AND the most radically productive class, right?  That doesn't fit with Bubba Joe.  I should perhaps think of them as being the class most likely to include virtual representatives: people who only exist in super-advanced computer systems and/or whose external appearance is literally a networked swarm.  And the game specifies that the majority of lifeforms are Ascetics, suggesting that the upper classes are the most Ascetic on average.  Ascetic Commonwealth bothers me *most*, because I imagine a strictly limited society that is absolutely dedicated to remaining biological in function, yet which has been taken over by the kind of ass-cetic humans who have a ton of kids *and* a ton of "discipline".  (Imagining them as Bubba Joes helps soften the "discipline" issue, but still results in imagining *questionable* parenting.)  Ascetic Panarchy sounds pretty cool, because I imagine that an 'ascetic' Panarchist who has given up on dominating others will absolutely soak in cheap virtual luxuries... but at the same time I feel like the Panarchy in this game is presented as not caring about Happiness enough to really enjoy its own potential, and they're presented as manipulative enough that ever-growing numbers suggest a different kind of questionable parenting.  Ascetic Imperial sounds *best*, because they're the robots.  They're capable of both physical and virtual luxury within the bounds of what can be fairly termed 'ascetic', their concept of serenity is presented as still including valuing happiness, and a massive growing class of general robots sounds like exactly something a super-advanced society would start building to maintain its wonders.  I don't have to imagine Bubba Joes, tyrant ascetics, *or* manipulative sots... just a growing society of cyborgs and robots who gradually outmode their creators while inheriting a wonderful harmonious society of people who don't fight to dominate each other.

2021-09-25;  Based on my thought about the middle class being unusually virtuous, I think they may be the most conventionally 'sci-fi' of the three social classes in the game.  So the lower classes are Earth-level and near-future versions of each ideology, the middle classes are the Galactic Ascent versions of each ideology, while the upper classes are the rarefied and strange versions of each ideology.  The subcultures that 'end in the same place' may not be all that similar to each other in practice, given that the game mentions in its second level crowding tier (5-10) that such crowding is the norm across the galaxy.  That would correspond to heavy middle class development, meaning that the Imperial Reformers and the Old Empire (for example) have "Galactic Ascent" cultures of Commonwealth and Panarchy respectively.

2021-09-25;  Thinking of progression...  Perhaps each subculture is Ashamed of its lower class, Enthusiastic about its middle class, and Seduced by its upper class.  This includes within the class.  So for instance, the Commonwealth Unifiers have a Panarchic lower class, and if a Panarchist identifies with the Commonwealth Unifiers, they are still aligned to and in some sense enthusiastic for Panarchic technologies, but they are keenly aware of the shames and shortcomings of the Panarchy.  This could help explain why each collapsed region is picked up by the faction who *least* typifies its fallen population: each collapsed region has a window in which they have recently been confronted with serious deficits and shortcomings in their prior ideology, and so there is a moment in history wherein shame becomes a catalyst for change.

2021-09-25;  Based on the ideological structure suggested by their technologies, the total lack of +Happiness techs in their basic structure, and what I noticed about how Panarchic Informalist technology strikes me as 'curing' many deficits, yet applying such cures only while people are directly under its influence, I suspect that of the three upper classes, the Panarchic upper class has the highest rate of (what we we would consider) mental illness.  The Imperial upper class has 'no' mental illness, but due to cognitive divergence their sanity is only moderate for the purpose of this ranking.  The Commonwealth upper class, with its many +Happiness techs and Biological-processing advantage, would have the highest sanity rate.  I think this ranking does the Panarchy a conceptual injustice.  That suggests uncured deficits in the basic justice of the setting, which is one of the things that motivates me to want to build an alternative tech tree.
