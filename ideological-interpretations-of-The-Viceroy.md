# Ideological Interpretations of The Viceroy

Presented in the game's lore are the six subcultural ideologies, the three overarching ideologies, and the implicit subdivisions in the technology graph.  Thoughts on the social dynamics implied by the choices and the collections of the choices seem like one of the core aspects going on in the narratives that are told within the game by the game's mechanics.

The Six Subcultures
 - The Old Empire -
	 - The Basic
		 - The humans most like Beyonders summoned the Beyonders most like humans, creating the Empire of the Elect.  This fraction of the Old Empire is serene because they know that the time cost of each action is illusory.  They're happy to jaunt around *being* the fungible population, doing esoteric tasks for the amusement of distant strangers on other worlds, trusting that enough will get done fast enough if people just keep working without worrying about it.
	 - The Value of Immortality
		 - Velocity is only a matter of perspective; slow and steady work may even get the work done faster.  Immortality does these people a great service.
	 - The View on Collapse
		 - The Old Empire holds the burning world in its hands.  That's an important symbol for them.  Yes, galactic society is always collapsing, and yes that means the empire is always collapsing.  The old empire is aware that they are infinitely declining forever.  They call that acknowledging entropy, and they only worry about it day to day to the extent that doing so is part of their dayjob.
	 - The Rebellion (Commonwealth)

 - The Reformed Empire -
		 - The Basic
			 - Serenity in motion, and an occasionally vile sense of humor.  An active opposition to anything that doesn't seem like a productive endeavor, combined with a will to prey on labor opportunities, off-load their challenges, exaggerate their accomplishments, and look for opportunities to coast.  Are they productive on average?  Somehow, yes.
		 - The Value of Immortality
			 - Well, they're happy to be alive.  They're not always good for everyone else's happiness, but they are themselves happy in all kinds of conditions.  They can be lured into a lot of ugly work while only moderately overpaying them, and if the blast radius is small enough...  Ugh...  Immortality does these people a great service.
		 - The View on Collapse
			 - The Reformed Empire is on fire, and it can't tell the difference between going down and going faster.  If the Empire falls, it needed to fall.  If something new rises after, great!  If the Empire itself rises after, great!  If the Empire somehow doesn't even fall?  Great!  As long as the Empire keeps MOVING and DOING STUFF, the Empire is Great!
		 - The Rebellion (Panarchic)
 
 - The Monocultural Commonwealth - 
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 - The Rebellion (Panarchic)

 - The Commonwealth Democracy - 
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 - The Rebellion (Imperial)

 - The Panarchic Purist-Preservationists - 
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 - The Rebellion (Commonwealth)

 - The Panarchic AI Collective -
	 - The Basic
	 - The Value of Immortality
	 - The View on Collapse
	 - The Rebellion (Imperial)

Of Specific Technologies

I imagine that every node on the technology tree represents a lot of technologies which are in some way linked developments conceptually.  Implementing a technology affirms those potentials and builds them into a location, but they exist everywhere that society has sufficiently developed.  As such, every technology in the game can be interpreted as a postulate about how people should prefer to develop society in an environment of difficult immortality.

Specific decisions about what to cure vs what to leave as-is can also be interpreted as ideological commitments; this is something of a note-to-self that I need to work on filling out my [[challenge-cures]] page for my own reference.

1.  Distributed Thought
    1.  If you trust that intelligence is well-distributed in the population, you're occasionally wrong (horrific consequences), but you're usually just letting people work without undue stress (technical aptitude increases).  This matches the Old Empire's concept of achieving serenity through fungibility.  If everybody does some of the thinking, nobody has to do all of the thinking.
    2.  The described technology sounds like some kind of hive-mind attempting on-demand cognitive load balancing for all integrated individuals.  That would accomplish this objective.  Maybe this is why so many Imperials have cat-ear antennae implants.
    3.  The 'hyperspace link' in this case might also be interpreted as some kind of stupidity-preserving social policy basket which although unintuitive can be mathematically proven to yield improved scientific performance by getting more people doing the most interesting work.  In this case, distributed thought would increase average scientific yield and reduce society's reliance on especially brilliant individuals, which (per the values of the Old Empire) would be good for reducing the amount of stress that the brilliant people suffer.
    4.  The 'hyperspace link' could also refer to an inclination to try to establish rational trust with outsiders.  In-setting, this could be an FTL knowledge-sharing link-up implemented across the Empire, such as the one that is in-universe mediated by the Library Relay.  It could even be "this planet has been equipped so that the general public can use the Imperial Library Relay network the way it was originally designed to be used".
    5.  I believe the correct understanding is, "All simultaneous understandings are valid to the extent that they can be held in a noncontradictory fashion."  All of this sounds like stuff the Old Empire might try.
    6.  The bureaucratic wastage here has two components.  The literal component which arises in the utopic phase and persists throughout is that society has to hire more social scientists, more fact checkers, and more neurologists than it would otherwise require.  The metaphorical component arises from the mental homogenization and promotion of questionable intelligence that this society engages in, which may prevent the rise of effective bureaucrats in societies which have begun to develop the hatred of bureaucracy.
2.  Telepathic Dust
	1.  As described, telepathic dust involves setting up the infrastructure to manufacture and distribute temporary clouds of empathy-dust across the public.  It sets up ad-hoc transmissions between people in the area of effect so that they can feel each others' emotions and get a transient sense of one anothers' thoughts.  It's a kind of super-tech toy for enhancing other kinds of play and encouraging people to trust each other.
	2.  This technology is so literally described, that the wonder isn't so much how it works, but how it breaks.  As telepathic dust proliferates in society, more of its social spaces would be afflicted by a haze of nanites in which empathy deficits temporarily evaporate.  Are people who are only empathetic due to telepathic dust actually empathetic at all?  Well...  no, they aren't.  The sense of trustworthiness created by the dust is only locally rational.
	3.  Ideologically, I think the Panarchy Informalists need telepathic dust in order to create empathetic AI.  You can implement a self-aware economy without telepathic dust, but then the AI really won't know what people want, making it much more likely to be a paperclipper.  AIs in this setting are empathetic due to telepathic dust, but because the Panarchy Informalists bind the first three technologies in their tree into an unbreakable trio, the Panarchy Informalist's AIs can **ALL** be empathetic.
	4.  I consider this the tip of the 'empathy maximizer AI' sub-branch of the panarchy informalist tech tree.  These aren't unempathetic machines, they're dangerously empathetic machines.  In my own fiction of the setting, these ones will very empathetically convert planets into computronium that thinks about how to be more empathetic.  This is THE computronium gate, a thought itself of thinking.  The more of the upper left technologies that a district implements, the more I imagine it collapsing into an ocean of thinking nanites.
	5.  This is also the founder of the mind control trio in The Viceroy.  Mental Transcription, Telepathic Dust, and Subconscious Education all directly interface with and overwrite the recipients' mind with new information.  This is a dangerous general accelerant.  The value of instruction scales dramatically with the quality of instruction.  I believe in machine-assisted free will, but I also believe that making sure machine adjustments actually reflect what the individual wants will be a serious struggle IRL.
	6.  If they can share feelings between people, who could ever attack a bearer of telepathic dust?  Who would still fight and die, if fighting and dying could only feel good if both participants were enjoying it?  This is probably another reason why the Panarchic Informalists consider telepathic dust a key basis of their ideology; making sure every Informalist administration has access to supplies of telepathic dust strongly reinforces the immortality of their emissaries.
	7.  I consider this to be one of the 'animal uplift' technologies, with the way it re-engineers minds.  Telepathic dust lowers the emotional processing differences that arise between very different people by creating a temporary local harmony in its area of effect.  This would be helpful for overcoming communication barriers between people of different species.
	8.  The bureaucratic wastage from this technology arises from three factors.  Firstly, it's a toy.  People will spend more time playing with each other as it gets more abundant.  Secondly, it's good for reinforcing understanding between people, which is mostly a good empathetic function, yet may also strengthen conspiratorial social organizations which rely on unspoken "understandings".  Thirdly, manufacturing and distributing a product also literally requires the organizations which manufacture and distribute it, thus directly requiring the dedication of people and funds in an ongoing way.
3.  Panarchialization Policy
	1.  Presenting panarchism as being up-front about the search for MEANING IN CONTRADICTION sounds kind of mean at first, but it also sounds better than the stuffy search for unity around some set of ideals that will only be defined by specialists in ivory towers.  Panarchialization supports the prosperity of society very broadly by acknowledging great sweeps of government projects that are all worth prosperity to *someone*.
	2.  The experimental factor in panarchialization should not be missed.  Panarchic social experimentation is trying to aggregate and implement data about effective governing practices from across the galaxy.  That's why this technology leads into 'Panarchic Data Posts'.  Governments that are panarchializing are pulling on this data well and trying to add new experiments of their own to it.
	3.  I think this tech is actually really banal and it almost amounts to saying, "We're trying a lot of stuff, okay?  We're NOT sure how to rule."  There's some virtue in that!
	4.  Base culture development tries to resolve frictions in society by making people more harmonious and impressive to each other.  It counters (or is countered by) blandness and civil unrest.  Panarchists want to be cool, and they want the government to be cool.  That's why this tech leads into panarchic retreats.  When the government is trying to do cool stuff, that draws in tourists.
	5.  Although its base claim is that it increases cultural productivity, I've observed that this technology always lowers incomes when implemented.  However, it still increases Wealth, thus increasing population and science.  I interpret this as meaning that panarchialization increases frictional losses and inefficiencies in government due to an increase in wasted/duplicated/contradictory efforts, but it also accelerates the rate at which the government incorporates diverse individuals and trials new methods of organization.
	6.  This technology implicitly pits different teams of bureaucrats against each other.  Due to the pacifism of bureaucrats, it's unlikely that anyone will die of that, and the resulting bureaucratic wastage is mostly literal.  This might be fun, and it might make bureaucrats look like more interesting/competent people, yet the inevitability of wasted effort and the rise of unnecessary arbitrary polarization might also be fairly rated to have dystopic potential.
4.  Frictionless Highways
	1.  This isn't a technology at all.  This is a person who exists at many levels of technology.  Their great interest in attaining high velocities makes them fun, while their calm control of fast-moving systems makes them competent in many roles.  Furthermore, access to consumer goods is strongly motivating to them, especially goods related to their interests.
	2.  This is a technology in the sense of being a possible governing practice: specifically the practice of reaching out to and including this kind of person in society.
	3.  The competency of this technology varies starkly based on the development of the market in a territory.  In a planned economy, these people tend to be louts whose road and vehicle demands are unnecessarily expensive in all but the most specialized and well-developed districts.  In a market economy, the same demands motivate much higher levels of productivity out of this population, as they're motivated by and will work to support their access to vehicles.
	4.  If they're operating at some level in a feudal society, these people are heroic.  Their excitement for economic acceleration matures into an antilocalist interest in the broader economy.  They don't necessarily have to be lords, either; they don't get cheaper than the vehicles that they demand, but as society gets wealthier they also don't get *more expensive*.  Eventually the peasants *can* have fast cars, and at that point the fast-moving advocates of an integrated trade economy fend off stagnation in stratified markets.  Note however that the rebellion-promoting factors of feudal economies magnify the dystopic potential of this technology.
	5.  If these people are part of society, its Wealth level manifests more distinctively in the development of that society's vehicles.
	6.  The bureaucratic waste from this technology is predominantly literal, but not entirely literal.  It is most literal in planned economies and least literal in feudal economies.  The inclusion of people who love attaining calm control of fast-moving systems is no more (but no less) bureaucratically expensive than maintaining good roadways and vehicle fabrication organizations.  Should a society engaging in this practice grow extremely unfit for bureaucratic life, these individuals may take up the hatred of bureaucracy, which intrinsically operates at a different pace than they would prefer.  Furthermore, investing excessively in roads and vehicles is potentially injurious to public health due to pollution and vehicular accident risks, which may damage the productivity of skilled bureaucrats as well as injuring the assurance of safety that they prefer.

2021-3-31; I feel generally scared and/or angry at trying to ideologically analyze the Imperial technologies, which strike me as rotten with unspoken dependencies and/or outright lies, even though I can see that there's also some measure of brilliance and worth down there if I'd a greater mastery of the game to use it with.

2021-4-20; I'm feeling better about these, although I still don't feel competent with them.  I still get the sense that the more you develop the technology of the setting, the more *literal* Imperial technologies get...  Frictionless Highways exemplify this sense, as that looks to me like it refers not to its literally described technology so much as to a kind of person who thrives at many possible technology levels while contributing to the serene industrialism of the Empire in any of them.  In a low-tech society, this guy loves racehorses...  Maybe this guy still loves racehorses when he's got cat-ear antennae in a cyberized society, too.

The Much-Reviled Lower Classes

The same ideology at different levels may substantially change its moral valence and the implications about how a society is governed.  Thinking about the six factions and how they change their constituent population demographics strikes me as salient here.  If I remember correctly (I'm not presently loading the game to check), Wealth 6 is described as 'galactic average', and at Wealth 6, the population is 2/5ths upper class, 2/5ths middle class, and 1/5th lower class.

Each faction is defined by a specific 'ascension' pattern.  For instance, the Panarchy Ritualists turn Commonwealth citizens into Imperial citizens, then they turn Imperial citizens into Panarchists.  This is the inverse of the Commonwealth Unifiers, who turn Panarchists into Imperial citizens, and then into Commonwealth citizens.  As Wealth increases, the ascension pattern moves.  (Also, population growth increases, which is *bogus*; primitive impoverished societies should have exuberant population growth bonuses checked by very low carrying capacities, so that they are constantly overcrowded, whereas advanced and wealthy societies should have increasing carrying capacities yet impaired population growth, such that they tend to undercrowd and benefit from efforts to increase their populations.)

When you pick up a territory, it has mostly collapsed, and it is mostly comprised of the failures of another faction.  In The Viceroy, you are *always* taking over the failed territories of your enemies, and you're always fighting a rebellion from your lower class.  (You are *also* always governing on *behalf of* that rebellion; canonically, you always close out assignments by giving the redeveloped territory *back*!  (This is why I like not killing rebels!!))  At the start of each assignment, the population is 4-5ths lower class, and at that level it may or may not be able to manage a decent modern sewage system, let alone a galactic society.

Since the *violent* conflicts between the factions are focused on the lower classes, each faction presumably most hates the lower classes of their opposing faction most.  So the Commonwealth Unifiers loathe the Panarchy because of what the Panarchic lower class is like, and the Panarchic Ritualists loathe the Commonwealth because of what the Commonwealth lower class is like.

The game doesn't give us too much hatred from which to demonize the lower classes, and I'm glad of that; The Viceroy has a gentle touch in some of the ways that matter.  Still, we get some clue about what the lower classes of the Commonwealth are like when the Panarchic Ritualists decry the 'authoritarianism' of the Commonwealth.  Look at the Commonwealth Unifier tech tree (upper right), and then imagine that ideology if it were being espoused by people who thought the best two techs on the tree were Reproductive Mandate and Nationalist Indoctrination.  I think that's what the Panarchy Ritualists rankle against: the worst people in the Commonwealth, the ruiners and eaters of the Commonwealth territories, are sexually-obsessed singers of praise to dear leader who think that people should be literally punished if they don't have enough sex.

What would the other examples be like?  If I can come up with at least one more, I'll reorganize this information into a section analogous to the Six Subcultures section for describing the Three Lower Classes.

The Much-Reviled Upper Classes

Contrasting the reviled lower classes, it's worth noting that the territories dominated by the *upper classes* tend to be wildly wasteful and ungovernable, which suggests that the upper classes are more pleasant and technophilic yet not really more productive than the lower classes.  Then, the middle class of each faction should be its general locus of virtue; in the Commonwealth Unifiers and the Panarchic Ritualists alike, the Imperials are unusually virtuous people!  Whereas in the territories governed by the Commonwealth Consensus and the Old Empire, you have unusually virtuous Panarchists, and in the territories of the Panarchic Informalists and the Imperial Reformers, you would get unusually virtuous admirers of the Commonwealth.
