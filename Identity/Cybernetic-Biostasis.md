#Cybernetic-Biostasis

This card was conceived of in the process of writing [[2024-02-22-Seven-Hundred-and-Sixth]]].

This is the concept that death only happens when there is inadequate information to revive someone.  I don't really believe in cybernetic biostasis; I believe in consciousness continuity.  If you revive someone after death, you have a new person who shares extensive similarities with the person you had before.  Still, it's cool.

This agora project is basically a mindfile for me.  It documents a lot of the fluctuations in my thoughts over time, even useless days spent thinking inappropriate things about gryphons.
