# Pacifist

Pacifists oppose violence as a means of resolving disputes.  Some pacifists oppose violence even in defense of the self.  I am not that radically pacifistic myself, although I think I am gentle enough that I may as well be.  I don't think I'd really be prepared to defend myself.

I got attacked a lot growing up, but I was never a good fighter.  I was treated as a violent child, but I was never a willing participant in violence.
