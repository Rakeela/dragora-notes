#Southern-Wind-Nations

Much of this will be eventually redrafted.

I don't remember the proper names for any of the Southern Wind Nations, but they were theocracies where dragons lived in the open rather than as skulking shapeshifters.  The priests of the Wind Goddess ruled them.  Their priests were male and female alike, and in that sense advanced from the rest of the world.  The dragons of that region were, on average, much shinier than we were; their scales were finer and brighter, often with a metallic sheen.  This is why Kairn was a *gold* dragon.  It wasn't a metaphor, but a literalism of his body.
