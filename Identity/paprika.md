# paprika

Paprika has almost no flavor to me.  I struggle to characterize it as something other than a pigmented dust, and it serves as one of those little reminders that other people perceive the world differently than I do.

Since paprika has no flavor to me, it can't turn me away by its independent qualia, nor can it lure me in.  If I knew and liked someone who loved paprika an awful lot, it would be pretty easy for me to develop an associational fondness of paprika.  If I knew and disliked someone who loved paprika that much, it would be pretty easy for me to develop an associational dislike of paprika.  The fact that paprika has no flavor and no associations for me is a testament to the fact that I've never met someone who expressed strong opinions about it.

I've learned the flavor of paprika!  By eating very little for a few days, then mixing salt, paprika, and ginger, I made something that tastes deliciously unlike a mixture of salt and ginger alone.  Which, by the way, is delicious enough that I now want to eat something salty and gingery.  Maybe in a few weeks I'll try ordering fast food fries and gingering them.
