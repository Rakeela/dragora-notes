# Atheist

An atheist does not believe in any particular deity.  Agnostic is just a synonym.

I used to call myself agnostic, but I think agnostic is just "I'm atheist, but I don't want to fight," which sounds to me like how atheism ought to be anyways.  Atheism is a free-thinking ideal and active religious conflict is wrong for it.
