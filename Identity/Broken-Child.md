#Broken-Child

A broken child is one who was treated violently on enough occasions to have psychological scars from violence.  This is the phrase I use to think of my origin.  If I've ever seen it anywhere outside of my own thoughts, I no longer remember where I got it from.

Most broken children are violently unstable.  I'm not sure I count as unstable; I'm sure that I'm not violent.  I'm more of a traumatized lump.  I think the difference is that I never-EVER normalized violence to myself, but instead I read with deranged obsession to resist normalizing violence.  I give thanks to my genetic aptitude for speed-reading, for it seems a pacifist trait.
