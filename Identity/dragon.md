# Dragon

Rawr.  I am an [[otherkin]] dragon.  I am terribly unhappy with [[being human]].

I think I could write forever about dragons.  I haven't indulged too much so far.  I'm not sure how I should organize content related to this.

Draconity is not a spiritual affinity for me, it's a thwarted biological affinity.  I don't care about the symbol.  I care about the body.  I'm supposed to have earfins; little muscled spars on each side of my face with wrinkly flaps between them, that rise, fall, or turn with my attention.  I'm supposed to have a tail; a flexible muscled limb for communication.  I should have hindquarters capable of launching me into the air, and wings capable of catching me there... although I don't really mind the lack of wings as much as the lack of other things.  I should even have a muzzlehorn; I only had a muzzlehorn, but most dragons have horns, and I like those as well.  I even ought to have pheromones, and I don't mean anything so mind-controlling as humans portray them in fiction.  Your neighbors' land should bear their scent!

When I say this is biological, some of it is prurient.  Earfins are sexually sensitive in intimate contexts.  To the extent that human bodies react in scent, human noses can't detect it.  Human leg structure is wrong.  Humans have no horns.  I don't know how to be attracted to someone without a tail.  I am incredibly disappointed with human sexuality.  I don't even think humans are as beautiful to each other as dragons are to one another.

There's a society that I miss, as well.  There were two other sapient species in that world; humans (who usually hated us) and hill-raptors (who admired us and typically insisted that they were also dragons).  Yet more importantly, there were dragons.  We were the rightful rulers of the land.  Our territory maps - long since transferred to paper - were the best cartographic tools available.  We loved the land.  We had alliances and treaties between us as well; each of us was sovereign.  We even had neutral territories and common flyways, defined by ink and custom.  We invited one another deep into our territories to discuss personal matters, or we met on neutral ground to discuss larger events and trade treasures amongst one another.  Trade was a game played with tokens, too; we argued over the relative value of things, and traded representative assets more often than real assets.

It was galling that anyone should be able to exclude us from any part of the land.  Where humans arranged their affairs without challenging our territories, we did them no harm; where they accepted our governance, they lived safely in our lands.  (Safer in our lands than beyond them; we stopped their worst inclinations in land management.)  Yet they hunted us, and tried to force us into hiding while insisting on the right themselves to live openly.  It's true that we killed more of them than they killed of us, but that disparity vanishes when compared to reproductive rates; we didn't kill them in a way that impacted their population levels, but they killed us in a way that impacted ours.  Nor is it true that we would necessarily have killed *any* of them if we'd been safe from them.  It was fairly unheard of for any dragon to kill a hill-raptor, and it was fairly unheard of for any hill-raptor to reject the territorial claims of dragons or destroy the land beneath them.  The link should be obvious!  The hill-raptors worked with us in where to site their fortified towns, and we were comfortable having them as neighbors.  The humans ceaselessly pulled down forests and plated the land in famine, so we ended up in conflict with them.

Yes, famine.  Humans try to plate the land in farms and they really just plate it in famine.  The primitive societies where families have babies and babies and babies and babies and are constantly destroying nature to build farms end up wailing at god when the land dries up.  They ought to be wailing at the rampant reproducers in their society.  A dragon can eat like a village and still destroy the land less than a human population exponentiating in misery.  Why do humans breed MORE when they suffer?

I don't know what customs the hill-raptors used to keep their populations balanced, but we had no trouble with them.  Their population increased slowly over time and they weren't nearly as prone to plagues and famines.  They quarried out hills and drove mines into mountains instead of destroying forests.  We considered that pattern much more interesting and favorable, especially because individual hill-raptor communities tended to send emissaries throughout our territories giving modest gifts in celebration when they discovered rare stones and metal ores.  We could trade with them favorably, and there was no apparent conflict between their wealth and our wealth.

In hindsight, I no longer disagree with "the pretense of draconity" that the hill-raptors held to.  They were right; they were dragons.  The dragon community on Earth is more diverse than the dragon community that I lived with in that lifetime, and interacting with more unusual dragons has made me realize that the echoes of the perfect form are broadly recognizable.  I would now classify the hill-raptors of my former world as wingless raptor-dragons.

We did consider the hill-raptors somewhat unfavorably warlike, just as we did the humans.  Perhaps a bit moreso; the hill-raptors were individually better warriors than humans, and amply supplied with worked metal for weapons and armor.  Humans died to dragons more than dragons died to humans (though they also outbred us), but I think more humans died in human-raptor wars than ever died to dragons.  Although human-human wars were brutal on their population as well...  Dragons killed dragons far less than humans killed humans.  Humans considered us a demonic evil threat to humanity, but we only considered humans vicious nuisances who built interesting societies that we could profit from if we could survive in proximity to them.  There were even a few dragons who survived settling in human communities without concealment.  If we'd worked more closely with the hill-raptors instead, they probably would've wanted to use us militarily against human populations, and I think that was a sticking point in dragon-raptor relations.  *We* wanted to tend our lands and treasures in peace, not tear down castles as living siege weapons.  The threat of war was upsetting, even frightening; we preferred concealment and/or detente.  At least humans (in that society) weren't interested in weaponizing us.

Even in human fictions, the dragons that ruin towns must necessarily only be violent every few decades, or else there will be no towns to ruin.  Yet humans, like the hill-raptors of my prior world, can only see dragons as avatars of violence, despite that even in human fictions dragons spend the greater fraction of their longer lives in the pursuit of peaceful endeavors.  To a human, the capability of violence is synonymous with the actuation of violence, which is quite simply an abomination; that humans have not glassed the Earth with nuclear weapons is a testament to the falsehood of the equivocation of violent capability and violent actuation.

I'm considering posting a write-up about 'echoes of the perfect form'.  It's essentially how I think of attractiveness.  I can only rate humans on the normalized sapient hotness scale, and anything that I can rate on echoes of the perfect form tends to do better.  A 4 on the NSH scale is notionally better than a 3 on the EPF scale, which is what it means that the NSH scale is 'normalized'.  Yet what I can rate on EPF tends to come in 7+, whereas the NSH returns a lot of 2-4.

I used to call humans 'hot' if they returned a 4 on the NSH, but I don't do that anymore.  Humans aren't hot.  Sorry, humans.  4 is actually a *bad* score.
