# Concept Map

Copied from [[2020-11-23-third]]:
This concept map concept still seems spectacular.  I check the map at least twice as many times as I compose posts.  If I model the connections between my thoughts, can I accelerate my ability to flow between the concepts of them?

It may be useful to pursue [[concept-substructuring]] as a way to sort the information.  At the same time, it's interesting to see emergent-concept-substructuring appear due to clusters of related information.  This is the current payoff for including the very irrelevant Age of Wonders information, since it self-assembled into this interesting shape at the edge of the graph.
