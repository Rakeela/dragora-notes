07:59.  I got up at least an hour and seventeen minutes ago, according to my treadmill's timer.  I've been doing morning stuff.

8:25.  Was that another half hour?  It hardly felt like it.  I'm very calm, but not very focused.  I really adore Flight Rising, which is where I spent that time.

9:14.  I'm going to credit myself with 200 words edited, and whoops I just realized that I forgot to mark my starting word count.  I finished yesterday with 21,408.

9:15.  21,408.

9:17.  Another 68 words of editing.

9:18.  58 words of editing.

12:04.  23,719.  2,311 words of progress.  2,337 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.  0 words on the chapter.

13:38.  24,492.  768 on the chapter.  3,084 words of progress.  I am so tempted to stop here.  I am building up a sense of frustrating inadequacy as I write.  A better writer would do so much better with the scene that I'm on.  I feel like I should stop and recharge by reading books.

16:53.  I ate a huge amount of sweets.  I haven't been able to handle my fasting.  My candy vault discipline isn't working.

16:55.  The thought that fasting would be seen as virtuous is so intolerable to me that I can't handle fasting, but then when I eat I can't handle eating lightly.

16:57.  I can't cope with the way our society equivocates between weight and virtue.  If fat people were seen as morally equivalent to thin people, I would have an easier time losing weight.  I think moralizing about the abstention of food is actually evil, and then I can't handle the thought that I might be doing something like moralizing about the abstention of food.  Eating reassures me that I'm not evil.

22:57.  7.5 miles.  1,365 kcal.  27,584 steps.  6 hours, 17 minutes, and 1 second.  Average speed 1.2 mph.
