#2021-2-20-Thirty-Fourth

I'm in pain today, and having trouble getting started on any sensible endeavor.  "It's Saturday, so that's okay," is probably what my husband would say; sadly, my college puts most of its due dates on Sunday (IMO that should be Friday, Monday, or Wednesday) so I'm used to thinking of Saturdays and Sundays as working days.  I thought maybe I was just exhausted, so I drank an overstrength energy drink.  Now I feel considerably less exhausted, but not any less in pain!  Caffeine plus pain equals agitation.  So I'm writing this, because I can, and because doing so feels better than not.  It's a way to associate my way through my thoughts and bring something to order from them.

I've added [[Environmental News Archive]] to the dragora archive here.  I'm not sure about the naming of it.  I'm still uncommitted to this news archiving business.  Something about it doesn't grab me.  Only a few of the articles that I read strike me as something I want to preserve.  I found one today, and it goes into a new category.  Yet in truth, it was only salient to me because I recently wrote [[envs100disc7-climatejustice]].

Copied for preservation at my SO's suggestion;
Originally written for the Freedom oF Form Discord server:

The reliance of life extension on curing every edge-case is real, which leads to a lot of incrementalism in the field.  An example that has been given to me on many occasions is that cancer isn't one disease, it's millions of diseases; a hundred thousand cancers get cured every year.  (That was an attempt at an aphorism, mind you; it is not in any way made of 'real' estimates.)  Yet as we cure a hundred thousand cancers (aphoristically), we get better at understanding cancer as such.  We learn more of what matters in its cellular environment.  Researchers are defining the category and looking for what breaks it overall.

As we study edge cases, we build categories; when category-breaking cures are implemented, we get breakthroughs.  Although traditional vaccines only work preventatively, their ability to extirpate categories of sickness makes them a classic category buster.  The whole protocol for researching a vaccine can be defined well enough that its researchers need little fundamental insight and creativity. They only need a target to which the protocol applies.

A definition for how to invent cancer cures would be the actual 'cure for cancer' that would break cancer's hold on mortality, even though there would probably still be many cancer syndromes defying standard protocols.  The creative oncologists would still exist, turning their efforts towards trying to cure those!

I think RNA vaccination could be the category buster in cancer by enabling humanity to provide arbitrary peptide targets to the immune system, but I'm even more excited by the potential in tolerogenesis that RNA transfection provides.  I think immunosenescence is caused by accumulated error from thermodynamically improbable self-protein interactions.  I therefore hypothesize that if mistargeted immunoresponses could be forced out, the immune system would remain in a competent 'young' state indefinitely.

Anomaly:  I found the preceding essay on my clipboard *before* I decided to copy-paste it here.  It was already copied before I copied it.  Why did that happen?

This thought isn't well-formed enough to add to any of my notes projects, but I wonder if peripheral lymphocyte replenishment slows with age as a consequence of increased self-reactivity among T- and B-cells.  This is a 'selfish' speculation, as it draws from an ideal world conjecture presuming the validity of my hypothesis that immunosenescence is caused by accreted mislearning in the immune system.  I propose that accreted mislearning could also decrease the survival rate of naive cells during self-target testing, as the immune system always tries to choke its lymphocyte production in a way that prevents the release of autoreactive immune cells.

Something I'm reading recreationally.  Obvious personal interest, but it's not exactly based on what I have in my files for studying specific subjects.

Part of what's fun about reading these is chasing the references.  If something seems interesting, the reference can be pulled to try to learn more about it.  In this case, "TH17 differentiation" is an immunological process implicated in immunosenescence, and I'm curious about it because I want to see if I can weigh it against my conjecture that immunosenescence is based upon thermodynamically improbable interactions with self-proteins.  Do self-protein interactions result in some way in the increasing-with-age expression of AP-1?

TH17 cells are helper-T cells with reduced resistance to self-targeting.  They are more likely to carry self antigens.  They produce the pro-inflammatory interleukin-17 (IL-17) and as this trait is distinctive they are sometimes known as IL-17 producing helper T cells.  This is my current understanding of TH17 cells.

This source is putatively about what biochemical factor controls how many TH17 cells the immune system controls.  It claims that BATF "and the closely related BATF3" are required for the differentiation of IL17-producing helper T cells (aka TH17 cells).

BATF is "basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like", and it interacts via dimerization (molecular bonding) with the "Jun" family of proteins.  This looks like it may be a little too specific to be easily learned about.

If BATF is a transcription factor, then it's being used to promote or reduce protein production via binding to the DNA.  AP-1 expression increases with age; TH17 diferentiation increases with age.  What's going on?

This is an overview on BATF.

I'm not sure it helps me.  I feel a bit mired.  The autoreactivity profile of TH17 means that increasing TH17 expression with age *is* an example of mislearning in the immune system, but proving a relationship between TH17 expression and other forms of immune response mislearning looks like it'll be difficult, presuming of course that such a relationship exists in the first place.

This source attributes substantial cellular plasticity to TH17 cells.  Cellular plasticity is the ability of a cell to reversibly adopt different cellular phenotypes.  I find this source dense and difficult to study, so it's hard to record my thoughts as I go.  The way genetics research talks about the causal implications of genes is difficult in general, I think.  X controls Y, Y controls Z...  yes, but how do we get a targeted effect?  Ehh...  I assume this complaint reflects my poor understanding.

It looks like this identifies two phenotypes of TH17.  CD27+ and TH1-analogue?  Or is it CD27- and CD27+, which is TH1-analogue?  I'll have to come back to this one someday if I'm to hope to understand it.

Trying to look up TH17 cells, I find evidence of disagreement or uncertainty about the properties of TH17 cells.  Not for the first time, I'm noticing that immunology is less of a settled and confident field than I expected.  There's a lot of potential here.

I am not however successfully relating this to tolerogenesis.  I'm still very interested in this lens, but I think it'll take quite a long time for me to read enough of the associated material to understand it.

How do TH17 cells interact with dendritic cells?

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23352235/ (Segura, E.  Touzot, M.  Bohineust, A.  Cappucio, A.  Chiocchia, G.  Hosmalin, A.  Dalod, M.  Soumelis, V.  Amigorena, S.  (2013, Feb 21.)  Human inflammatory dendritic cells induce Th17 cell differentiation.  *Immunity*.  Retrieved 2021-2-20.)

That may have been a good question!  I may have to link this one into one of my main notes files, and link back to this day log from it.  For now, it stays in the day logs, because this is something I'm studying for interest rather than ambition.

This describes IL-17 production by memory CD4+ T cells as being stimulated by inflammatory dendritic cells.  These inflammatory dendritic cells (infDCs) appear at the sites of pathogenic inflammation and in models of inflammatory diseases such as asthma and arthritis.  I haven't seen this infDC distinction drawn before, though neither is it alien; in my own thoughts, I had been considering dendritic cells to operate in adjuvant (immune stimulating) vs tolerogenic (or anergizing) modes.

The stimulation of IL-17 production may be linked to stimulation by a superantigen?  Superantigens induce excessive and nonspecific activation of the immune system.  I may have misunderstood the reference to a superantigen in this source.

This source concludes that TH17 differentiation is specifically induced by IL-23, interleukin-23.  Hm.  Not IL-17?

I think I've done as much as I can do for now.  I need to stop for the evening.  How's my conjecture that immunosenescence is caused by cumulative mislearning holding up?  I consider it neither confirmed nor rejected.  Something that occurred to me is that if the dendritic cells are accumulating improperly identified self-as-other antigens due to thermodynamically improbable self-protein interactions, they may be in some way recruiting for the kind of immune cell most inclined to attack the proteins that they've thus improperly identified as threats.  Since TH17 cells have the highest autoreactivity of the three Helper T cell lineages, that would result in increased recruitment of TH17 cells.

Yet I have established the existence of no such mechanism.  It remains a conjecture.
