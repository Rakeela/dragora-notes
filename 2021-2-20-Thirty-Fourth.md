#2021-2-20-Thirty-Fourth

I'm in pain today, and having trouble getting started on any sensible endeavor.  "It's Saturday, so that's okay," is probably what my husband would say; sadly, my college puts most of its due dates on Sunday (IMO that should be Friday, Monday, or Wednesday) so I'm used to thinking of Saturdays and Sundays as working days.  I thought maybe I was just exhausted, so I drank an overstrength energy drink.  Now I feel considerably less exhausted, but not any less in pain!  Caffeine plus pain equals agitation.  So I'm writing this, because I can, and because doing so feels better than not.  It's a way to associate my way through my thoughts and bring something to order from them.

I've added [[Environmental News Archive]] to the dragora archive here.  I'm not sure about the naming of it.  I'm still uncommitted to this news archiving business.  Something about it doesn't grab me.  Only a few of the articles that I read strike me as something I want to preserve.  I found one today, and it goes into a new category.  Yet in truth, it was only salient to me because I recently wrote [[envs100disc7-climatejustice]].

Copied for preservation at my SO's suggestion;
Originally written for the Freedom oF Form Discord server:

The reliance of life extension on curing every edge-case is real, which leads to a lot of incrementalism in the field.  An example that has been given to me on many occasions is that cancer isn't one disease, it's millions of diseases; a hundred thousand cancers get cured every year.  (That was an attempt at an aphorism, mind you; it is not in any way made of 'real' estimates.)  Yet as we cure a hundred thousand cancers (aphoristically), we get better at understanding cancer as such.  We learn more of what matters in its cellular environment.  Researchers are defining the category and looking for what breaks it overall.

As we study edge cases, we build categories; when category-breaking cures are implemented, we get breakthroughs.  Although traditional vaccines only work preventatively, their ability to extirpate categories of sickness makes them a classic category buster.  The whole protocol for researching a vaccine can be defined well enough that its researchers need little fundamental insight and creativity. They only need a target to which the protocol applies.

A definition for how to invent cancer cures would be the actual 'cure for cancer' that would break cancer's hold on mortality, even though there would probably still be many cancer syndromes defying standard protocols.  The creative oncologists would still exist, turning their efforts towards trying to cure those!

I think RNA vaccination could be the category buster in cancer by enabling humanity to provide arbitrary peptide targets to the immune system, but I'm even more excited by the potential in tolerogenesis that RNA transfection provides.  I think immunosenescence is caused by accumulated error from thermodynamically improbable self-protein interactions.  I therefore hypothesize that if mistargeted immunoresponses could be forced out, the immune system would remain in a competent 'young' state indefinitely.

Anomaly:  I found the preceding essay on my clipboard *before* I decided to copy-paste it here.  It was already copied before I copied it.  Why did that happen?

This thought isn't well-formed enough to add to any of my notes projects, but I wonder if peripheral lymphocyte replenishment slows with age as a consequence of increased self-reactivity among T- and B-cells.  This is a 'selfish' speculation, as it draws from an ideal world conjecture presuming the validity of my hypothesis that immunosenescence is caused by accreted mislearning in the immune system.  I propose that accreted mislearning could also decrease the survival rate of naive cells during self-target testing, as the immune system always tries to choke its lymphocyte production in a way that prevents the release of autoreactive immune cells.

Something I'm reading recreationally.  Obvious personal interest, but it's not exactly based on what I have in my files for studying specific subjects.
