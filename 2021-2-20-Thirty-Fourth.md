#2021-2-20-Thirty-Fourth

I'm in pain today, and having trouble getting started on any sensible endeavor.  "It's Saturday, so that's okay," is probably what my husband would say; sadly, my college puts most of its due dates on Sunday (IMO that should be Friday, Monday, or Wednesday) so I'm used to thinking of Saturdays and Sundays as working days.  I thought maybe I was just exhausted, so I drank an overstrength energy drink.  Now I feel considerably less exhausted, but not any less in pain!  Caffeine plus pain equals agitation.  So I'm writing this, because I can, and because doing so feels better than not.  It's a way to associate my way through my thoughts and bring something to order from them.

I've added [[Environmental News Archive]] to the dragora archive here.  I'm not sure about the naming of it.  I'm still uncommitted to this news archiving business.  Something about it doesn't grab me.  Only a few of the articles that I read strike me as something I want to preserve.  I found one today, and it goes into a new category.  Yet in truth, it was only salient to me because I recently wrote [[envs100disc7-climatejustice]].
