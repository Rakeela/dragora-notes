#Event-Horizon-1997

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Forgotten

I think I watched this one when it was still pretty new.  I loved and hated this movie when I watched it as a kid.  It was way too scary for me!  Yet I loved the idea of a sci-fi adventure through a dangerous warp space.

I had this one marked as having never been rewatched, but I think I've actually watched it twice.
