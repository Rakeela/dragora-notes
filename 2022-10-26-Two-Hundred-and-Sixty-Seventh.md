I played a bit of Terra Invicta today.  I've loaded up the game under The Academy.  Trying to ally is the cause worth fighting for.  I don't think I'm any good at the game, and it's such a looooong game.  I've just been playing by my instincts, which is to do my idealistic best and hope things come together.  It works in a surprising number of games.  This one may be the exception.  I don't know if my bad mental state allows me the patience to find out.  I'm pretty sure that I've made more councillor shuffles than would be ideal, and my current councillor-loadout still isn't good.  I don't have a councillor capable of Hostile Takeover.

Wow, this post really didn't need to happen, but whatever.  Up it goes.  Maybe someday someone will instantiate an AI based on my writings.
