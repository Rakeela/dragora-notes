Commentary 1-A:
The Univeral Peace Institute gaining strength in an environment of smugglers, pirates, and rebels really captured my imagination.  It stalled my RftG games until I put this together.  The smuggling lair is considered a rare mineral world...  The powerful prospecting guild here appealed to me, too.  It's the capstone of the tableau and it suggests that this empire has an engine of mining productivity backing it.  The fact that all of its miners are scofflaws really makes it fascinating.  There's a combination of danger and idealism in this tableau.  The Rebel Alliance is just as powerful as the Prospecting Guild despite the negative military this tableau achieves.  Are they not using military means to obtain their goals?  They double up with the Universal Peace Institute on gaining value out of military worlds, suggesting this empire is extra-powerful when it acquires the allegiance of militarily dangerous allies, despite the fact that it deploys no conquest.  The only conquest on the tableau was the Smuggling Lair.  The Smuggling Lair is interesting in its own right; its consume power yields two cards for any kind of resource.  This suggests that resources disposed of through the smuggling lair leak off into achievements of which nobody would boast, and in exchange they provide financial rewards and interesting opportunities, ie cards.  The cards in this game represent both money and information, and the Smuggling Lair contributed to this tableau's progression.  Ultimately, in this context, the smugglers must be interpreted idealistically: they contributed to the founding of the Universal Peace Institute, the Galactic Federation, the Rebel Alliance, and the Prospecting Guild.  They should also be interpreted as influential: they yield extra value to three out of the four 6-cost developments on the field, being worth a total of 5 VP on the tableau considering their impact on the 6-costs.

Commentary 1-B (2023-12-22):
I believe this 8-point score was the highest value I've ever seen on the Universal Peace Institute.  Hopefully I'll think to record the tableau if I score a higher valuation on it.

Total Military:  +5
Total Victory Points:  51
Total Prestige - 6

Commentary 2:
The Imperium Warlord being a 2-point "World" is interesting.  This guy's service costs like a world and pays like a world.  He's a real empire-builder.  In this case, he recruited troops and weapons smugglers, then conquered a fuel depot and a fuel refinery, building a logistical basis for - guess what? - further expansion of his military.  The information hub and the pan-galactic hologrid is an interesting swerve.  It's this investment in entertainment for his empire, the bread and circuses, and he gains more out of that than he does from finding and conquering the rebel homeworld.  His empire's affluence keeps growing from there, pouring resources into an enviable standard of living.  Even his fuel resources from the Fuel Depot start pouring into making the empire more affluent.  The military conquest spree gains an idealistic tinge with the Pan-Galactic League, which brings together all of these military worlds in a more pacifist way.  But then the capstone?  The pirate world.  It boosts the League by a point, and the Hologrid by two.  This is an empire of scoundrels, but they have fun.

Commentary 3:
I saved this one mostly because I was stunned to reach 18 points on the Terraforming Guild.  Combined with the Golden Age of Terraforming, this suggests that the Terraforming Guild spread across the galaxy creating a massive amount of habitable land and becoming the galaxy's most powerful organization by far.  One of the AIs in this game played the New Galactic Order, and they got up to +7 military.  That's pretty good.  I imagined the New Galactic Order expanding into this vast number of habitable worlds, just as they wanted to, but choking on the amount of peaceful expansion that the Terraforming Guild makes possible for everyone.  Every peaceful faction gets denser and denser, harder and harder to fight, while the New Galactic Order grows overwhelmed with the logistical burden of non-militant expansion until it gets walled off and collapses under its own weight.  Anyways, even the Galactic Survey project is more powerful than the New Galactic Order!  Can you imagine?  This big scary military nation, and the galactic surveyors scoff at their tiny reach while spreading to every corner of the galaxy.  Another of the AIs played Pan-Galactic Affluence and got to 10 prestige, so I guess they have a very famously luxurious lifestyle, but they didn't translate it to effective control of the galaxy.  So they're a pocket of abject luxury, but not a galactic contender.  The third AI played the New Economy, and got it to 8 VP, so I guess even the New Economy overpowers the New Galactic Order... consider that!  +7 military, and it got outdone by the economies of every other faction.  But none outdid it so much as the Terraforming Guild, who created homes for innumerable people in an age of expansion.

Commentary 4:
Earth's Lost Colony, the Secluded World, and the Space Port are all novelties producers.  This was an economy founded not on advanced technology, not on identifying ideal genes, and not on securing rare minerals, but on making the coolest consumer experiences.  They advertised them to the galaxy.  This could have been a society without ambition, but then they (founded? purchased? allied?) the Pan-Galactic Security Council, setting their foot on the galactic stage.  From there, they created a boast of affluence, using their consumer goods production to establish a galaxy-famous quality of life that could attract everyone into their sphere of influence.  They secured a famous galactic power broker, then established banks across the galaxy.  They built up a public entertainment system without parallel (that is what I imagine the Pan-Galactic Hologrid to be) so that the whole galaxy would enter into the experiences they were created.  From there, they founded (this is definitely founding) the Federation Capital, and launched the Galactic Federation to bind the whole galaxy into their voluntary association of hedonological superiority.  The feather in their cap?  The empath world.  Earth's Lost Colony established a society that truly, truly understand people, and they took over the galaxy without firing a shot.

Commentary 5:
The alien research team is always a difficult start, narratively.  Why did they swerve instantly into breeding uplifts for genes?  Obviously, they were selling genes and seeking prestige.  Creating superior genes is quite a research legacy, but it doesn't reveal anything of the precursors.  They then acquired the alien robot sentry, which I've also always found difficult narratively.  How good could a single robot sentry be that they worked out extraordinary precursor technologies out of it?  I guess it must have been one of the most amazing pieces of robot technology in the galaxy.  Anyways, they sold off that windfall.  They then acquired the alien outpost, and they processed that for prestige, boosting their fame as alien researchers.  Meanwhile they continued selling uplift genes, expanding their markets first with galactic advertisers, then with the acquisition of Old Earth.  Imagine, Earth being acquired by a budding alien empire that just wants to sell genetically advanced uplifts!  Are the uplift individuals given their own rights?  Are these aliens slave traders?  Or are they running a voluntary breeding program and running geneticist labs to identify superior genes in their breeding population?  Earth is definitely a market for genes.  There's a lot of that on Earth today.  The alien cornucopia is where the alien technology market really starts to take off.  At this point, the alien researchers have figured out enough about the alien technologies to start making amazing advances based on them.  They entrench their economy in a basis of precursor technology.  The ravaged uplift world is a naked prestige (none of the AIs in this game had any uplift worlds), though it also generates genes that don't go to waste.  Earth gets more uplift genes!  The alien rosetta stone world boosts the alien cornucopia yet again, and then the contact specialists enable the acquisition of the alien booby trap without a military investment.  The universal peace institute is a welcome finisher, though it isn't exceptionally powerful in this timeline.  It still represents the establishment of a firm logistical network (that expansion cost reduction) and an empire disinterested in militant acquisition.  The alien research team wins the galaxy on a platform of peaceful exploitation of advanced genes and advanced technologies, without much of a base in consumer technology or rare minerals.  Presumably their technology is an advanced mix of automation and organic solutions enabling them to use common resources and renewable power sources to solve problems.

Commentary 6-A (2024-01-18)
This was solid mining, almost monomaniacal, and it worked.  I actually discarded the Merchant Guild early on, but it came back to me, and I played it when it did.  Narratively, Alpha Centauri founded the Interstellar Prospectors, they found a solid Mining World and founded a Mining Conglomerate.  The conglomerate wanted to get into public works, but it still kept expanding its influence in rare minerals, expanding into the munitions supply chain to expand its market.  New Economy is a sticky wicket in my narratives; it's such a vapid buzzword phrase that I think, "What?  What is the new economy supposed to mean?"  Looking at the effects, we see that it privileges consumption powers (especially from developments) and gives one card per consume phase.  This suggests that the New Economy represents a government that is keenly searching the galaxy for needs to fulfill using its resources.  The Comet Zone is just another Mining World in pretty much all senses, except in space.  The Imperium Troops were supposed to start conquering the Rebel Miners, but a settle phase wasn't played in a timely manner, so I played the more powerful Golden Age of Terraforming instead...  this budding little empire started turning uninhabitable worlds into usable territories using its massive production of rare minerals to fuel a terraforming engine.  From there, the true masterpiece of the tableau, the Merchant Guild.  Absolutely powerful, the Merchant Guild rose high on the back of massive productivity, having a tremendous amount of resources to throw around.  The alien robotics factory is off-theme, as final plays often are, but suggests that this empire reactivated precursor industrial architecture to start expanding its technology base in extraordinary ways.

Commentary 6-B (2024-01-18)
This game was up against a rival empire that scored 73 points.  The rival's tableau started with industrial robots, then had a pan-galactic mediator, then had export duties, then had a 17-value pan-galactic affluence (!), then a contact specialist, terraforming robots, 5-value uplift code, imperium cloaking technologies, devolved uplift species, 4-value galactic renaissance, 10-value galactic bankers, galactic markets, and finally a pirate world.  So the rival had a truly, unbelievably, staggeringly good quality of life, and all the galaxy wanted to live like they did... but they still lost to the mining megacorp founded in alpha centauri.  The galaxy's bankers rallied to the awesomeness of the most affluent robot-powered civilization, but they were bested by the merchant guild.

Commentary 7
This set my record for most victory point chips attained in a single game at 56.  This was a hyper-effective economy which I imagine set the galaxy standard for civilian achievement.  The nearest rival scored only 48 points with an 11-point Pan-Galactic Affluence, suggesting that they had a higher quality of life, but still their people achieved far less.  This is suggestive that in this setting, the most affluent people were also lazy!  Like on Earth, where the rich don't do anything of use.  Here, the ancient race made contact with yucky eugenicist matchmakers, and proceeded to harvest genepower by selectively breeding their most intelligent animals.  They used their genetic resources to fuel a colonization venture that discovered evidence of precursor intelligence and promptly commercialized it.  Then they made a huge discovery: a world of psychic crystals!  This enabled them to take an anti-military stance, confident that they had non-military means of protecting themselves.  They proceeded to discover a rich world of less psychic crystals, too.  Then they made contact with Old Earth and poured resources into making Old Earth awesome.  The Galactic Genome Project underperformed in this history, but still did its best to catalogue and research the genetic resources of the ancient race and their uplift gene breeders, and provided a substantial amount of victory points (like 15) from processing genes into VP.  The refugees were integrated effectively into a society eager to make something of them, and the mining robots were used to harvest the mentally difficult resources of the psionic crystals.  Finally, the Terraforming Guild was powerful here, with lots of maybe-productive worlds that it could build into a formidable empire.

Entry Eight

Total Military: +2
Total Victory Points: 56
Total Prestige: 9

Commentary 8-A
I won without victory point chips, just on my tableau (and prestige).  This was a nearly-monomaniacal alien strategy.  I got the cards for it and kept going.  I used the consume phase to gain a prestige and a card.  I didn't have a proper victory point engine at all, suggesting that this society had difficulty translating its technological knowledge into civilian achievement and future investment.  I clearly would have lost if I hadn't drawn the Alien Tech Institute.  I played the Imperium Lords as well, thinking I would get card draw off of it by the three military worlds my alien research team colonized, which narratively suggests the formation of a kind of aristocracy empowered by alien technology, though at 5 VP it's not an especially powerful one.  These alien researchers expanded into the galaxy seeking precursor technology and absolutely maximized their ability to interface with it.  The alien technology became their own technology.

Commentary 8-B (2024-01-19)
This was a close game with the other AIs scoring 56 points, 47 points, and 51 points, so I imagine this galaxy became a multipolar world with several contending superpowers.  The military scores were 2, 3, 3, and 4, suggesting relatively even military development in the different superpowers.  The second place opponent launched Terraforming Engineers and the Federation Capital, feeding the federation with genetic resources from the alien race and a genes lab to produce prestige.  They built the Imperium Planet Buster and the Expedition Force, suggesting that they invested in a high-and-low military strategy with a few gigantic ships and a fleet of primarily exploratory vessels with some combat power.  They also hired a Pan-Galactic Emissary, showing they were willing to negotiate and not necessarily only use force.  They had runaway robots.

Commentary 8-C (2024-01-19)
The third place opponent launched the Golden Age of Terraforming, but it wasn't that impressive at a mere 5 points; their tableau has 4 windfall worlds and only 3 production worlds.  They did however get 24 victory point chips, suggesting substantial civilian development and investment in an economic engine that would play out well in the post-game.  They had New Earth, the Imperium Blaster Gem Consortium, and the Mining Mole Uplift Race, suggesting a lot of rare mineral (and underground) development.  They had the ravaged uplift world, from which they farmed 7 prestige, suggesting they were famous for caring for an abandoned uplift population that had been terribly mistreated.  They had the Alien Toy Shop, which contains powerful artifacts (2 VP per turn-in on its resources), but which is only worth 1 victory point on its own (presumably because they're odd and hard to understand).  They also had the Alien Oort Cloud Refinery, which produces the omni-good, but which is yet another windfall.  They were too windfall heavy, especially for having started with the Gateway Station.  They built the Pilgrimage World, suggesting their economy had a limitless demand for goods as it served the galaxy's pilgrims to a particularly famed and sacred world.  They also built Drop Ships, suggesting they were ready and willing to take whole worlds by massive invasion.

Commentary 8-D (2024-01-19)
The fourth place opponent was New Sparta.  They expanded into the Pre Sentient Race, who annoy me greatly because 'sentient' means 'feeling' and what it should be is Pre Sapient Race, since virtually all multicellular life forms are sentient whereas only a minority of them are sapient.  They then expanded into the Alien Tourist Attraction, suggesting a civilian development path, then they added the Destroyed World.  They added Uplift Gene Breeders to their tableau and farmed a bunch of prestige off them (total prestige 8), meaning they had great success with selective breeding of intelligent lifeforms (maybe they were uplifting their Pre *Sapient* Race).  They colonized the Interstellar Prospectors, which would greatly expand the value of their Destroyed World.  They conquered an Alien Robot Sentry (2 VP) and then settled the Plague World.  They built the New Economy (what IS the New Economy?) for a poor total of 6 victory points, suggesting they made something of it, but not a lot.  They conquered a former penal colony, then made contact with Galactic Markets.  All in all, this is a surprisingly civilian trajectory for New Sparta, tallying +3 military and 21 victory points.  If I were ever to write with this, I would make them a generic unproductive warrior race, and maybe I'd give them an unintelligent but numerous and well-adapted presapient species on their homeworld that they integrated their society with.

Commentary 9-A:
This is the alien research team doing what it hopes to achieve in the galaxy.  Their first find came immediately as they made contact with an alien robot scout ship.  By the technology of this one functional scout ship alone, they learned enough to found the Alien Tech Institute.  They invested in a pan-galactic mediator hoping to buff their reputation when they made peaceful contact with ancient precursor intellects, but their next acquisition was an alien oort cloud refinery.  From there they acquired an alien uplift center, suggesting that the galaxy's current species may be ancient alien uplifts.  They joined the rebel pact after that, hoping to secure the aid of the galactic rebellion in accessing alien technologies, though this didn't really pan out as no further military acquisitions occurred.  Still, it suggests that these researchers have a liberationist side.  They accessed the alien data repository after that, gaining a massive perennial source of information into the aliens, then launched the Alien Cornucopia initiative to truly advance their economy on the basis of precursor technologies.  They found the Alien Rosetta Stone World, easing translation difficulties and making their existing worlds more productive.  From there, the feather in their cap was the Artist Colony.  Isn't the worth of advancement the creation of beauty?

Commentary 9-B:
Coming in at 53 points, one of the AIs founded the Universal Peace Institute.  Their tableau was considerably less valuable, but they generated 10 points of prestige and 22 points of victory chips.  They got the Deserted Alien World, something the Alien Research Team would've loved to have.  At 48 points, third place got the Alien Departure Point, and thus knew where the precursors *went*.  They also had the galaxy's third most powerful organization: a 10-point Terraforming Guild.  Third place had 14 points with a 2-point Uplift Code that went nowhere, but they also had the Deserted Alien Library, so I guess they scored some precursor literature.

Commentary 10-A:
This tableau emblemizes one of the core peculiarities of Race for the Galaxy.  The Rebels and the Imperium score off of the same cards, so if you're playing one, it makes sense to play the others.  Are they the same group?  Are the rebels conquering the Imperium?  Are the Imperium conquering the rebels?  Are both sides being played off against the other in an eternal war that exists to distract from the shadowy players manipulating both sides?  Are both sides expanding a shared national identity that they squabble over?

Commentary 10-B:
Here we have the Rebel Cantina starting out with investment credits.  I played investment credits because it's a good card when it's played early.  I was reasonably confident of getting its value in cards.  Narratively, it suggests a certain pro-development entrepreneuralness, and it's obvious how that could help fuel the development of mining robots.  The rebel fuel cache was gathered and sold to fund further acquisitions.  The mining robots automatically restocked the cache, but it paid the price of nothing impressive for a while - the string of low-cost, low-valuecards that follows attests to that.  The alien burial site is off-theme, but I can imagine it as an opportunistic acquisition when it was incidentally discovered in the territory of this expanding... what are they, a rebelliously-inclined megacorporation?  The rebel convict mines were conquered by the imperium troops, so maybe they're not rebelliously-inclined.  Lifeforms Inc. is an interesting card that suggests the development of custom lifeforms for terraforming work - they make colonization cheaper if you spend genes resources.  Very biopunk, too.  Just having regular production of lifeforms for the economy.  Yet the Imperium Seat wasn't developed with their aid, and the Rebel Underground and the Rebel Freedom Fighters were both conquests.  The Rebel Alliance throws this narrative into disarray as suddenly it sounds like the rebels are working closely with the Imperium Seat, both of them scoring off the same cards.  Then finally the genes resources from Lifeforms Inc. pay off, making it possible to settle the Imperium Capital in the same turn as the development of the Rebel Alliance...  Does the rebel alliance control the imperium capital, or does the imperium capital control the rebel alliance?

Commentary 10-C:
Comically, one of the AIs developed a 3-point Galactic Imperium, colonizing a single Rebel Colony.  Another of the AIs had the starting 'world' of the Imperium Warlord.  Meanwhile, none of the four players had a positive general military value in the end.  The Imperium Warlord tableau also contained the Psi-Crystal World and the Contact Specialists...  This ended up being something of a peaceful galaxy.  Maybe the conflict was generally non-violent and, as I pointed out, possibly controlled from both sides by one major expansionistic organization.

Commentary 11-A:
I believe this is the lowest score I've won with.  I play four player vs medium bots.  The hard bots are a better challenge, but they're narratively nonsensical and pressurize a vision of perfect play that erodes my narrative preferences.  The medium bots are occasionally trivial, and they were this time.  I wanted to record it as 'my lowest winning score' when I won with 33, so I figured I'd better record it when I won with 30.

Commentary 11-B:
The nomad raiders ran a military campaign here.  They barely used their +2 sales bonus; that only came up once with some rare minerals from the Imperium Fuel Depot.  I thought I'd get Imperium cards, but I didn't get that many, nor did I get the payoff cards for it.  The story here is a straightforward military expansion story, though the Bank, the Trade Emissaries, and the Bankers suggest a certain amount of unethical raw greed backing the expansion plans.  A capital effort!  The devolved uplift race is probably being mercilessly exploited by these guys. and they aren't even getting a lot from it considering they don't have any six costs that it plays into, nor did they get victory point chips (at all, in the entire game).  With no consumer economy at all, this is probably a horrible society.  With low-scoring competitors, this is probably a horrible underdeveloped galaxy... and it's dominated by militant capitalists, hah!

Commentary 12-A:
This was a Doomed World start that turned the Doomed World into the Gene Designers.  How does that make sense?  How do the Gene Designers absorb an entire world into their efforts?  I've got nothing.  But!  It works by the mechanics, I've done it before, and it's one of the best trades available for the Doomed World.

Commentary 12-B:
The trifecta of Investment Credits, Galactic Federation, and Pan-Galactic Research reduces development costs by 4 points, making developments stupidly cheap.  I got them 5 off by playing the development action myself on most of these actions.  Narratively, this is a society that is *extremely* good at vertical development.  Their society is tall, tall, and tall.  And when they'd built all of that, the first thing they built was a bank, further enhancing their ability to develop.  They then founded the Rebel Alliance, when they had no rebel cards at all.  But oh!  Incoming flood of rebel cards.  There's no question of possibly conquering the rebels with this tableau.  They developed the rebellion from nothing.  And they did it with the Universal Peace Institute on their side, suggesting that they were developing a non-violent rebellion... even though they built the Rebel Sneak Attack.  They have no apparent intention of making sneak attacks.  It boosts the value of the Galactic Bankers and the Galactic Federation.  What kind of sneaky are they being?

Commentary 12-C:
I had to throw out a good alien card during this game due to a glitch in the explore phase that forced me to keep a different card that phase.  It lead to a better narrative, frankly.  I might've otherwise ended with the Alien Tech Institute and the Alien Robotics Factory, instead of another two Rebel cards.

Commentary 13-A:
This economy is hot, hot, hot.  They're earning and spending like crazy.  Their production phases draw in a massive amount of resources, both resource cards and just plain cards to play, and they can consume both for victory points.  They use their surplus cards to fuel deficit spending, fearlessly sinking opportunities chasing every morsel of progress, because as long as the economy turns, they generate new opportunities relentlessly.  They even draw a card on consume phases courtesy of Galactic Trade Emissaries.  This game drew in a very respectable 36 victory point chips through consuming resources for VP.  

Commentary 13-B:
It tends to feel good when I can get the Research Labs consuming genes resources for VP.  That suggests genetic research being put to permanent gains in quality of life.  Better agriculture, better health, better ecology.  The Lost Species Ark World is here used as a research source to better the galaxy.

Commentary 13-C:
I got even more out of the Alien Toy Shop.  A 3x consume and a 2x consume on its 2 VP output yielded 10 victory points from that card's consume outlet alone.  What the precursors thought of as mere toys transformed the societies that excavated the precursor settlements.  The alien data repository yielded a mere 2 VP from consuming its technology, through the Galactic Studios with a 2x.  So the alien data was used for a bit of fun, but the alien toys were used for everything.
