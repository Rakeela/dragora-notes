Commentary 1-A:
The Univeral Peace Institute gaining strength in an environment of smugglers, pirates, and rebels really captured my imagination.  It stalled my RftG games until I put this together.  The smuggling lair is considered a rare mineral world...  The powerful prospecting guild here appealed to me, too.  It's the capstone of the tableau and it suggests that this empire has an engine of mining productivity backing it.  The fact that all of its miners are scofflaws really makes it fascinating.  There's a combination of danger and idealism in this tableau.  The Rebel Alliance is just as powerful as the Prospecting Guild despite the negative military this tableau achieves.  Are they not using military means to obtain their goals?  They double up with the Universal Peace Institute on gaining value out of military worlds, suggesting this empire is extra-powerful when it acquires the allegiance of militarily dangerous allies, despite the fact that it deploys no conquest.  The only conquest on the tableau was the Smuggling Lair.  The Smuggling Lair is interesting in its own right; its consume power yields two cards for any kind of resource.  This suggests that resources disposed of through the smuggling lair leak off into achievements of which nobody would boast, and in exchange they provide financial rewards and interesting opportunities, ie cards.  The cards in this game represent both money and information, and the Smuggling Lair contributed to this tableau's progression.  Ultimately, in this context, the smugglers must be interpreted idealistically: they contributed to the founding of the Universal Peace Institute, the Galactic Federation, the Rebel Alliance, and the Prospecting Guild.  They should also be interpreted as influential: they yield extra value to three out of the four 6-cost developments on the field, being worth a total of 5 VP on the tableau considering their impact on the 6-costs.

Commentary 1-B (2023-12-22):
I believe this 8-point score was the highest value I've ever seen on the Universal Peace Institute.  Hopefully I'll think to record the tableau if I score a higher valuation on it.

Entry Two:
Date:  2023-12-22
Imperium Warlord - 2
Imperium Troops - 1
Blaster Runners - 1
Imperium Fuel Depot - 1
Rebel Fuel Refinery - 2
Drop Ships - 2
Information Hub - 2
Pan-Galactic Hologrid - 9
Rebel Homeworld - 7
Pan-Galactic Affluence - 6
Pan-Galactic League - 6
Pirate World - 2
Total Military:  +5
Total Victory Points:  51
Total Prestige - 6

Commentary 2:
The Imperium Warlord being a 2-point "World" is interesting.  This guy's service costs like a world and pays like a world.  He's a real empire-builder.  In this case, he recruited troops and weapons smugglers, then conquered a fuel depot and a fuel refinery, building a logistical basis for - guess what? - further expansion of his military.  The information hub and the pan-galactic hologrid is an interesting swerve.  It's this investment in entertainment for his empire, the bread and circuses, and he gains more out of that than he does from finding and conquering the rebel homeworld.  His empire's affluence keeps growing from there, pouring resources into an enviable standard of living.  Even his fuel resources from the Fuel Depot start pouring into making the empire more affluent.  The military conquest spree gains an idealistic tinge with the Pan-Galactic League, which brings together all of these military worlds in a more pacifist way.  But then the capstone?  The pirate world.  It boosts the League by a point, and the Hologrid by two.  This is an empire of scoundrels, but they have fun.

Commentary 3:
I saved this one mostly because I was stunned to reach 18 points on the Terraforming Guild.  Combined with the Golden Age of Terraforming, this suggests that the Terraforming Guild spread across the galaxy creating a massive amount of habitable land and becoming the galaxy's most powerful organization by far.  One of the AIs in this game played the New Galactic Order, and they got up to +7 military.  That's pretty good.  I imagined the New Galactic Order expanding into this vast number of habitable worlds, just as they wanted to, but choking on the amount of peaceful expansion that the Terraforming Guild makes possible for everyone.  Every peaceful faction gets denser and denser, harder and harder to fight, while the New Galactic Order grows overwhelmed with the logistical burden of non-militant expansion until it gets walled off and collapses under its own weight.  Anyways, even the Galactic Survey project is more powerful than the New Galactic Order!  Can you imagine?  This big scary military nation, and the galactic surveyors scoff at their tiny reach while spreading to every corner of the galaxy.  Another of the AIs played Pan-Galactic Affluence and got to 10 prestige, so I guess they have a very famously luxurious lifestyle, but they didn't translate it to effective control of the galaxy.  So they're a pocket of abject luxury, but not a galactic contender.  The third AI played the New Economy, and got it to 8 VP, so I guess even the New Economy overpowers the New Galactic Order... consider that!  +7 military, and it got outdone by the economies of every other faction.  But none outdid it so much as the Terraforming Guild, who created homes for innumerable people in an age of expansion.
