#Simcity-Societies

This was a Bad Videogame, caps intended.  I don't agree with the general bad judgement against it.  It's a beautiful software toy that I've had many enjoyable hours with.  This was the true final entry in the Simcity series, to me.

I'm thinking about it today ([[2022-01-31-Two-Hundred-and-Twenty-Fifth]]) because I've been working on Theoma all day, despite feeling like absolute trash.

To extend on what I wrote yesterday...
Many of Theoma's land gods build what they call 'model cities'.  Using Fate manipulation, they create coherent societies.  They're kind of playing Simcity Societies when they do that...  They can even paper over gaps in their economy with miracles if they so choose.  Ediveyrm, for instance, is a religious community in the mountains with no agriculture and no food imports, because food in Ediveyrm is created and distributed by the land god.

It's entirely too easy in Simcity Societies to build cities without any of the "bad" stuff.  Getting industry working, for instance, takes effort that doesn't need to be exerted.  You can build a whole bunch of 'jobs' where people just talk to each other endlessly and they'll still turn up simoleons.  You're never put into a position where your economy is starving for lack of steel, no matter how many cities you build without steel mills.
