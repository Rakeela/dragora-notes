#Viceroy-Goods

The different goods of The Viceroy are fascinating to me.  "Industrial" goods are obvious, so many different kinds of goods are produced by industry.  What are "biological" and "cultural" goods?  That's what I wanted to create this to write about.  I will create a subsection for each kind of good and then I will list ideas for what might fall into each category.

Industry

I don't have any really clever ideas for what industrial goods might be.  They seem so massively diverse that I can't come up with anything clever to say.  Every kind of product not otherwise specified could be an industrial good, and every category of production would have industrial goods in its production structure, like tractors (biological) or cameras (cultural).

Biological

This is the category that really struck me.  Obviously, food is a biological good, but people can only eat so much.  As Wealth increases, they're doing more than just eating more... at least, after maybe the first Wealth increase.

Food:  At Wealth 0, there is a substantial risk of famine.  Even as early as Wealth 1, people have a sufficient basis of raw calories, though they may not eat *well*.  As Wealth increases past that point, the actual amount of food that people eat increases little if at all, but food supplies become more elaborate and more wasteful.  There is a qualitative difference in the exports to a low-Wealth economy vs the exports to a high-Wealth economy.

Medicine:  As Wealth increases, access to medicines improves, and medicines become more efficacious.  This drives down death rates with increasing Wealth, encouraging the increase of the population as lifespans improve.  Biological economies produce and process lots of interesting chemicals for export.  This category also covers recreational drugs, which become less harmful on average as Wealth increases.

Pets:  Pets exist at every Wealth level, but the animals themselves, their foods, and their medicines are part of the Biological trade.  High-Wealth societies import animals and animal supplies, potentially of increasing rarity and expense-to-care-for.  Given that I believe extreme Wealth would incorporate animal uplift, and extreme cultural technologies in this game establish technotelepathic conditions, the probability of sapient pets whose economic role is purely supportive is high.

Genes:  Rare genes are a probable economic good in the biological category.  These would be supportive of the other categories (food genes, health genes, pet genes, etc).  High Wealth economies will search through the galaxy for ideal genes to deploy, and economies seeking to export biologicals could engage in genetic research to identify exportable genes.

Parks and Wildlife:  Not a conventional export good, but nevertheless 'exports' could exist in the form of eco-tourism, interplanetary wilderness conservation projects, nature documentaries, and anything else that people on other planets might pay for.  The trade in genes could support this trade as biodiversity maintenance creates a wilderness laboratory which will evolve over time on its own.  Although increasing population puts pressure on wilderness, the game's biological technologies could also be used to improve the health of ecosystems, creating a potentially transitory window in which P&W products are popular, and a demand for newly-developing regions from which to produce them.  Demand for P&W goods would agitate against population expansion technologies; we can predict that environmentalists would dislike branching facilities.

Organic raw materials:  Such as wood or leather.  Likely to continue having applications at all Wealth levels, and straightforward to magnify production of with the biological production technologies in the game.  Extreme biotech research could produce new raw materials with exotic properties.

Minimally processed goods:  Goods worked with pre-industrial methods could qualify as biological production, such as carved ivory, simple tools, and neoprimitivist furnishings.  Conventional demand for these goods would peak at low Wealth, but they are likely to retain a small role as prestige objects even at high Wealth.

Living Technologies:  Extreme biotechnology could produce biological tools and "machines" which solve problems otherwise approached only through industry.  Starting with microbial manufacturing of interesting chemicals, this category could extend through to self-repairing buildings, and even living starships.  See also: Biopunk.  High Wealth economies may have functional monopolies on these goods, with their presence only as rare imports at the galaxy's average level of Wealth.

Cultural

I see the cultural category as "empathy, entertainment, and problem-solving".  The general sanity of the public clarifies as their Wealth permits the consumption of more and more Cultural goods.  These are mostly lots of ways of saying the same thing, however cultural activity also has a dark side.  As more cultural output is produced, good strengthens, but evil may strength as well.

Entertainment:  The obvious kind of cultural good is just entertainment works.  Every society needs this.  Wealth 0 societies suffer real and horrid deficiencies from a lack of entertainment.  Entertainment products magnify happiness and distract from suffering.  They also reduce stress, conflict, and mortality, while making people more genial to each other, all factors that encourage population levels to increase.

Fine Arts:  Equally obvious, fine arts are cultural goods.  The necessity of fine arts is less obvious, but being surrounded by beauty makes people more sane, while being surrounded by ugliness makes people less sane.  As Wealth increases, society has more resources to invest in beautification, and average levels of beauty increase, with beneficial effects on public psychology.

Social Science:  Research into how people think and interact is a cultural good.  As Wealth increases, a greater investment in social science becomes possible, and the particular quirks of a public's psychology become more attested in the literature.  This 'consumption' of social science both magnifies a peoples' influence and makes them saner.

Empathy:  The cultural technologies in this game increase the peoples' ability to understand each other.  Social Science overlaps heavily with this concept, but.  One of the things that a people who understand each other well could do, is to export to other societies the information those people need to understand each other in the same way.  Societies could use their Wealth to attempt to purchase such understandings from more empathetic societies, and this could affect a wealth transfer towards cultural producers.

Utopianism:  Culturally productive regions also represent idealized society investments that might lure interest and support from the broader galactic community on the sheer basis that they are, themselves, excellent societies.  It would be easy to attract charitable interest, converts abroad, remittances, and wealthy immigrants.  This 'good' is kind of parasitic, but the people who are giving their resources to the cultural peaks are unlikely to see themselves as being parasitized.  Utopianism could also exist as an import, as attempts are made to import functional social structures wholesale.

Social Experiments:  The darker cousin to social science and utopianism, the bizarrities of a particular district's culture will attract galactic interest.  Districts making questionable cultural decisions could be 'exporting' social experiments to the galaxy, and districts trying to improve their cultural productivity might make deliberately bizarre decisions in order to better stand out against the backdrop of galactic society.  As a district's Wealth increases, it could 'import' data from social experiments or even the experiments themselves, trying to improve itself still further.

Tech Leakage:  The specialist cultural technologies in The Viceroy are absolutely fascinating.  Goods and services based upon them are likely to have applicabilities in all kinds of societies.  Having specialists working with these technologies will naturally produce salable works derived from the technology, ready to be applied in purchasing societies, there to provide a small portion of their productive value in contribution to that society.

Hazardous Differentiation, or Internal Unity:  Two planets each with Nationalist Indoctrination are likely to develop internal consensus, while being at odds with each other, rather than uniting in a shared interplanetary consensus.  Although psychologically stressful and corrosive to empathy towards weird people, this internal unity promotes the factors of population growth.  As Wealth increases, nations will 'purchase' internal unity (and differentiation from rivals) in whatever ways they can afford, and they are likely to emulate those nations which possess already the greatest degree of internal unity.

Justifications:  Extremely cultural planets will produce a fervent morass of justifications for every kind of sapient activity.  To the extent that those justifications are effective, they will win resources from other societies, create growth in the planets producing them, and clarify the thoughts of those believing in the justifications.  The presence of these justifications will empower the productivity of 'purchasing' societies by justifying them in turn.
