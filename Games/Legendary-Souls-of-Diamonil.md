#Legendary-Souls-of-Diamonil

A general practice of writing for Polis Diamonil is that I resist naming characters.  I picked this up from my resentment for Nationstates' "random" name picker, which has stuck my own name on issues a few too many times in a few too many coincidentally insulting locations... and other insulting names, too.  So there aren't a lot of named peacock gryphons in Diamonil's history...  but there are some.  These are closely linked to the [[Faiths-of-Diamonil]].

---
Teyzaw - Originally a science fiction writer, Teyzaw was posthumously deified by her over-dedicated fanbase.  They were polite and productive people, so a community built up around them and never dispersed.

Ziazien - The most legendary psychohistographer among the chrome-mad Steelfeathers, Ziazien created a negotiation system that shaped the rest of history after his effective demise.  He was put in cryostasis and never retrieved.  He was a polite nudist and a 'Son of Teyzaw' in his first life, though after reincarnating in the [[First-Community-of-the-Steelfeather-Rapture]], he (under the name Kavikeil) converted to the Flame of the Myriad.

Tiaviel - The originator of the art of flamedancing and one of the original incendiary celebrators among the peacock gryphons, Tiaviel was a loud and enthusiastically cheerful gryphoness whose ideas were eventually taken up by the Flame of the Myriad.  (Whether or not this means she founded the faith is disputed.)  For some reason, none of her reincarnations have claimed her identity... and indeed, in Polis Diamonil, her life was unrecorded by history.  Humble despite her volume, she'd much rather be the opening act than the headliner.

Vazyiu - Although his teachings were initially an oral tradition that was not set down in his lifetime, Vazyiu was the peacock gryphon who initially conceived of the Way to Zintroth.  It's said that Vazyiu didn't accomplish much in his first lifetime, and so was forgotten even by those who kept his teachings for generations afterwards, but nevertheless the concepts of the Seekers of Zintroth largely trace back to a single thinker.

Tekazien - Styled 'the true heir of Diamonil' on the incorruptible statue in the First Community of the Steelfeather Rapture, Tekazien came to power when the sortition system in Polis Diamonil randomly drew her name.  A minor psychohistographer in a research institute prior to being elected to the government, she thereafter lead a research project that executed a 'null plan' to try to destroy an alien machine discovered under Polis Diamonil.  Cognitosphere researchers believed that the machine was mind-controlling the peacock gryphons in a way that was the actual underpinning of psychohistography; while the machine thereby greatly empowered psychohistographers, it also forced average peacock gryphons into terrible conflicts with each other.  Tekazien was willing to give up everything she knew about influencing others in the cause of freeing her people... but the success of her plan froze Polis Diamonil in a stasis bubble, as their very reality was emanent from the machine that her research team crashed.

The general naming convention for peacock gryphons should be hinted at by these names.
