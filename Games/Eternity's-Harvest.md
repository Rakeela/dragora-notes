This is a stub for a concept.  Using my notes from IIoTV, I'm considering putting together a setting that talks about my concept of three factions organized to search together (albeit rivalrously) for potentially qualified immortals.  The setting would be titled "Eternity's Harvest" and being "harvested" would be a good thing in this context.  Since I'd be writing my own story, the success rate could be much higher although the path would still be long.  A thousand years of supported candidate immortality is not a grevious burden.

This would potentially be an Orion's Arm setting.  I'm not going to study Orion's Arm quite that studiously just yet, but it's hard for me to imagine so many different levels of intelligence coexisting without trial grounds of some kind or another.

I was thinking that this would also justify a review of the IIoTV stuff which would reconsider each technology in terms of what kind of virtues it would "harvest".  It's been hard to get going though, as I immediately started reviewing Distributed Intelligence.  Distributed Intelligence strikes me as such a complex *metaphor* in The Viceroy, that if I give it to the three factions (the psuedo-Panarchic, the psuedo-Commonwealth, and the pseudo-Imperial) they'll each have their own *totally different* idea for what to use in that "slot".  So do I then put in one technology for review, or three?  Maybe I should start by reviewing what the factions would be.

Factions:
1.  Hyperconsensuals
	1.  This replaces the Panarchy.  They believe that paradisic societies should be organized without coercive force, including without state coercion, ie they believe in voluntary tax codes.  Category of sought immortal: true believers in voluntarism.
	2.  The hyperconsensuals believe in a whole lot of cultural power to try to get people to pay taxes without being **coerced** to pay taxes.  Category of sought immortal: very persuasive people.
	3.  The hyperconsensuals also value people who are placidly dedicated to (and willing to continue paying for) specific programs that the hyperconsensuals are already running.  Category of sought immortal: people who love specific programs enough to pay for them voluntarily.
	4.  Since running people in software "only costs electricity", one of the categories of people who the hyperconsensuals have a special love for are the extremely efficient people who are willing to live in pure simulation.  These ones eschew life support pods to become AI Governors.  Category of sought immortal:  true believers in simulationism.
	5.  Since they have a lot of hyper-efficient simulated people to keep entertained, the hyperconsensuals also prize entertainers.  This dovetails with their pursuit of influential people for taxpaying purposes.  Category of sought immortal: simulation programmers.
	6.  The hyperconsensuals have a grave fear of false conviction in their ideology, as imprisonment is a grave offense of forcible interconnection, namely the interconnection of the criminal and the criminal punishment system.  They do not oppose lawful conviction, but they do try to ensure that no false convictions occur.  Category of sought immortal:  Lawyers, especially defense lawyers.
2.  Planet Builders
	1.  This replaces the Empire.  The planet builders believe that society is defined by its outputs, and they never want to give up trying to increase productivity, even if that means they end up producing useless things like new planetary bodies on which dwell people they'll never meet.  Category of sought immortal:  True believers in productivism.
	2.  The planet builders usually believe in nonconsensual taxation.  One of the more prosaic kinds of people they need is therefore auditors.  The conflict between taxpayer and auditor proceeds forever in this society.  Category of sought immortal: accountants and auditors.
	3.  As in the hyperconsensuals, people who are placidly dedicated to (and willing to continue paying for) specific programs that the planet builders are already running are valued.  Everyone loves these people if they can *believe* in them; the planet builders believe in these less often than the hyperconsensuals, but do want them when they're convinced.  Category of sought immortal: people who love specific programs enough to pay for them voluntarily.  
	4.  In order to maximize productivity, many people are necessarily dedicated to inferior roles under superior direction.  The planet builders are thus pre-eminent protectors of those who do not even *wish* to govern themselves, but who seek immortality under someone else's direction.  Category of sought immortal: "mushroom people" - those who can be fed shit and kept in the dark.
	5.  Massive industrial organization requires pulling on skills and resources from massively disparate areas, as the planet builders imagine it.  This means massive investments such as space elevators and even the hollowing out of existing worlds to increase available surface area.  Category of sought immortal:  Logisticians and miners.
	6.  The massively productive engines of the planet builders demand swift and efficient justice be performed so as not to tangle the gears of their vast economic pursuits.  They have a utilitarian approach to jurisprudence and seek to be correct on average rather than correct in every case.  Category of sought immortal:  Lawyers, especially prosecutors.
3.  Unioneers
	1.  This replaces the Commonwealth.  The unioneers believe that the purpose of sapience is to be happy, and that all technology is ultimately the search for the alleviation of misery and attainment of superior happiness.  Category of sought immortal: people who make others happy.
	2.  The unioneers usually believe in nonconsensual taxation.  One of the more prosaic kinds of people they need is therefore auditors.  The conflict between taxpayer and auditor proceeds forever in this society.  Category of sought immortal: accountants and auditors.
	3.  As in the hyperconsensuals, people who are placidly dedicated to (and willing to continue paying for) specific programs that the planet builders are already running are valued.  Everyone loves these people if they can *believe* in them; the unioneers believe in these less often than the hyperconsensuals, but do want them when they're convinced.  Category of sought immortal: people who love specific programs enough to pay for them voluntarily.  
	4.  To increase the sum total happiness of the cosmos, areas that are fully happy are encouraged to increase in population to guide others to their state.  Their most developed areas strive to increase in liveable surface area accordingly.  Category of sought immortal: megastructure builders.
	5.  As the Unioneers believe in massively cooperative psychology, they want to identify people who work well with distant others.  Category of sought immortal: cultural travellers.
	6.  The Unioneers have a delicate attitude towards law, considering that legal protections are essential to the protection of *liberty itself*, since all crimes are violations of the rights of the victim.  They balance this with the concern that the law should not *itself* violate liberty, since all false convictions are violations of the rights of the accused.  Category of sought immortal:  Lawyers, especially judges.

Universally sought immortals:
1. Taxpayers are the universal category of sought immortal, hah.  People who truly believe in working to support specific programs are the ones who enable those specific programs to become larger and more uniformly implemented.  Finding taxpayers could be the whole determination of the Eternity's Harvest project and one of the ways that the "True" ideology of the program is proven.
2. Lawyers are another category of sought immortal that is rarely satiated.  The infinitely perfect court system is not attainable, but the effort to attempt it is essential.  In a post-economic society, purifying the courts 'excessively' is an ongoing affair, and the bleeding edge of justice is a grieving heart that never quits.
3. "Science of Fun" researchers are another category of sought immortal.  The people who try to study processes to make them as productive while being more fun to operate are people who make eternity more bearable in *every* role.  The Unioneers *wish* they could attain a factional monopoly on these, but they're valuable to all three factions.

Participant Kinds:
1.  Independents
	1.  Not a conventional faction, but the unfactionalized individuals who make up the simulation entrant population.  These haven't been sorted, or haven't been trained enough to be productive, or are participating in the simulation despite outstanding complaints against all three factions.
	2. Their faction affiliations are an unset liquid.  "Independent Unioneer", "Independent Planet Builder," and "Independent Hyperconsensual" are possible if and when Independents want to declare them.  So is "Independent Unaligned", which is the default "faction".
	3. Independents can leave at any time, but a lot of them have nothing waiting for them if they do.
	4. Some Independents are AIs.  See Nulls.  They have no special privileges and their computational budget is designed to make them (approximately) the equal of anyone else.
	5. Pay:  There's an indie stipend that barely exceeds the price of a life support pod.
2.  Ascendant
	1.  There's no functional difference between an ascendant and an independent, but ascendants have a job with a faction waiting for them outside of the simulations when the current session ends.  They've been identified for the Harvest as a stable immortal.
	2.  All ascendants are "ascendant faction", so there are "Ascendant Unioneer", "Ascendant Planet Builder", and "Ascendant Hyperconsensual".  Ordinarily, Ascendant faction-alignments do not fluctuate.
	3.  Ascendants are on trial as long as they stay within the simulation.  They can still be demoted, though such things are an unusual event.
	4.  Pay:  The ascendant stipend is actually rather large, as its intended to provide a cushion in case the ascendant doesn't work out in their job outside of the simulation.  This also encourages ascendants to stay with deteriorating simulation environments while trying to continue performing at their best.
3.  Governor
	1.  Governors have jobs with the factions, but those jobs are some variant of "operate the simulation from within the simulation".  They play critical roles and/or control NPC elements within the simulation (see Null).
	2.  All governors are "faction governor", reversing the template for Indies and Ascends.  So there are "Unioneer Governor", "Planet Builder Governor", and "Hyperconsensual Governor".
	3.  Not all governors are VIPs.  Some long-term indies who have been through a lot of simulations while consistently loving some collection of minor jobs get graduated to petty governor roles where they are expected to perform those minor jobs consistently.
	4.  The Hyperconsensuals are fond of recruiting ascends to become AI Governors who remain in simulation while the Hyperconsensuals dump their life support pods into the recycling system.  People who want to live forever in simulation are beloved of the Hyperconsensuals, for they require only electricity!
	5.  Pay:  Governors are getting paid to run part of the simulation.  It's a job.  That said, some hyperconsensual governors are getting paid less than the indie stipend.
4.  Null
	1.  Nulls are AI-operated characters in the simulation.  They are generally disposable.  Necessary characters with particularly bad life expectancies (such as people dwelling in active warzones, especially soldiers) are usually nulls.
	2.  Newly booted simulations start with a lot of very productive nulls, because the players haven't found their feet yet to take over those positions.
	3.  Aging simulations have a lot of very unproductive nulls, because the players are supposed to be struggling against an increasingly difficult to organize world.
	4.  Null factions, when relevant, are referred to as "faction null", thus "Unioneer Null", "Planet Builder Null", and "Hyperconsensual Null".  The majority of nulls are "Unaligned Null".
	5.  Nulls with very complex coding are occasionally identified as accidental sapiences and given the option to depart from the simulation to exist outside of it.  If they cling to life within the simulation, they're graduated to Independents.
	6.  Pay:  Nulls don't get paid.  They aren't supposed to need the money.  A null who gets graduated gets paid "back wages" as though they were a Governor, but afterwards they just get the indie stipend.  This still makes them better off than indies; being independent AIs, nulls don't *need* a life support pod to remain connected.
5.  Re-entrants
	1.  Re-entrants are people who ascended from the simulation to jobs with the exterior megastructure project(s), who have since returned to the simulation.  They may be seeking to change their job (retrain), to change their faction (realign), open a vacancy for another ascendant, or just to go on a long vacation.
	2.  As with governors, re-entrants are referred to as "faction re-entrant".  So there are "Unioneer Re-entrant", "Planet Builder Re-entrant", and "Hyperconsensual Re-entrant".
	3.  People who want to ascend sometimes greatly prize befriending re-entrants, who after all have already ascended once and know a lot about society outside of the simulation.
	4.  Re-entrants who perform poorly in the simulated worlds of the Eternity's Harvest Project risk being demoted to independents.
	5.  Pay:  Re-entrants just get the indie stipend.  Re-entrants who successfully retrain or realign can get an ascended stipend for a while.

I'm thinking that the Eternity's Harvest project is a world-of-worlds that runs in a massive post-economic virtual reality where people have signed up in billions to be sorted, elevated, and given an avenue to a broader paradise back out in the real.  At the same time, it's also a planet-building project with a massive megastructure that they extend over time based on talents surfaced in the virtual reality.  The Eternity's Harvest project is run overall by Paradise Overseers who try to fit everyone into a perfect paradise within and without the simulation.

Modelling after The Viceroy, it could be that every 'run' of a simulation in Eternity's Harvest encompasses several simulated star systems and takes 100-300 subjective years, with outliers in the 500+ year range, and these years are used to train and judge the people who signed up to participate.  Some people participate in many of them, and some of them are just using the system to recreationally live various lives.  This is an approved use of the Eternity's Harvest simulation, though the simulators try to draw people back out into the megastructure society outside of the simulations as well, via finding perfect conditions for them.

The three factions love each other and lives as equals outside of the simulations.  Inside of the simulations, they compete to win control of each simulation, presenting as competing ideological groupings that strive to secure the tax income of each simulated society.  When any of the factions successfully secure funding for initiatives, they gain points!  Eventually, each simulated territory gets oversubscribed, overtaxed, overworked, or otherwise unsustainably built up; when the available resources run out, the simulation wraps up neatly and final scores are tabulated.

Simulation Constructs
1. Unioneer
	1. Gameified Work Environments
		1. For developing and employing "science of fun" researchers to improve processes.
		2. The other factions build these as well, to contest the Unioneer monopoly on [[hedonology]].  Planet builders like this to make always-working a more emotionally sustainable thing; hyperconsensuals like them to build a more self-ordering society.
		3. Nearest Viceroy equivalent:  Leisure Subsidies
	2. Seat of Justice
		1. For developing and employing the bleeding heart of justice, forever.
		2. The other factions build these as well.  Each ideological splinter sees justice a little differently from how the others see it, and the concern for justice is a necessary part of how to build a persuasive ideal that makes people happy.
		3. This is *exactly* the same thing as in The Viceroy.  Justice is a true eternal pursuit!
		4. Nearest Viceroy equivalent:  Seat of Justice
2. Planet Builder
	1. Megastructure Design Projects
		1. When the Planet Builders build these, they're usually operated with the highest standards of realism to guarantee the development of real industrial talents.
		2. Unioneers and Hyperconsensuals build MDPs with less consistent realism to develop simulation design talents instead.
		3. These draw in curious re-entrants to view the latest marvels in simulation.
		4. Nearest Viceroy equivalent:  Unsure (Maybe Beyonder Retreats)
3. Hyperconsensual
	1. Taxation Voting
		1. One of the fond kinds of simulation for hyperconsensuals is to put together an "established" government and then unleash a taxation voting system upon it.  This causes everything in the government to be challenged by the whims of the public and the persuasive pressures people in the simulation exert on each other and on the nulls.
		2. Taxation voting leads to popular programs getting glutted and unpopular programs getting starved.  Obscure programs tend to have to be canceled outright, so that every program in government is obligated to have a marketing department.  For this reason (this hiring of excess marketers and constant marketing struggle), taxation voting is used as one of the arguments *against* hyperconsensual social orders.
		3. Despite the counterargument, all three factions have simulated this stuff at times to discover what people are willing to pay taxes for and what effects different preference structures have.  It creates persuasively powerful albeit chaotic simulations.
		4. Hyperconsensuals specifically love these simulations.  The wrangling over what is truly necessary and proper in government is something that some of them want to do forever.
		5. Nulls are usually programmed to mirror the voting patterns of the indies, but with a twist based on the 'era' of the simulation.  Early simulation nulls are programmed to resist "bad ideas" (preferences deemed disruptive), while late simulation nulls are programmed to endorse with special enthusiasm any "errors" that the indies are making.  This fluctuating challenge response patterning combined with the complex play of persuasive endeavor occasionally froths up an accidental sapience as the nulls contemplate issues.
		6. Nearest Viceroy equivalent:  Panarchialization Policy
	2. Re-entrant Resorts
		1. Intended to ease the Ascenscion process by encouraging independents and re-entrants to meet each other, re-entrant resorts also express the hyperconsensual love of simulated societies.
		2. All three factions run these, but the Hyperconsensuals (due to their love of returning to simulation) are most renowned for them.  Hyperconsensuals specifically run these as reservoirs of knowledge about how to run a society without coercion, and consider them [[hedonology]].
		3. Nearest Viceroy equivalent:  Panarchic Retreats

I think that in the translation between The Viceroy and Eternity's Harvest, all of the Population Growth Increasers will be lost.  I struggle to make sense of population growth increasers in a simulated society.
