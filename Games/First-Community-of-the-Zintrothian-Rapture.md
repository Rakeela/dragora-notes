#First-Community-of-the-Zintrothian-Rapture

The first rapture community that I attempted was from the canonically reincarnating faction of the [[Seekers-of-Zintroth]].  Their dedication to pacifistic anti-authoritarianism doesn't really gel with the NationStates mechanics much at all, yet they're really the ones who I most wanted to keep playing NationStates with.  Their dissonance with the mechanics is part of their theme.  They always *have* died an awful lot for what they believe in, and reassured by their belief in reincarnation, they've always kept at it.

I couldn't really get the concept of a nation together for the First Community, and the opening onslaught of issues sort of jolted me out of it.  Rather than settling down in a natural environment, the First Community of the Zintrothian Rapture faced down the metaphysical storm of the issue picker itself.  For some time they researched the nature of the site while being bizarrely replicated by its game mechanics, actively fighting to oppose all possible political decisions in order to avoid quelling the storm they were studying.  When they were satisfied that they'd studied it enough, they escaped it by the same mechanism that Polis Diamonil had escaped it: doing absolutely as little as possible until NationStates sent their nation to the boneyard 28 days later.

Officially, the nation's name was Zintrothian Rapture 1.  I didn't specify this at the time, but in hindsight they must've been under the leadership of [[Tekazien-the-Scholar]].  Gripping into the metaphysical nature of their reality that hard and that fast is the nature of *her* mind.
