#Operation-Inner-Space

I occasionally think back on this game, and I wanted some record of it.  It's a game where you delve into the computer itself, collecting uninfected icons and destroying infected ones.  Some levels are duels where you fight other ships, or races where you have to beat their times.  Occasionally you get sucked into a black hole where you fight the Inner Daemon.

The game had a great sense of humor, too.  The animal ships were very funny.  There were a few other gags that I don't remember as well, but none of it upset me.  It was good.

I'm happy that this game existed.  I had a lot of fun with it.  I offer thanks to this lifetime!
