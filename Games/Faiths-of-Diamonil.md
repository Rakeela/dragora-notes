#Faiths-of-Diamonil

There have always been three main faiths in Polis Diamonil, which function as sort of attractor locuses for the 'souls' of the peacock gryphons.  A considerable interplay between religious and scientific thought is historically normal for the nation, and the Diamonil avians have a long history of 'timeless' argumentation about what people and societies are like if they interact for infinite spans of time.

Daughters of Teyzaw - Formed from the zealous yet polite fan community spawned by a legendary book written by the author Teyzaw in the early eras of Polis Diamonil, the Daughters of Teyzaw are known for elaborate rituals, scientistic faith in reason, and strong demands for a large personal space bubble.  Historically, the Daughters also protected atheists, acknowledging the dubiousness of deifying a mortal author who merely wrote science fiction.  The Daughters of Teyzaw try to guide society to what they call "Teyzaw's Eternity", the particular vision of a scientific utopia that Teyzaw presented in her book.  Teyzaw's name is considered synonymous with etiquette and her faith's influence is informally credited with the long-term aversion to hostility and hatred in society.
Iconography:  Crystalline themes & 'quaint' mixes of old and new
Iconic palette:  Blue or white
Utopian belief:  Anti-rudeness

Seekers of Zintroth - Often called simply 'Seekers', the Seekers of Zintroth formed to promote pacifism in Diamonil.  They claim to believe in a mythic paradise that they call Zintroth, where no wars are ever fought and there is no need to defend oneself against any threat.  They have also historically claimed belief in reincarnation.  This has been rather important to them, as a large number of Seekers have ended up dead without defending themselves.  They believe that being martyred in the pursuit of peace to be a way to take a great step towards reincarnating within Zintroth.  The Seekers have often engaged in cultural activities (they have no prohibition even against horror movies, for example), but they have been diffident participants in the psychohistographical conflicts of Diamonil, as they do not believe they are obligated to found Zintroth upon a particular world.  They believed Polis Diamonil's world to be but one world of many worlds through which the 'Way to Zintroth' extends; this mythic road is a path of the mind which is not made of stone.
Iconography:  Hard to describe; highly abstract and/or fixated upon presenting illusions
Iconic palette:  No unifying trend.
Utopian belief:  Pacifism

Flame of the Myriad - The Flame of the Myriad worships one unknown, unnamed deity who they believe created all of reality for the purpose of people finding happiness within it.  Their celebrations are incendiary and loud.  Their signature art is firedancing.  Phoenixes are sacred to them.  They proclaim their belief that existence is joyous and that the purpose of life is happiness, but not everyone is happy with them.  They have a mixed and frightening history with the rest of society, and psychohistography has sometimes lead them to perform very dark deeds 'for the happiness of future generations'.  They are the most common faith to dissent from and incite conflicts with the other two main faiths of Diamonil in pursuit of their mandate: to defend the happiness of the public by any means necessary.
Iconography:  Fire.  Just fire, but usually in healing or enhancing motifs.
Iconic palette:  Red and yellow, but vibrance is prized over conformance.
Utopian belief:  Cheerfulness

There is no tradition of celibacy in any of the Diamonil faiths.  Indeed, one thing noted by the psychohistographers of Diamonil is that each path describes something that at least some gryphons believe in as a parenting ideal.
