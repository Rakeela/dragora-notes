#Rapture-Communities

Polis Diamonil developed a long and sometimes awful history.  It got too much to bear, and I hated leaving it in the grip of the Nationstates mechanics.  So I started creating "Nth Communities of the Xian Rapture", where X indicates a specified subset of the Diamonil avians which is intended to be reincarnated in the nation.

Specific rapture community pages:
[[First-Community-of-the-Zintrothian-Rapture]]
[[Second-Community-of-the-Zintrothian-Rapture]]
[[First-Community-of-the-Steelfeather-Rapture]]  (Current!)
