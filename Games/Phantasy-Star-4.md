#Phantasy-Star-4

This was my favorite game for a long time and I still love it.  However, I've played it through to completion twice and I've even trekked across the game world to see a bunch of optional content (like Molcrum being intact before you find Professor Holt).  There's not much more to the game that I haven't seen.  It's hard to go back again.  I've kinda played it to death.
