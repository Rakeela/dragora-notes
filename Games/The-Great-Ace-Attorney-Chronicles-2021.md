#The-Great-Ace-Attorney-Chronicles-2021

[[The-Great-Ace-Attorney-Chronicles-2021]] is squeaking into my [[Notable-Videogames]] list, mostly by having a standout example of Panarchic theming in Stronghart.  A repeated element of encounters with him is him making a grand gesture whereupon birds fly in his great clocktower office.  He's a hugely influential force proud to be running a grand symposium.  Why would these symbolic details line up?
