#First-Community-of-the-Steelfeather-Rapture

I hadn't originally intended to reincarnate the Steelfeathers this way.  They were somewhere between a biker gang and warrior poets.  They were also the largest faction in the bureaucracy of Old Diamonil and a potent minor faction in its police force, but they were still distinctly (albeit dutifully) anti-government.  Restrictions on the civil rights of the revered Steelfeathers were *the* precipitating event for the concluding reign of [[Tekazien-the-Scholar]] in the final days of Old Diamonil.  I brought the Steelfeathers back because they would be able to face down the chaos inherent in NationStates without getting rolled over like the Zintrothians did.

I hoped they would protect the Seekers of Zintroth.  They've since instead refounded *all* the [[Faiths-of-Diamonil]] in a reincarnationist mode.  They consider their nation to (still) be Diamonil, and they've named the capitol of the First Steelfeather Rapture Community "Litherusk" for good measure.  I've much to write with them.

"Deathmarks" - a unit of time tracked by the First Community of the Steelfeather Rapture.  The exact length of a Deathmark changes from year to year.  (In fact, they can only be accurately assigned in hindsight.)  The length of a deathmark is the length of time needed to recalculate the national death rate and enter it into the historic record.

In our time, each Deathmark corresponds to a stable 1 calendar day each.

The Steelfeathers are hyperliterate.  The bureaucracy's reports all get read by someone, and usually they were being both written and read by Steelfeathers.  The most legendary soul among them - the arguable God of the Steelfeathers - is [[Ziazien-the-Architect]], who was the single most influential psychohistographer in the history of Polis Diamonil... unless you count Teyzaw, who Ziazien in his own life believed was a fictional goddess that never existed as a historic person.

There were a *lot* of hyperliterate peacock gryphons in the fiction of Old Diamonil.  Politics in Old Diamonil were commonly shifted by the book market, whether that was obvious or not.  Such was the result of my fantasies where I tried to make 'a better world' out of the atrocious substance of NationStates...  Politics in the First Community of the Steelfeather Rapture are again shifted largely by the book market, and so a lot of events are signaled by the reused headline 'New Politics Book Circulating'.

(This space is likely to be given to a record of previously published books in the setting.)

Scratchspace for Future Books:
"The Scourging of the Flame" - Authored by Kavikeil, who is Ziazien reincarnated, this discloses the events of Deathmark 15, to be published on Deathmark 25, which is 9 days from now.
"Ziazien the Atheist" - Authored by a dissident accusing Kavikeil of fraudulently claiming to be Ziazien, this biography of Ziazien (accurately) claims that he was an atheist in Old Diamonil.  To be published on Deathmark 18, which is 2 days from now.
"Essentia and the Many False Myriads" - This book attempts to explore the nature of liberalism vs conservatism, and argues that 'different conservatisms' are inherently at odds with each other in a way that 'different liberalisms' are not.  Publish when ready.
