13:46.  I was starting to wonder if I would make any time points at all today.  I've been unproductive.  I haven't been able to think of my story until just now, and if I'm not thinking of my story, I'm not advancing as a writer.  31,869.

14:54.  32,777.  908 words of progress.

14:58.  Oops.  I accidentally shut off the treadmill.  Sort of.  I hit the pause button, but it didn't show the usual summary of the session.  It just went abruptly to its neutral screen.  I don't know exactly how long I've walked today, but I think it was four hours at 1.1 mph.

14:59.  Yeah, the treadmill crashed again.

15:00.  I am at a got-nothing point in my writing.  I wrote something that I think worked well, but I don't know what to write next.  At all.

15:11.  32,978.  1,109 words of progress.

15:30.  33,381.  Even though I've already messed up recording my daily treadmill usage, I'm restarting the treadmill.  It just feels unnatural to be at my computer and not walking.  I'm so used to the treadmill desk.

15:53.  33,809.  1,904 words of progress.  4,110 words on the chapter.

15:58.  33,864.  Chapter complete.  0 words on the chapter.

16:01.  33,885.  2,016 words of progress.  I'm at another got-nothing moment.
