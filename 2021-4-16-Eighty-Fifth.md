There is one character who I will never be able to put in my [[character-gallery]].  One who I feel I summoned rather than wrote with, one who I feel no ownership over.  That was "Marchosias".  I don't remember choosing the name with the intention of picking a Goetic demon.  I wanted a demon-sounding name.

I used to pick names for characters by sounding out nonsense strings until I decided something sounded euphonic.  Well, in recent years and indeed for quite some time, I have used Rinksworth, which deserves to be looked up for its name generator.  I don't make up character names unassisted anymore.

Marchosias was written for a setting I've no right to use and which I feel some pain in referencing.  She was born in promising circumstances within a terrifying land to parents with a highly unusual relationship.  It is very difficult to specify things about a character I feel I do not own; even dryly recounting my own prior intentions feels invasive.  I've some grief on those who interacted with her...  that's not making any of this easier to write, though I'm doing it regardless.  Her story turned out remarkable.

Relative to her origin in *a terrifying land*, Marchosias was unusually peaceful and ethical.  Relative to most of the setting, that left her a villain.

She wanted to find out... how people break.  For their own good, she might have said.  She wanted to put together structures.  To inspire thought, and reward those who would.  To find truth and share it, and reward those who would.  Yet she saw the world as a frangible noosphere, or so I found exploring her point of view.  She believed that everyone could be turned towards the weaknesses of their minds.

Her greatest pride was a soul-rending machine projecting an unknown hellscape that appeared as a plume of starkly bleaching white fire to outside observers, bleeding the color from the world and fading all to shades of black and white where its light fell.  Inside, past the bounds of the fortress at the base of the fire, the inside of the fortress was an almost unknowable nightmare realm, where Marchosias' and her servitrors pressured people to go for reasons of debt or devotion.

Entropic magic, applied to the mind and soul.  She was a demon.

The machine would try to evaluate souls and place them in circumstances that would twist them, generating custom hells for those who went into the machine.

Her soul engine automated Marchosias' fixation on the way personalities develop in response to stress.  It generated scenarios, recorded outcomes, dispensed rewards and punishments...  It was not good to be within that stark white flame for very long, and Marchosias knew she was ordering the torrment of people who incurred debts with her.  Yet the flame was not a pure punishment, as in moderate exposures, Marchosias hoped that she could strengthen those who trusted her enough to go into it willingly, leaving them wiser, more clever, and/or imbued with useful entropic magics of their own.

She enjoyed many of the people who left her soul engine as monsters, yet she didn't consider it a failure when some of the people who left her soul engine departed as withered ascetics.  She thought that was interesting.  Withered ascetics had often managed to touch the entropic energy of madness without going insane.  Some of them were grateful; a few chose to go back inside.  To the end of finding out what would be incorruptible in a soul, these ones who Marchosias found herself indebted to as they participated in her greatest experiment...  They were progress.  In the scenarios of the Soul Engine, their natures had withstood unexpected burdens.

In her thoughts, or at least as I thought when imagining her thoughts in overseeing this machine, Marchosias likened souls to materials.  This one was steel, and that one was tin; this one was lead, and that one was gold.  Finer than the metal souls were the gem souls, so she thought; these were the ones that she most wanted her Soul Engine to uncover.  When all the dross of lesser being had been cleansed from them, these were the souls who shined, revealing sources of unexpected beauty.  As she studied this spiritual alchemy, she tuned the engine for its transformative potential...

It powered magic in that world through her, or better said *she* powered magic in that world through *it*, because the Soul Engine could hold her attention indefinitely, along with the myriad minor heavens and near-hells which collected in her aura.  Studying the patterns of being in a world, she could survive becoming increasingly like an abstract principle of the universe.

The finest souls, whose existence Marchosias predicted yet could not find, were the ones that she called *diamond*, who she believed would be incorruptible.

In her setting, the kind of demon that Marchosias was held a mystic potency at *unbinding*.  How do you do anything against the will of one who *unbinds*?  Is there any snare that can still be put on such a person?

Well, nevermind that.  You know what's more like rape than anything Marchosias ever did in her whole life?  Mind-controlling a bunch of people to make them "loving".

In the strange social context that she found herself, I wonder why Marchosias might have wanted to create a soul who would be virtuous of their own will if they held an unlimited power to lift bindings from their mind, and who would still use that power virtuously while subject to the psychic pressure of a hostile god.

Fiction, you know.  Powerful stuff.

I later discovered that the Marchosias in mythology is a demon marquis.  To be a Marquis or Marchessa is to be a ruler of the contested bordermarches; in the context of a conflict between Heaven and Hell, that would be the spiritual region between Heaven and Hell.  Supposedly, she answers truthfully to any question, and though she leads demons in conflict against Heaven, she is among those who long for redemption.

I'm not really sure that I wish the people I was writing that story with had been a little more collaborative.  It was super-stressful to work with them, and it was a bad time that capped off a lot of bad times; it was the last experience I had in a place where I didn't feel safe, where people around me seemed very intent on treating me in a very demeaning way.  Yet it was also a crucible, as was the focus of Marchosias' story within it, and though her own soul was a great power only in the forces entropic, it was while interacting with those people that she became very intent on creating a soul better than her own.

Still, I felt really bad about how nobody save me seemed to understand the least bit about Marchosias' story.  I wish I could share it with my then-collaborators, sans the hatreds that tainted that environment.

When I said, "Well, nevermind that," I was skipping over an answer.  If someone could unbind *anything* upon themselves, what would they *never* unbind?  What bind is proof against unbinding?  There's only one, but it comes in nigh-infinite forms...  Love.

Should the forces paradisic stand against the law of love, who would not prefer to fall?
