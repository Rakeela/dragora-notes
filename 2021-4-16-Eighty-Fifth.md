There is one character who I will never be able to put in my [[character-gallery]].  One who I feel I summoned rather than wrote with, one who I feel no ownership over.  That was "Marchosias".  I don't remember choosing the name with the intention of picking a Goetic demon.  I wanted a demon-sounding name.

I used to pick names for characters by sounding out nonsense strings until I decided something sounded euphonic.  Well, in recent years and indeed for quite some time, I have used Rinksworth, which deserves to be looked up for its name generator.  I don't make up character names unassisted anymore.

Marchosias was written for a setting I've no right to use and which I feel some pain in referencing.  She was born in promising circumstances within a terrifying land to parents with a highly unusual relationship.  It is very difficult to specify things about a character I feel I do not own; even dryly recounting my own prior intentions feels invasive.  I've some grief on those who interacted with her...  that's not making any of this easier to write, though I'm doing it regardless.  Her story turned out remarkable.

Relative to her origins, Marchosias was unusually peaceful and ethical.  Relative to most of the setting, that left her a villain.  She was born somewhere with customs of recreational torture where being nice to people involved merely torturing them less.  She was a nice person by the standards of her homeland.

She wanted to find out... how people break.  For their own good, she might have said.  She wanted to put together structures.  To inspire thought, and reward those who would.  To find truth and share it, and reward those who would.  Yet she saw the world as a frangible noosphere, or so I found exploring her point of view.  She believed that everyone could be turned towards the weaknesses of their minds.

Her greatest pride was a soul-rending machine projecting an unknown hellscape that appeared as a plume of starkly bleaching white fire to outside observers, bleeding the color from the world and fading all to shades of black and white where its light fell.  Inside, past the bounds of the fortress at the base of the fire, the inside of the fortress was an almost unknowable nightmare realm, where Marchosias' and her servitrors pressured people to go for reasons of debt or devotion.

Entropic magic, applied to the mind and soul.  She was a demon.

The machine would try to evaluate souls and place them in circumstances that would twist them, generating custom hells for those who went into the machine.

Her soul engine automated Marchosias' fixation on the way personalities develop in response to stress.  It generated scenarios, recorded outcomes, dispensed rewards and punishments...  It was not good to be within that stark white flame for very long, and Marchosias knew she was ordering the torrment of people who incurred debts with her.  Yet the flame was not a pure punishment, as in moderate exposures, Marchosias hoped that she could strengthen those who trusted her enough to go into it willingly, leaving them wiser, more clever, and/or imbued with useful entropic magics of their own.

She enjoyed many of the people who left her soul engine as monsters, yet she didn't consider it a failure when some of the people who left her soul engine departed as withered ascetics.  She thought that was interesting.  Withered ascetics had often managed to touch the entropic energy of madness without going insane.  Some of them were grateful; a few chose to go back inside.  To the end of finding out what would be incorruptible in a soul, these ones who Marchosias found herself indebted to as they participated in her greatest experiment...  They were progress.  In the scenarios of the Soul Engine, their natures had withstood unexpected burdens.

In her thoughts, or at least as I thought when imagining her thoughts in overseeing this machine, Marchosias likened souls to materials.  This one was steel, and that one was tin; this one was lead, and that one was gold.  Finer than the metal souls were the gem souls, so she thought; these were the ones that she most wanted her Soul Engine to uncover.  When all the dross of lesser being had been cleansed from them, these were the souls who shined, revealing sources of unexpected beauty.  As she studied this spiritual alchemy, she tuned the engine for its transformative potential...

It powered magic in that world through her, or better said *she* powered magic in that world through *it*, because the Soul Engine could hold her attention indefinitely, along with the myriad minor heavens and near-hells which collected in her aura.  Studying the patterns of being in a world, she could survive becoming increasingly like an abstract principle of the universe.

The finest souls, whose existence Marchosias predicted yet could not find, were the ones that she called *diamond*, who she believed would be incorruptible.
