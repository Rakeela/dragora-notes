0:40.  I have set my personal caffeination record since I woke up yesterday, and it has been *intensely* pleasurable.

0:47.  I tormented Kistaro yesterday with my bad gas, brought on by my consumption of sugar alcohols and beans.  I also worked for hour after hour after hour on a project.  Oh my god, I wish I could work like that every day.  I felt so good.  I never felt tired or burned out.  I didn't always flow, but I rarely felt stumped.  My digestion couldn't stop yesterday from being amazing.

0:48.  What I worked on yesterday from morning into the evening was a module for Hc Svnt Dracones.  I have written an entire module from scratch and I have written a good portion of a second module.  I did this with the advice - but NO PROSE ASSISTANCE - from an AI program called Bard, which is offered by Google.  I just kept firing questions at it in an attempt to remain inspired.

14:06.  I slept past 12:30, and haven't been productive yet.  I have been studying Hc Svnt Dracones a bit more at least.

19:06.  I have been hallucinating social media notification sounds.

19:13.  If I'm going to be hallucinating, I'm going to punish my voices by eating sweets.  Take that!
