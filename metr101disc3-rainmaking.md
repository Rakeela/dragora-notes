# Metr101disc3 Rainmaking

The answer to whether or not we can make it rain depends on the timescales in question.  On any given day, we cannot create a certainty of rain.  Cloudseeding techniques exist to try to generate short-term alterations in rain patterns[], but even they only bias the odds.  Given the countless chaotic interactions of the air molecules, I doubt any technology save some absurd investment in pumping water could ever cause rain to occur on schedule.  Yet I would argue that does not mean we cannot make it rain.

Over timescales of at least three decades, humans can dramatically alter the odds of rainfall in a given region.  This can happen not only deleteriously in side effects to bad ecological management, but it can also happen intentionally in sought effects of good ecological management.  I would hold up the American Midwest as the foremost example of this kind of alteration, although China's government is also currently attempting to push back desertification with techniques derived from the study of America's midwestern ecological management[].  America almost lost its farmlands to desertification[].  Until our government stepped in to plant all those rows of windbreak trees, life-giving rural rainstorms had begun to be replaced with useless rural duststorms.  The soil was being stripped away and blown off to parts unknown where it did no good for anyone.  By interceding, the rains were brought back, and thus when viewed over the correct span of time it's clear that America's government is among the human organizations that can be credited with rainmaking.

Planting trees doesn't contribute to this cause only by catching dust from the air[].  Trees also draw up water from the water table and transpire it into the air[].  The trees exhale water from the ground.  As well, the roots of the trees break up the soil, moderating its water retention properties by holding loose soils that hold water poorly[] and splitting dense soils that water struggles to infiltrate[].  In mature ecosystems, trees eventually fall and decompose, providing new soil with good qualities[] as well as habitat for fungi whose spores promote clean, abundant cloud formation[].  Well-tended forests are thus one of the tools by which we can cause rain to fall.  They do not let us choose the precise time or place where the rain falls, but our scientists have studied the implications of the forests.  It is no longer a mystery why deforested places develop dry and windy climes[], nor are we powerless to run that process to our gain with deliberate afforestation[].

I need citations.  Right now it's a recitation of my beliefs about causality.  I'm going to go put [] in the essay which propose potentially citable lines.
