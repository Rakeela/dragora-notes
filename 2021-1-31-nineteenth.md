I had a peculiar thought this dark night that I wanted to record.  I think my interest in touch would increase if I could see a visualization of the key nerve networks of the body, with a visualization of their positive response to touch.  As a still image, this would be minimal; as an interactive image, only slightly better.  Yet what I was really visualizing as something that would make physical touch comprehensible to me was an augmented-reality style interface...  A high-tech tactility toy for people to learn about each others' bodies with.  Is that too technophilic of me?

I shy to describe the thought any further; I feel I would mar it more than strengthen it, if I rush in to speak every thought I have of it.  Yet this link which motivated these thoughts I do wish to share: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/24/lost-touch-how-a-year-without-hugs-affects-our-mental-health

I'm not a very tactile person.  I may literally have been raised poorly for lack of hugs.  More hugs from my father than my mother, then my father's mother in third place...  A very few from more distant relatives...  Nobody else ever.  The idea of being physically safe in that much proximity to people was difficult for me to understand until my husband had hugged on me enough in adult life.  When I first moved out here, I was occasionally shaken by being hugged.  Trying to learn a slow thaw and an appreciation of touch has been a slow work of years.  My SO has talked about the idea of us being furred dragons someday, as part of our discussions of a private fictional setting we're both privileged to be acquainted with, for in that setting the furred dragons are prone to touch-starvation.  I have no great opposition to the concept; I would say that I have two forms that feel true and yet both of them are shapeshifters!  Yet for personal psychology reasons, seeing the trajectory that I have gone across in my response to touch in the years that I've lived in Redmond, I think the touch-starved furred dragon would not be the first dragon form I would seek to technologically transform myself into.  I have further yet to warm before I can be fluffy.

There's some talk of anatomy in this piece.  It's interesting.  It encouraged the thought of the technophilic touch-encourager.  I can't quite bring myself to file it into the medical news archive, and so my curation of news-by-topics has already found its first flummoxation.  What kind of news is this?  Am I improperly removing it from medical news?  Are there several kinds of medical news which I need to separate from each other in my archive for me to be satisfied with the archive's ability to meet my needs?

Also on the thought of organization, one of my topics is clearly 'per date' posts.  I should tie all these up and link them into a shared structure.  I'm not going to commit to the task, but I doubt this is the last time I'll think it would be useful to have such a navigable structure.

I wonder if studying wind patterns could be utilized to create a resort that is favored to receive warm winds.  I don't know why, but that thought strikes me as somehow romantic.  A wind you don't want to hide from, a more uplifting kind of breeze... as long as it isn't just pouring off a baking desert, I suppose.  Hm.  It'd be difficult.  I love the sound of the phrase "katabatic wind", but unfortunately it means a downslope wind, which is usually cold.  Running across that phrase while studying lead me to wonder if a reliable upslope wind would be typically warm.  Of course, if it was also tending to be moist, rising up the slope would precipitate it; you would get a mountain prone to rain and fog.  As a fan of rain, maybe someday I should see if there are conditions where the math indicates pleasant environs.
