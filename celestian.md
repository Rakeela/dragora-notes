# Celestian

The Celestians are presented as purity and light, but what do their low-level soldiers use?  Their fists.  What do their high-level soldiers use?  Madness and mind control.  What is their landscape disaster?  The Veil of Tranquility, which makes people "happier", while inflicting a 20% penalty to research and making everyone more vulnerable to celestians.  Five veils of tranquility will paralyze the research output of a colony in exchange for +30 happiness per turn.  The Veil of Tranquility appears to be a miles-high flaming beacon above a large meteor impact crater.  The Celestian Doomsday device is described as controlling the entire planet with psionically-enforced Truth.

I think the Celestians
