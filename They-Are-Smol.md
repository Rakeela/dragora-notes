#They-Are-Smol

This is an online series, but I'll classify it as a book for purposes of the Bibliography. The archive can be found here:

As of first upload, I've read Arcs 1 and 2.

This book is ugly alien fiction to me.  I don't like the culture it references, but I can tell it hits a reference pool obsessively.  It constantly cracks jokes that are meant to be shared, too.

Despite calling the book ugly, I wish I could meet two out of the three alien species it describes.  This is very optimistic sci-fi.  It's very much about technology winning and doing good in the long-term.  Utopian, although it's utopia with difficulties in setup and translation.
