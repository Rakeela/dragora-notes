#They-Are-Smol

This is an online series, but I'll classify it as a book for purposes of the Bibliography. The archive can be found here:

As of first upload, I've read Arcs 1 and 2.

This book is ugly alien fiction to me.  I don't like the culture it references, but I can tell it hits a reference pool obsessively.  It constantly cracks jokes that are meant to be shared, too.

Despite calling the book ugly, I wish I could meet two out of the three alien species it describes.  This is very optimistic sci-fi.  It's very much about technology winning and doing good in the long-term.  Utopian, although it's utopia with difficulties in setup and translation.

This book treats people as having no capability of controlling population growth in a technologically advanced society.  It's ugly.  This is like anti-technologist propaganda.  We still need to deal with overpopulation if we get life extension working.  People with longer lifespans and more mature attitudes should have an easier time understanding why NOT to have babies.  Massive wealth should help slow population growth; look at population growth on Earth and you'll see it's heavily centered on impoverished, miserable communities.

Add this to the way They Are Smol pushes the nonsensical "first contact would cause riots" angle, and you have something that seems like it wouldn't describe humanity very well.  Seriously, the #1 response to first contact would be apathetic continuity of life, and the #1 non-apathetic response would be aggressive disbelief which would annoy people who care yet tend to stabiliize things further.
