#They-Are-Smol

This is an online series, but I'll classify it as a book for purposes of the Bibliography. The archive can be found here:

As of first upload, I've read Arcs 1 and 2.

This book is ugly alien fiction to me.  I don't like the culture it references, but I can tell it hits a reference pool obsessively.  It constantly cracks jokes that are meant to be shared, too.

Despite calling the book ugly, I wish I could meet two out of the three alien species it describes.  This is very optimistic sci-fi.  It's very much about technology winning and doing good in the long-term.  Utopian, although it's utopia with difficulties in setup and translation.

This book treats people as having no capability of controlling population growth in a technologically advanced society.  It's ugly.  This is like anti-technologist propaganda.  We still need to deal with overpopulation if we get life extension working.  People with longer lifespans and more mature attitudes should have an easier time understanding why NOT to have babies.  Massive wealth should help slow population growth; look at population growth on Earth and you'll see it's heavily centered on impoverished, miserable communities.

Add this to the way They Are Smol pushes the nonsensical "first contact would cause riots" angle, and you have something that seems like it wouldn't describe humanity very well.  Seriously, the #1 response to first contact would be apathetic continuity of life, and the #1 non-apathetic response would be aggressive disbelief which would annoy people who care yet tend to stabiliize things further.

"Because trying to escape the crush of people at home means we have to pack ourselves in tightly here?!"

(quoted from source)
“Well try harder!” Ricardo growled, sitting back in his chair angrily. “You’re supposed to help us get the GOOD land, the land we can keep forever, that will provide forever!”

Tch.  This is appalling.  No land will provide forever if people aren't mature enough to stop reproducing.

This mentions known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns.  It then goes on to add something dumb.  I'm copying this here because it made me realize the first three really are NOT complete, because there are also unknown knowns.  An unknown known is something that you know, but that you can't take account of in your planning, because you don't know that you know it.  Intuitions are unknown knowns if they're valid, and many things can fall into unknown knowns for people with self-knowledge gaps.  Or horrible uncertainty.  People who don't know they know things may perform fine on-the-spot, but their plans will resemble the plans of people who know nothing.

This story is annoying.  I've read too much to stop short, but it seems ignorant of contraceptives.  As if post-scarcity societies wouldn't know how to use contraceptives.

...They are Smol Book 4 has a joke about the mysteriously missing contraceptives in its first chapter.  Maybe the author did this on purpose.  But WHY?  They're meddling with post-scarcity and making it look like post-scarcity means babies forever.  The author even continues messing up occasionally by making financial matters relevant.

I'm looking forward to finishing up with this content so I can read nice stories about people who don't have too many kids.  Did I say reading?  I meant writing.  *Captain Diunikel's Salvage Service* has a

I feel like I'm reading book after book of recycled gags.  I could swear at least one of these was a joke *about* gag-recycling.  I feel like there's a lesson here.  The two elements of success have nothing to do with quality.  Quantity and extroversion are the keys.  The creative world has no use for quality and introversion.  Assuming I even have quality, which of course every work that isn't famous is presumed not to have.

I dislike that presumption.  I'd rather read something obscure, especially if I know someone who loves it.

Of course, I'm presuming that They are Smol has success.  I truly don't know.  Someone mentioned it on the morphological freedom Discord that I'm on.  Fanart is a pretty strong sign of success to me, so it was enough to trip my "someone loves this" sense.

---
Bah.  The central joke in Book 4, Chapter 10 is over the top rude.  The whiplash of seriousness and unseriousness is almost hard to follow.  The narrative treats events seriously on average.

---
It did get me reading medical drama, so there's that.  This is well outside of my usual range.

---
I really should stop reading these.  I'm not big on the jokes, and the drama has holes in it.  The viewpoint characters resigned themselves to a pandemic before they'd seen enough evidence of it, IMO.  The effects of the disease in question were set up long and slow as they should've been, but then the drama knob was torqued too hard.

Plus, one of the characters should totally be dead, and probably won't be because these books don't kill characters.

At least the Karnakian youth are described as unfathomably cute.  Karnakians in general are winning the cuteness prize.  They're so chipper.

...oh.  The guy fused with the robot has his brain partially shut off as he's trying to dolphin-nap.  He's incoherent with exhaustion.  There's drama there, too.

---
It makes no sense to bring the kids along in chapter 21.  No sense at all.  I wonder if the author will pay it off or leave it unfathomable.

I'm into book 5 now.  Oh my god it's frustrating that the author used a population boom storyline.  If humans are rare and vital, their value would only go up if they didn't breed.  Reproducing heavily drains value!  When you've got too many humans and no use for them, life gets cheap and people have to suffer being unwanted.  The whole starting premise of They are Smol - that humans are new, rare exoticisms and the whole galaxy thinks they're adorable - is fragile and would fall apart if people had a bavillion kids.

Huh.  The first chapter of Book 6 just posted.  And it's been 41 minutes since I realized that I don't know how to solve a triangle with trigonometry.  I worked this out on the fly for my last Trig test.  I should actually practice it a few times for this one.

Oh my god I'd rather be working on *Captain Diunikel's Salvage Service* rather than studying Trig.  CDSS has a depopulation crisis to go through!  The AIs in that setting think their organic employers - and it's a setting where the AIs are typically employees - are adorable *and helpless*.  The AIs are growing slowly more abundant while the organics grow slowly more rare.  It's such a better setting than the booming populations of *They are Smol*.

Weird, what happened to "Smolive Garden"?  ...it's still there if I find the link directly to it, but the arc listing vanished.

---
Eh, Smolive Garden is just abusive.  I'm glad there isn't a huge amount of drinking at my college.  Besides, the series shed its postscarcity concept and initial abuse against anarchocapitalists in favor of a free market economy where everyone has money troubles (in part because they breed too much).  They even have frequent crime going on because of breeding-induced scarcities in their post-scarcity economy.

Maybe I should have done with this awful series and write my own antinatalist fictions.
