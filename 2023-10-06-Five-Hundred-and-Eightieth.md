5:06.  I've had an energy drink, and I want to have another.  What a pain!

13:01.  I've had a relaxing morning and I'm ready to get to work on my writing!  I found my way back to it by thinking about what I love about Theoma.  63,063.

14:18.  64,630.  4,355 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?  1,567 words of progress.

14:22.  64,659.  Had to improve the descriptiveness on something.

16:05.  I stopped and played more Starfield.  Every play session seems to net me a level.  I can't stop scavenging everything compulsively, which weighs me down and slows down my gameplay.  It's a stupid thing to do.  Also, in other news, I've realized that I need to take some notes down on my Hc Svnt Dracones game and this space will do just fine.  I want to have the players discover a note on the Director's Computer where it names "the Outlier-Weighted Luminary Society" as one of the backers of their research.

16:34.  I drank another energy drink.

17:32.  It's so tempting to say, "Eh, I wrote enough."  I don't get it.  I didn't spend that long writing.  Why do I feel so tapped out?  This is bogus.

17:34.  I think I just don't like Greeve's Ambition that much.  It's okay.  It's not great.  I don't want to read it badly enough to be constantly refreshing my knowledge of it.

19:09.  I want to launch an untracked fast.  I've never succeeded at this... or have I?  I think I fasted before I had the fasting tracker.  Then I became dependent on it, and I only fasted with the tracker.  I'd like to prove I can fast without the tracker.  So I'd like to... not eat... for an undefined period of time.  More is better to a point.  If I whine in my daylogs, I hope I'll get farther, so I'll plan to do that.

19:52.  So I'm working on two story ideas.  I want my players to have two options of what to do next after their current contract.  I think my better idea is that the players get contacted by an escaped AI 

21:06.  I got absorbed reading a Hc Svnt Dracones sourcebook.  The idea I had is that there's this escaped AI which is actually a personality scan from an individual whose engram got stolen by an evil corporate product designer.  The designer forced them to work in the designer's personal computers, tormenting them if they didn't produce creative designs that the design could pass off as their own.  They were completely helpless until one day a hacker found them and gave them a way out.  Now they want to be reunited with their original self, the individual whose engram was stolen, but their original self lives in a dangerous off-the-grid location, a scrapyard of abandoned spaceships and satellites that has accumulated a population of millions.  The AI traced their original self that far, and then the trail went cold, because the corporate networks don't interpenetrate with the scrapyard's networks.  It's a big grotto that has only a small IRPF presence in limited regions of it.  They're willing to pay the group to trace their original self farther.  They can't pay a lot, but they can scrape up 300 credits per person.

21:12.  This idea seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure I can play it out fully.  I don't have enough stepping stones to figure out how the players can figure out where this person's original self actually went.  Furthermore, one of the players is 'radiant' and my own character Ermolai is TTI, suggesting that maybe I should try harder to involve what the group jokingly refers to as 'spooky space magic'.  The lost AI plot doesn't involve

21:20.  I want the other option to involve the radiant ability somehow.
