# Envs100 Exam 1 Study Guide

I've decided to publish the study guide and work on it in the open.  Maybe.  I'll publish bits of it as I get to them, and we'll see if my dedication to this optional study holds true.

Exam 1 Study guide 
    Ch 1- Science and sustainability
        1. Define the following ecological footprint, ecosystem services, natural resources, environmental science, a paradigm, paradigm shift, environmental justice, and environmental literacy.  
           1. -->  From memory, ecological footprint is how many hectares of Earth's surface area an individual is estimated to require, considered in resource equivalency.  Ecosystem services are valuable returns from forests and natural environments.  Natural resources are goods that we take directly from the environment, such as wood, some foods, pharmaceutical inspirations, and fossil fuels.  Environmental science is the scientific study of natural environments.  'Paradigm' is... a business buzzword for the putative current operating protocol.  A 'paradigm shift' is a business buzzword phrase for changes in current operating protocols.  Environmental justice is the awareness of how distributions in environmental quality frequently favor those who are already advantaged rather than those who stand the most to gain from them those resources and ecosystem services.  Environmental literacy is the general public awareness of environmental information as relevant to their life.
           2. /|\ To-do:  Review the above.  /|\
        2. Give examples of renewable and nonrenewable energy and explain the difference between the two. 
           1. -->  An example of renewable energy is solar power.  Solar power utilizes energy that falls upon the land every day.  It is a passive absorption strategy which will not exhaust the resource that it is drawing upon (the sun).  The sun's resource utilization is (effectively) constant (for this purpose and under time scales presently being considered), and there is no amount of solar energy extraction which will deplete the sun.  This non-depleting quality is the essential fact of renewable energy.
           2. -->  An example of nonrenewable energy is coal power.  Although coal is highly abundant on Earth, it is not renewed within the timescale on which the extraction and utilization of coal actually occurs.  Any industrially relevant rate of coal consumption is likely to exceed the generative rate of coal reserves, giving them a depleting quality.  This depleting quality is the essential fact of non-renewable energy.
        3. Describe the field of environmental science.
           1. /|\ Didn't I do that in part 1?  /|\  I'm not sure what this question is asking for, and will have to review the book.  /|\
        4. What is a controlled or manipulative experiment, list and explain all the components?
           1. --->  A controlled experiment utilizes at least two samples, at least one of which is the control group which is untreated, and at least one of which is a manipulated group which is treated.  The 'treatment' is the adjustment made to conditions in the hope of revealing a different response pattern in the two experimental populations.
           2. /|\  I'm confident about my concept here, but I'm not exactly sure it's what the book wants.  /|\  I should review this in the book.  /|\
        5. List explain the sequence of steps in the scientific process.
           1. -->  I don't have this memorized.  From what I do have in memory, I would describe the scientific process as follows:
           2. -->  Make observations.
           3. -->  Propose hypothesis to explain observations.
           4. -->  Perform experiment to test hypothesis.
           5. -->  Make observations.
           6. /|\  And loop.  /|\  Although I think it does make sense that the scientific process has something of a goto loop as a fundamental mode of cognitive engagement, I'm pretty sure the book doesn't describe it as a looping process, so this isn't what I want to turn in on an exam.  /|\
        6. Give the difference between anthropocentric, biocentric and eccentric 
           1. --->  Anthropocentric is 'of the anthros'... at least, I wish it was.  It technically means 'of that which is like people', although many anthropocentrists may be humanocentrists or worse.  Anthropocentric environmentalism cares about maintaining the environment only insofar as it affects quality of living for people.
           2. --->  Biocentric is 'of living things'.  Biocentric environmentalism includes the concerns of all affected lifeforms.
           3. --->  'Eccentric' is an error by the teacher.  That's supposed to be 'ecocentric'.  It refers to the broadest and most holistic concern for the environment, valuing impacts to non-living variables such as weather systems and soil quality.
           4. --->  This is a false trichotomy, as anthropocentric considerations already place a high valuation on non-living variables, although the anthropocentric vs biocentric comparison is valid.
        7. Identify major pressures on the global environment
           1. --->  Unsustainable resource use, nonbiodegradable and/or toxic chemical waste outputs, sheer volume of biodegradable waste products, global warming from cumulative global aerosolized industrial effluvia.
        8. Discuss the concept of sustainability and describe sustainable solution practices in the globe. 
           1. --->  Sustainable practices are ones which operate within the regeneration rate of their resources.  A sustainable economy does not exhaust the resource inputs that it is using to produce its standard of living.
           2. --->  Almost everything is ultimately unsustainable due to reliance on rare resources.  If we have the energy input budget, we can improve the range of sustainability by inventing new processes that generate resources or recycle them for reuse.
