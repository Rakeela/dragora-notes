# Notes on Potential Applicability of RNA Vaccination to Treatment of Schizophrenia

While researching RNA vaccination for authoring [[envs100disc4-pandemicblues]], I tripped on some indications that RNA vaccination may have applicability to the treatment of arthritis, such as this: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20435931/ (Zheng X.  Suzuki, M.  Ichim, TE.  Zhang, X.  Sun, H.  Zhu, F.  Shunnar, A.  Garcia, B.  Inman, RD.  Min, W.  (2010, Jun 1)  Treatment of autoimmune arthritis using RNA interference-modulated dendritic cells.  *Journal of Immunology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-4.  Be warned that I haven't read it closely yet).  I didn't immediately make this notes archive at the time that I started plotting to potentially author this essay, and unfortunately I don't recall what made me think of looking for a potential treatment target in schizophrenia using RNA vaccination techniques.  (I think I may've been trying to find ways to better extend medical care in a fully enabling form to more of the most detested people in society.)  Yet when the thought recurred to me sans its inspiration, I did recall that schizophrenia is potentially a neuroinflammatory disorder.  Inflammatory functions are a very major component of pathogenesis in arthritis.  Could there be a similar antibody problem as occurs in arthritis, and furthermore could RNA vaccination hold the key to resolving such antibody problems in the general case?  If so, then RNA vaccination could be a technology yielding new special case antipsychotics with exceptionally adaptive qualities... indeed, it could hold the potential for an outright general cure.  I ought to investigate it, and this file shall for assembling my investigation, with ideally the production of a densely-cited essay in the output of my work.

Looking at this proposal to use RNA manipulation to vaccinate against collagen autoimmunity, it talks about knocking down CD40, CD80, and CD86.  CD40 is Cluster of Differentiation 40, a costimulatory protein found on antigen-presenting cells.  The clusters of differentiation are designated cell surface molecules providing targets for immunophenotyping cells.  Immunophenotyping is a technique used to study the protein expressed by cells.  It involves using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies to probe and stain target cells, thereby phenotyping the different cells in a heterogenous sample.  I am not sure what was meant by "knocking down" those three target clusters of differentiation.

Fortunately, Unpaywall to the rescue...  voila.  I have research I wouldn't ordinarily be able to access, and I can see what might be hiding behind the verbiage of the abstract.

It looks like "knocking down" a cluster of differentiation is a common term found in many papers which refers to inhibiting its expression on the surface of cells.  This ranges from full inhibition (knocked down CD no longer found on cells) to partial inhibition (incidence rate of knocked down CD reduced).  I'm very concerned that knocking down autoantigen reactive sites might also result in disease susceptibility through lost reactivity with actual pathogens, but that concern doesn't have to stop me from assembling relevant research information to establish the potential feasibility of a new treatment method.

This is interesting as a general review of the concept of autoantibodies to synaptic receptors as a cause of autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system.  It doesn't help me attest to schizophrenia as having a fundamentally autoimmune-mediated cause, which is a current research objective of mine for this essay.  I would like to be able to state directly in my draft why that is or is not the case, with at least one nice little [] by it to indicate my sincerity with a strong relevant link.

This looks like someone thinking in a similar vein to what I was thinking, without having access to prospective new technologies for attacking this novel treatment target.  This is the kind of thing I was looking for.

I need to establish a necessary connection between antigen treatment and RNA vaccination.  I don't fully understand this process yet.  It should shape my searching, and supports reading more about the potential applicability of RNA vaccination to allergies and arthritis.  I'm reading something that I believe I've cited before for other work.

https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/797421/ (Hattinger, E.  Scheiblhofer, S.  Roesler, E.  Thalhamer, T.  Thalhamer, J.  Weiss, R.  (2015, Oct 18)  Prophylactic mRNA Vaccination against Allergy Confers Long-Term Memory Responses and Persistent Protection in Mice.  *Journal of Immunology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-5.)

I hope that I'll be able to demonstrate shared action between this anti-allergen process and anti-arthritis interventions using RNA, thereby demonstrating extensibility across antigen-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases as well.

(Quoted from source)
"The induction of regulatory T cells has been shown to play an important role in keeping or restoring a nonallergic balanced status of the immune system against allergens [26]. However, in our model no significant differences in IL-10 expression could be detected between prevaccinated and control groups indicating no crucial role of IL-10-secreting Treg cells (Tr1) in the mechanisms underlying protection from an allergic immune response by mRNA immunization (Figure 2(f))."

(Quoted from source)
"Furthermore, recruitment of eosinophils to the lung was significantly reduced in the vaccination groups. Interestingly, the percentage of infiltrating neutrophils in the lung was increased in the vaccinated group during the acute phase of the lung response (Figure 3(f)). Similarly, Duechs et al. observed that application of various TLR agonists in an asthma model reduced airway eosinophilia and airway resistance but at the same time increased neutrophil influx [27]."

I read this to mean that this intervention works by shifting allergic response from immune response by eosinophils to immune response by neutrophils.  Eosinophils are most optimal against parasites, important against some infections, have a limited ability to phagocytose pathogens, are critical to pathogen presentation, and are essential immune response regulating cells.  Neutrophils are a much more appropriate responses to allergenic particles than eosinophils, as the neutrophils themselves will attempt to dismantle and ingest the allergenic particles, whereas the eosinophils will at best martial an immune response that summons neutrophils to ingest the allergenic particles.  That a similar shift from local eosinophilia to local neutrophilia could be productive for other classifications of immunoresponse tweaking is something that I'll need to establish, though from a quick review of available information on granulocytes (ie, I'm reading Wikipedia) I get the impression that eosinophils are the most autotoxic of the white blood cells with many forms of inappropriate activation.  That's promising.

This is notable mostly as a speedbump.  It suggests that schizophrenics already have a shift in the balance of their immune system towards neutrophils and way from lymphocytes.  While this proves nothing immediately relevant to my research and doesn't suggest I should stop looking at this avenue, it is bad news in an intuitive base rates sense.  If increasing neutrophil activation is already occurring and it's not helping, the likelihood that a different kind of increased neutrophil activation will be helpful is rational to reduce, though not eliminate, at this juncture.

(2008, Apr)  Increased serum levels of CCL11/eotaxin in schizophrenia.  *Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry*.  Retrieved 2021-2-5.)

CCL11 is specifically a biomarker of eosinophils.  This suggests excess eosinophil activation is present in schizophrenics.  Other CCLs monitored in this study (CCL2, CCL3, CCL24, CXCL9, and CXCL10) are biomarkers of other kinds of immune cell or immune cell signalling compound, save for CCL24, which is another biomarker of eosinophil, which as an immune system signal attempts to recruit T lymphocytes and neutrophils.  CCL11 is notable for have a chemotactic effect on eosinophils, in other words, it recruits them.  This suggests that a specific malfunction occuring in schizophrenia may be eosinophils inappropriately recruiting each other to congregate around bits of nerve tissue for which their presence is rather unhealthy...

What is my vaccination target?  What am I proposing to teach the immune system cells to DO?  I see likenesses between these procedures which suggest that there is something here, but I can't succinctly specify a molecule.
