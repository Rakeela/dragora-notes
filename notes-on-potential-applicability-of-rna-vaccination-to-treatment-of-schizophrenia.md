# Notes on Potential Applicability of RNA Vaccination to Treatment of Schizophrenia

While researching RNA vaccination for authoring [[envs100disc4-pandemicblues]], I tripped on some indications that RNA vaccination may have applicability to the treatment of arthritis, such as this: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20435931/ (Zheng X.  Suzuki, M.  Ichim, TE.  Zhang, X.  Sun, H.  Zhu, F.  Shunnar, A.  Garcia, B.  Inman, RD.  Min, W.  (2010, Jun 1)  Treatment of autoimmune arthritis using RNA interference-modulated dendritic cells.  *Journal of Immunology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-4.  Be warned that I haven't read it closely yet).  I didn't immediately make this notes archive at the time that I started plotting to potentially author this essay, and unfortunately I don't recall what made me think of looking for a potential treatment target in schizophrenia using RNA vaccination techniques.  (I think I may've been trying to find ways to better extend medical care in a fully enabling form to more of the most detested people in society.)  Yet when the thought recurred to me sans its inspiration, I did recall that schizophrenia is potentially a neuroinflammatory disorder.  Inflammatory functions are a very major component of pathogenesis in arthritis.  Could there be a similar antibody problem as occurs in arthritis, and furthermore could RNA vaccination hold the key to resolving such antibody problems in the general case?  If so, then RNA vaccination could be a technology yielding new special case antipsychotics with exceptionally adaptive qualities... indeed, it could hold the potential for an outright general cure.  I ought to investigate it, and this file shall for assembling my investigation, with ideally the production of a densely-cited essay in the output of my work.

Looking at this proposal to use RNA manipulation to vaccinate against collagen autoimmunity, it talks about knocking down CD40, CD80, and CD86.  CD40 is Cluster of Differentiation 40, a costimulatory protein found on antigen-presenting cells.  The clusters of differentiation are designated cell surface molecules providing targets for immunophenotyping cells.  Immunophenotyping is a technique used to study the protein expressed by cells.  It involves using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies to probe and stain target cells, thereby phenotyping the different cells in a heterogenous sample.  I am not sure what was meant by "knocking down" those three target clusters of differentiation.

Fortunately, Unpaywall to the rescue...  voila.  I have research I wouldn't ordinarily be able to access, and I can see what might be hiding behind the verbiage of the abstract.

It looks like "knocking down" a cluster of differentiation is a common term found in many papers which refers to inhibiting its expression on the surface of cells.  This ranges from full inhibition (knocked down CD no longer found on cells) to partial inhibition (incidence rate of knocked down CD reduced).  I'm very concerned that knocking down autoantigen reactive sites might also result in disease susceptibility through lost reactivity with actual pathogens, but that concern doesn't have to stop me from assembling relevant research information to establish the potential feasibility of a new treatment method.

This is interesting as a general review of the concept of autoantibodies to synaptic receptors as a cause of autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system.  It doesn't help me attest to schizophrenia as having a fundamentally autoimmune-mediated cause, which is a current research objective of mine for this essay.  I would like to be able to state directly in my draft why that is or is not the case, with at least one nice little [] by it to indicate my sincerity with a strong relevant link.

This looks like someone thinking in a similar vein to what I was thinking, without having access to prospective new technologies for attacking this novel treatment target.  This is the kind of thing I was looking for.

I need to establish a necessary connection between antigen treatment and RNA vaccination.  I don't fully understand this process yet.  It should shape my searching, and supports reading more about the potential applicability of RNA vaccination to allergies and arthritis.  I'm reading something that I believe I've cited before for other work.

https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2015/797421/ (Hattinger, E.  Scheiblhofer, S.  Roesler, E.  Thalhamer, T.  Thalhamer, J.  Weiss, R.  (2015, Oct 18)  Prophylactic mRNA Vaccination against Allergy Confers Long-Term Memory Responses and Persistent Protection in Mice.  *Journal of Immunology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-5.)

I hope that I'll be able to demonstrate shared action between this anti-allergen process and anti-arthritis interventions using RNA, thereby demonstrating extensibility across antigen-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases as well.

(Quoted from source)
"The induction of regulatory T cells has been shown to play an important role in keeping or restoring a nonallergic balanced status of the immune system against allergens [26]. However, in our model no significant differences in IL-10 expression could be detected between prevaccinated and control groups indicating no crucial role of IL-10-secreting Treg cells (Tr1) in the mechanisms underlying protection from an allergic immune response by mRNA immunization (Figure 2(f))."

(Quoted from source)
"Furthermore, recruitment of eosinophils to the lung was significantly reduced in the vaccination groups. Interestingly, the percentage of infiltrating neutrophils in the lung was increased in the vaccinated group during the acute phase of the lung response (Figure 3(f)). Similarly, Duechs et al. observed that application of various TLR agonists in an asthma model reduced airway eosinophilia and airway resistance but at the same time increased neutrophil influx [27]."

I read this to mean that this intervention works by shifting allergic response from immune response by eosinophils to immune response by neutrophils.  Eosinophils are most optimal against parasites, important against some infections, have a limited ability to phagocytose pathogens, are critical to pathogen presentation, and are essential immune response regulating cells.  Neutrophils are a much more appropriate responses to allergenic particles than eosinophils, as the neutrophils themselves will attempt to dismantle and ingest the allergenic particles, whereas the eosinophils will at best martial an immune response that summons neutrophils to ingest the allergenic particles.  That a similar shift from local eosinophilia to local neutrophilia could be productive for other classifications of immunoresponse tweaking is something that I'll need to establish, though from a quick review of available information on granulocytes (ie, I'm reading Wikipedia) I get the impression that eosinophils are the most autotoxic of the white blood cells with many forms of inappropriate activation.  That's promising.

This is notable mostly as a speedbump.  It suggests that schizophrenics already have a shift in the balance of their immune system towards neutrophils and way from lymphocytes.  While this proves nothing immediately relevant to my research and doesn't suggest I should stop looking at this avenue, it is bad news in an intuitive base rates sense.  If increasing neutrophil activation is already occurring and it's not helping, the likelihood that a different kind of increased neutrophil activation will be helpful is rational to reduce, though not eliminate, at this juncture.

CCL11 is specifically a biomarker of eosinophils.  This suggests excess eosinophil activation is present in schizophrenics.  Other CCLs monitored in this study (CCL2, CCL3, CCL24, CXCL9, and CXCL10) are biomarkers of other kinds of immune cell or immune cell signalling compound, save for CCL24, which is another biomarker of eosinophil, which as an immune system signal attempts to recruit T lymphocytes and neutrophils.  CCL11 is notable for have a chemotactic effect on eosinophils, in other words, it recruits them.  This suggests that a specific malfunction occuring in schizophrenia may be eosinophils inappropriately recruiting each other to congregate around bits of nerve tissue for which their presence is rather unhealthy...

What is my vaccination target?  What am I proposing to teach the immune system cells to DO?  I see likenesses between these procedures which suggest that there is something here, but I can't succinctly specify a molecule.

If I understand this research correctly, this with a cap on it is the pollen allergen RNA used in the allergy vaccine.  I'm adding this here in case I decide I can learn more about how to pick an RNA target by looking it up.

Am I trying to get neutrophils to nibble off antigens so that eosinophils don't freak out about them?  Surely I'm misunderstanding the mechanism here.

I only have access to the abstract this time, yet it suggests that this paper talks about specifically identified autoantibodies in individuals.  Those would be my molecular targets for RNA vaccination.  Furthermore, in the category of 'paranoia bait', this infection-triggered concept basis suggests that curing schizophrenia may have some obscure benefits in terms of eliminating a source of triggerable instability in populations.

Since I need data contained in the full access and not presented in the abstract, I can only use this study as a stepping stone in the archive and an indicator that what I'm looking for exists to be found somewhere in the searchspace.

Retrieved 2021-2-5.)

(Quoted from beginning of source abstract)
"In 1916, von Economo first described encephalitis lethargica (EL), a CNS disorder presenting with pharyngitis followed by sleep disorder, basal ganglia signs (particularly parkinsonism) and neuropsychiatric sequelae."

(Quoted from source abstract)
"We investigated the possibility that this phenotype could be a postinfectious autoimmune CNS disorder, and therefore similar to Sydenham's chorea. Anti-streptolysin-O titres were elevated in 65% of patients. Furthermore, western immunoblotting showed that 95% of EL patients had autoantibodies reactive against human basal ganglia antigens.  These antibodies were also present in the CSF in four patients tested."

Since it's a 20 case study, 95% should mean they had a positive result on 19 of the 20 patients.

(Quoted from end of source abstract)
"Regional tissue comparisons showed that the majority of these autoantigens were specific to or enriched in CNS tissue. Immunohistochemistry with secondary staining localized antibody binding to neurons rather than glial populations. Further investigation is required to determine whether these antibodies affect neuronal function (i.e. whether they are pathogenic anti-neuronal antibodies). Histopathology in one case demonstrated striatal encephalitis with perivenous B- and T-lymphocytic infiltration. We believe an EL-like syndrome is still prevalent, and propose that this syndrome may be secondary to autoimmunity against deep grey matter neurons."

I have access to the full paper on this one.  If it tells me what autoantibodies are present, I may be able to pursue those in the archive... and... nothing.  Did I miss it?  It doesn't look like this research specifies molecular structures at all.

It does have some interesting stuff, so I'll leave it in the review log even if it doesn't make it into the finished product.

(Quoted from source)
"Over the last decade there has been increasing interest in immune-mediated movement and psychiatric disorders. The classic phenotype is Sydenham's chorea, which is characterized by chorea, motor weakness and behavioural disorders (particularly obsessive±compulsive disorder). The neurological syndrome occurs as a latent effect of group A streptococcal infections. More recently, motor tics in combination with a behavioural disorder have been described after streptococcal infections and have been termed paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) (Swedo et al., 1998)."

(Quoted from source)
"It is hypothesized that antibodies induced after group A streptococcus infection cross-react with components of the basal ganglia, resulting in movement and psychiatric disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of autoantibodies reactive against basal ganglia and subthalamic neurons in both Sydenham's chorea (Husby et al., 1976; Bronze and Dale, 1993; Church et al., 2002) and PANDAS (Kiessling et al., 1993). Recently, poststreptococcal dystonia as part of in¯ammatory autoimmune encephalitis has also been described (Dale et al., 2001). Although these descriptions suggest that the spectrum of poststreptococcal CNS disease is broader than previously described, the clinical phenotype remains predominantly localized to basal ganglia dysfunction (extrapyramidal movements and neuropsychiatric disease)."

I'm including this as a companion to the preceding, though technically it continues the tangent.  This is a commentary on the encephalitis lethargica research performed by the preceding source.

(Quoted from source)
"Several authors have previously detected antibodies to neuronal antigens in neurological diseases associated, at least in part, with streptococcal infections including Sydenham's chorea and PANDAS (paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections; Kiessling et al., 1993; Singer et al., 1998; Church et al., 2002). Indeed, one recent study suggests that such antibodies to streptococcal antigens cross-react with lysogangliosides on the neuronal cell surface (Kirvan et al., 2003)"

(Quoted from source)
"The two most convincing criteria of an antibody-mediated disorder, even in the absence of the detection of specific antibodies, are the response to immunosuppressive therapies and passive transfer of disease to experimental animals."

This comment about the absence of the detection of specific antibodies reaffirms my reading of the preceding source, which is that I couldn't find it alleging any specific molecular structure in operation.  I didn't just miss it.

If I can find *any* neuropsychiatric condition correctable by this method, that will be an advance of the kind I wish to make.  I fear only losing my search in the dissolution of specific focus.  I'm searching for any specific neural autoantibody.  I think I'm misunderstanding something in the mechanism here.  Going back to the pollen antigenic particle, the antigenic surface is the interesting part of it.  The RNA vaccine encodes for the production of the antigenic surface... and somehow doing this results in a shift of the immunoresponse from eosinophils to neutrophils.  I'm definitely missing links in this causal structure.

Traditional vaccines inject the antigenic surfaces.  That's really what a vaccine is, at root; it's a bunch of particles that the immune system is expected to react to in a manner which gives it competency against live viruses.  Insofar as the vaccine's antigenic particles are non-threats which inspire an immune response, vaccination relies upon something like the allergic response potential to otherwise-harmless particles.  RNA vaccines inject code that causes cells to produce the antigenic surfaces.  The same non-threat particles are being made, but locally.  Any kind of cell can potentially pick up the mRNA globules, manufacture antigen spikes, and display them on their surface, but dendritic cells are most eager to do so.  Dendritic cells have a stronger inclination towards phagocytosis, like other immune cells, yet specifically they are the most potent of the antigen presenting cells, being capable of coding antigenic response to naive T cells.

Dendritic cells can also induce immune tolerance somehow?  If there was some way to manipulate its presentation of quelling self-antigens, that would be great, but I'm not sure that's what's going on here...  If I think about what's described, it sounds like what is special here about the RNA vaccine is that the antigen is never "loose" in the intracellular space.  It only ever presents on the surface of cells.  Since they destroy the RNA in the process of encoding it, the cells only get as much of it as they absorb of RNA globules, and only the dendritic cells do that very eagerly.  So... the antigenic surface shows up as a molecular spike on unrelated cells?  Why is that helpful?

It looks like dendritic cells can nibble off antigens presented on the surface of other cells, too.  They have a really high surface area and are highly interactive with other cells, which activity includes phagocytosing bits of membrane off of them.  This all sounds very tuned for making only dendritic cells react to the antigen while preventing any cell from reacting to the antigen in the intercellular fluid.  Is there something about COVID-19 spike proteins and pollen particles which the dendritic cells are especially capable of correctly handling?  Alternatively, what changes because cells don't encounter the antigen loose?

This is a little more fathomable in the case of COVID-19 spike proteins.  The antigen is being specifically delivered to the most capable antigen presenter molecules, and this delivery is being performed without any active 'hostiles' in the vicinity.  The dendritic cells are in no danger of being turned into viral factories by independently growing these spikes or taking them off of other cells that grew them.  That bit of COVID-19 has no fusion mechanism and no payload when it exists on its own, yet it's still what we wish the immune system were really good at detecting and reacting badly to the presence of.  In this case the RNA vaccine's competency at delivering the antigen surface to the dendritic cells looks very salutary and straightforwardly so.

I'm less certain what is going on when the dendrites are encouraged to present an antigen surface from a pollen particle.  Do the dendrite cells learn from context cues which things are and are not pathogenic?  Is there something about the COVID-19 spike which is 'intrinsically' (by which I mean always) pathogenic, whereas conversely is there something about the pollen particle that requires specific conditions for it to be recognized as a pathogen?  It could be (I have not yet studied this, but am conjecturing) that the pollen particle when encountered in the intracellular medium may be a stressor upon surrounding cells which encourages improper immunoresponse and trains the immune system to sensitize itself, whereas the pollen particle antigenic surface presented exclusively of stressors may lack intrinsic pathogenicity qualities leading to it being presented to T cells in a tolerance-inducing way.  This deactivation of the central immune system would not then prevent neutrophils from congregating towards cellular stress signals to digest still-irritating but non-virulent pathogen particles.  Fortunately, I understand that to be the correct response to such intrusions, and other immune responses are not adaptive.  If this conjecture represents an appropriate understanding of the process, I can search for indications in the (scant, novel, alas) literature on RNA vaccinations as an allergy treatment for indications that the dendritic cells are in those cases using tolerance-induction.

I am aware of some amount of retread in my thoughts.  I am not an immunologist, merely an interested third party trying to grasp for a technological potential which would benefit society if it could be achieved, and I am expanding my understanding of vaccines in real time.  On which note, I am going back to the top of this file to read that first link again with an eye informed by greater study.  "Treatment of autoimmune arthritis using RNA interference-modulated dendritic cells", from the Journal of Immunology in 2010.  I can see in the abstract that it refers to "Ag-loaded" and "tolerogenic" dendritic cells, and an experimental procedure whereby tolerogenic dendritic cells were created encoded for a potentially antigenic particle.  Differently summarized:  The researchers created silencer dendrites that would circulate in the lymph nodes telling T cells to stop directing attacks against a particular kind of collagen structure.

This looks good for my concept of using RNA vaccines to modulate immune responses in both directions.  If the conditions for creating antigenic vs tolerogenic cellular structures can be clearly defined, fine-tuning the human immunoresponse profile becomes feasible.

What we want to do is to create tolerogenic dendritic cells for every critical internal surface in the body, while watching for signs of inappropriate pathogen tolerance consequent to the immune system losing targets which it had been using against actual pathogens.  (Autoimmunity is often learned from pathogens, as I believe occurs when the target which the immune system discovers on the pathogen is also present in the body's own constitution.)  This may necessitate a new generation of vaccinations against diseases for which vaccinations or widespread immunity are currently common, but now that I have some idea of what's going on in the intercellular medium with RNA vaccines vs regular vaccinations, I think we should do that anyways.  RNA vaccines are a more precise tool which should allow cross-reactivity to become a factor which occurs only to our benefit.

(quoted from source)
"Because we have previously used immature DCs to inhibit CIA progression (23), we sought to extend these findings to a system in which expression of specific costimulatory molecules may be knocked down. We observed that gene silencing of CD40, CD80, and CD86 achieved optimal protection from disease and induced Ag-specific Tregs in CIA mice. Collectively, the data presented here support the feasibility of gene-silenced DCs as a means of sup- pressing immune responses in autoimmunity."

I never thought I'd be so happy to see CIA mice.  CIA in this case means "collagen-induced arthritis".  In this paper, "knockdown of CD40, CD80, and CD86" is the method described in the abstract for achieving tolerogenic dendritic cells.  I also want to note that "we have previously used immature DCs to inhibit CIA progression" suggests I need to go read this paper's 23rd citation.  By that verbiage alone, I would infer that the researchers discovered greater immunocompetence from immature dendritic cells presented with arthritogenic particles, from which it would make sense that RNA vaccination (by the procecdure's high specificity for dendritic cells) may be intrinsically suitable for improving the competency and specificity of immunoresponse.  I feel bad for those mice who had to live and suffer for this.  I wish the research could have been performed on a homonculous model expressing only as much mouse as necessary to establish the effect.

I'm looking for information about that cluster of differentiation knockdown procedure.  It looks like dendritic cells were cultured on plates to produce a supply of immature dendritic cells separately from the rest of the immune system.  There are several 'as previously described' entries citing other works for details of procedures; presumably earlier work by this team or its lead authors.  I may need to read those.  The knockdown of the three CDs was performed only on the cultured dendritic cells.  It utilized siRNA transfection... silencing RNA.  This achieves a transient modification not applicable to descendant cells, so descendants of the modified cells would be ordinary immature dendritic cells, as would any further divisions in the cellular culture prior to further use.  That looks quite hygienic as a gene modification process goes, particularly with it occurring outside of the body in an environment specialized to its target cell population.

Without CD40, the dendritic cells would lack one of the standard agitants of the immune system.  CD80 and CD84 both appear to be hostile pathogen signaller receptors.  A dendritic cell lacking these three genes would be toothless.  It could only present pathogens in an "anergic" (tolerogenic) mode.  A replicating dendrite population with those traits would be highly toxic (as it would detrain the immune system to anything it picked up), but a single generation of that population matured on a diet of allergens, arthritogens, and self-antigens (three categories for which anergic responses are appropriate) could be potentially curative to numerous autoimmune disorders.

Hm...  If this involves culturing each patient's dendrites to generate tolerogenic dendrites pre-loaded with antigens targeted for tolerogenesis, this therapy starts to sound expensive.  It would involve time and specialist attention per patient.  I still think it would be worth investigating, because it would still be a humdinger of a treatment for quite a few things which are presently incurable.  It'd be better than a treatment.  This could be a cure.  Although this is duration-dependent as some of the problems averted by such a treatment may recur over time due to ongoing entropy in the immune system, as a curative treatment for presently incurable and often life-ruining conditions the lifetime productivity yield of this therapy combined with its preventative savings against other healthcare demands should exceed its cost of application in the majority of applications.  Special attention should be paid to mental health applications, for sources of great suffering within and hatreds between members of the public can be averted by cost-effective increases in mental healthcare technologies.

Next phase:  Assembling candidate neural antigenic surfaces.
Notable unknown:  How antigenic surfaces are corresponded with RNA encodings.

There are a lot of potential antigens, aren't there?  Tch...  I'm rereading another of my previously listed sources:
(2018, Sep)  Autoimmune phenotypes in schizophrenia reveal novel treatment targets.  *Pharmacology and Therapeutics,

This is talking about correlations between schizophrenia and great swathes of autoimmune disorders, including celiac disease, but only notably excluding rheumatoid arthritis.  Looking at the extensive cross-associations alone almost makes me wonder if being in pain all the time from autoimmune disorders just makes people chaotic in a bad way.  Could the cure to schizophrenia be a general allergen and autoimmune panel using tolerogenic engineered dendrites to simultaneously dampen a swathe of inappropriate self-reactivities?  Concentrating the treatments should be healthiest, since that minimizes the duration over which the immune system has hypertolerant dendrites circulating in it.  If a general allergen and autoimmune panel of tolerogenic dendrites is a cure for schizophrenia, the public would hardly need to be sold a schizophrenia cure as such.  They could with total honesty be sold as a general treatment for allergies such as I've already advocated.  This technology is very promising.

I need to continue studying RNA vaccines to determine the current state of the art in tolerogenic RNA.  If any of this material points towards a diversely applicable true vaccine, that would be far more swiftly spectacular than a cultured dendrite protocol.  Either would be spectacular, but I'd rather not write a paean to the second best just yet!  It doesn't look like the allergy vaccination research used cultured dendrites, however I am also not sure that it utilized tolerogenic injections to achieve its results.  I'm hoping that a more straightforward tolerogenesis solution is possible for autoantibodies as well.

I don't have access to this and therefore can't use it, but I'm listing it for interest.  If there's a general solution available for immune response tailoring, these kinds of broad reviews will be helpful in establishing the protocol for that general solution.

I'm still not sure how antigenic surfaces can be encoded in RNA, currently.  The part that tells me which piece of RNA to feed to the dendrites is still missing from my understandig.

I wonder if I should be researching how an RNA encoding pattern was invented for the COVID-19 viral spike protein.  I've seen points in the literature which claim that RNA vaccinations are "plug and play".  If there's some step that simplifies the discovery of RNA encoding patterns for an antigenic surface, I should like to find it.  If I could propose a panel of specific targets for tolerogenic treatment with an estimated cumulative probability of thereby accounting for schizophrenia-related neuroinflammatory properties derived from the frequency of comorbidity, I would consider that an excellent research outcome strongly supportive of a valuable real world research project.

I am concerned that studying COVID-19 may be unproductive due to flooding of the searchspace.  There's so much activity that drilling down to exactly the process of development that I'm interested in may be easier if I can find similar research on other targets rather than relying on the COVID-19 research itself.

Hm, this may also be a way to cure Guillain-Barré syndrome, repairing one category of vaccine injury IRL and making vaccines factually safer.  That relies on a more easily defined target classification for the antibodies.  The problem in Guillain–Barré syndrome is anti-ganglioside antibodies.  The cultured dendrite treatment described earlier should be able to cure that.  Maintaining a supply of separately matured anergic dendrites may be a useful supportive treatment for neural illnesses more generally, in order to prevent disruption of patient capabilities by immune mistraining over the course of fighting the illness.  This would be suitable for in-patient care, but should result in accelerated healing.

There's potential overlap with the schizophrenia concept as well, depending on the still unknown question of which neurological antibodies are operant in the (conjectured) autoimmune model of schizophrenia.

Viewing schizophrenia as a cumulative structure caused by many neglected minor injuries rather than by a singular etiology, an attempt to vaccinate against schizophrenia as through cultured tolerogenic dendrites or an unknown direct RNA method might require a tolerogenic vaccination for celiac's disease, which should be noted as another name for grain allergy.

It also mentions possible age-related weakening of the brain-blood barrier, suggesting that pushing back petty brain permeability insults from the immune system may have anti-senescent functions as well.  This is further support for the concept that a general course of allergy vaccination across the entire population would be highly productive.

I'm going to need to find a way to reorganize this content eventually.  It looks like this is sort of a "studying a discipline" exercise which should have more subsorting involved as the amount of content continues to accrete.  I believe I'll be able to very excitedly chase this pattern for a long time, but it looks like defining many contributing causalities for a syndrome that I suspect describes a cluster of outcomes rather than a shared single etiology appears to be a complex task.  The unifying excitement factor here is the possibility for an actual product to be constructed which would tune immunoresponses in a way yielding both intelligence and happiness to its beneficiaries.  Every step forward yields the promise of the potential applications for RNA vaccination's mode of interface with the immune system...  Which reminds me, I need to study the pollen vaccination's mechanism again.

I'm a little self-conscious about the daily restudying factor required for trying to build up my understanding of this tech.  I've never had to do that for classwork.  I think I'll standardize at least the 'source opens section' rule, and I may revise older sections to clarify that.  I'm considering dividing the chronology by date where supported by retrieval date, but I'm not committed to that scheme yet.

Returning to this paper, it appears to have delivered a plasmid encoding RNA for an antigenic surface without specific preparation for ensuring tolerogenic response.  Given my previous reasoning about the nature of the specialization of the RNA vaccines (which is that it delivers particles to dendrites with high specificity), I would infer that this delivered pathogen spikes to dendrites in a non-stressing way.  The dendrites would then have matured (from acquiring pathogens to present) and migrated to the lymphatic system for delivery of new information (its new antigenic surface) to the immune system.

The study reports that "antigen-specific IgG1" was significantly elevated in vaccinated mice in comparison to unvaccinated control mice.  Digressing to improve my understanding of antigen-specific IgG1...  IgG is "Immunoglobin G".  Approximately 75% of serum antibodies are IgG variants specific to the antigenic surface.  These Y-shaped proteins are tipped with a pair of binding points specific to the antigen.  Cellular structures with antigen-specific IgG1 attached to them are marked for destruction by the immune system, as well as being directly impaired in mobility characteristics and encouraged to bind uselessly to each other (as each Y-shaped protein can bind to two structures).  A pathogen coated in Immunoglobin G has been "opsonized" and will be phagocytosed if detected by a phagocytotic immune cell (most of them).

It reports that antigen-specific IgG2a was found only in prevaccinated mice, suggesting that they produced an additional antigen which the control mice did not productive.

Conversely, IgE spiked in control mice, but was low or absent in vaccinated mice.  IgE is "Immunoglobin E".  IgE is the least abundant type of antibody with 'normal' levels at 0.05% of antibodies.  Like the much more abundant Immunoglobin G, Immunoglobin E is a Y-shaped protein which functions by agglomerating on pathogenic surfaces to mark them for immunoresponse.  It is the most potently inflammatory class of antibody.  The IgE immunoresponse category is different from the IgG category, actuated by type 1 and type 2 Fcε receptors.  It is correctly deployed against parasites and cancer.  It is incorrectly deployed against allergens/

So the two differences between the vaccinated vs unvaccinated immunoresponse are that only the vaccinated mice produced IgG2a, and that significant IgE production was seen only in the unvaccinated mice.  It looks like this allergy vaccine sensitizes the immune system to "a pathogen" - and then deploys increased numbers of IgG antibodies at it rather than deploying IgE antibodies at it.  The IgG-coated pathogen mildly inflames its vicinity, becomes opsonized, and is then eaten by neutrophils (which is *correct* disposal for allergens) whereas the IgE-coated pathogen would have caused an utter inflammatory panic in the region, become opsonized, and then gotten eaten by eosinophils (which are more toxic than neutrophils).

This strategy is not quite as promising for unlearning immunoresponses as cultured dendrite therapy would be, however it is not useless in the pursuit of mental health, as it would likely represent a considerable advance in the treatment of celiac disease with only a single injection... if the result generalizes across other allergens, and if the functioning of the mouse immune system generalizes to humans.  There's a lot of stuff here that looks to me like it would be less likely to generalize successfully than the cultured tolerogenic dendrite therapy, which despite its relative laboriousness presents a unique and very potent medical opportunity.

I may end up crafting my first essay in this category to be a proposal for a protocol generalizing cultured dendrite therapy to other antigenic surfaces for immediate broader study.  Controlled unlearning of improper immunoresponses would provide significant advances for life extension and healthspan if it could be proven generally safe at a skill level suitable for widespread performance.  In which case, with that ambition, I am nearer to a first draft than I thought I was, as I should be able to author that as a commentary upon one paper.  I think I'll give that its own page.

Reader beware; tolerogenic dendrites could also be used to produce antivaccines to enhance the effectiveness of bioweapons.  Coadministration of malevolently tolerogenic dendrites alongside active samples of the pathogen whose immunoresponse they oppose would lead to unusually virulent infections.

As I've introduced it without explanation, I should spare a note here for Tolerogenic RNA Vaccination vs Hypercompetent RNA Vaccination, as it may prove a less ambitious essay which I would therefore complete first.  This essay would describe for its hypothetical reader the distinct possibilities that I have discovered in this file for potential RNA vaccination mechanisms.  In brief: a tolerogenic RNA vaccination is loaded with dendritic cells that have been programmed to disarm one of the immune system's (presumably faulty) activation patterns, whereas a hypercompetent RNA vaccination is highly specific to dendritic cells while avoiding as much as possible the release of loose pathogenic molecules and concomitant cellular stresses.  In the essay, I'll compare and contrast the two modes, with citations linking them to current research as much as possible.  I hope to thereby support the development of both avenues of research, although as I suspect tolerogenic RNA vaccination of broader applicability and greater rejuvenation potential, I hope to see it advanced farther and faster than hypercompetent RNA vaccination.

Is this another kind of RNA vaccination?  Would the antigen-specific monoclonal antibody provide lingering or temporary protection?  Is this a third vaccine method, or is it a treatment?  How are mRNA encodings devised for specific molecular structures?

When I looked at the abstract for this, I realized that I have many questions about its position relative to what I've been studying.  I didn't even know what a monoclonal antibody was!  I now know that monoclonal antibodies are general 'grabber tools' used in biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine for their general and engineerable cell-marking applications.
