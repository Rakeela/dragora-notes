04:25.  I'm being troubled by excess energy.  I was too energetic when I was laying down to bed to quickly get to sleep, too energetic four hours later when I woke up again, and I was even energetic in my dreams, where I dreamed of a kaiju-befriending squad.

05:16.  I got up with the idea of an early start to my day, but even fully dressed, I'm stuck thinking about bed.  I guess I'll lay down again.  I'm still superficially energetic.

09:57.  No wonder I was energetic last night.  I forgot to take risperidone.  I'll take it this morning, but that'll sedate me all day.  Today is not likely to be a productive day.

10:26.  I should go visit the dermatologist and check on my prescription for my psoriasis medication.

15:09.  I finished a book on comparative study of religions from a Taoist perspective.

15:14.  I also took a trip to Half Price Books.  I meant to say so in the same time point, but I got distracted eating okra chips, then onion chips.

15:18.  57,621.  Writing feels a bit pointless when I can't market my stuff.  I'm not even good at writing.

15:20.  I'm writing in prison.  I'm too mentally ill to contribute to society in a regular way.  I have a ton of time because Kistaro supports me.

15:24.  57,644.  I'm lacking confidence in how to finish this chapter.  2,131 words on the chapter.

15:55.  57,924.

16:28.  58,179.  2,666 words on the chapter.

16:43.  58,240.  Ugh.  Progress is hard today.  Will I even make quota?  The whole draft is threatening to complete much too quickly, but I don't know how to write the rest of it.

18:05.  58,873.  3,358 words on the chapter.

18:26.  58,868.  Strange, why'd the word count go down?  Anyways, I took a break for food.  I ate a horrible flatulence-inducing cookie, and then I cooked and ate a pack of ramen.  I should eat more ramen.  I feel pretty good about it.  It's cheap and satisfying.  I bought a bunch of ramen thinking, "If I eat nothing but ramen for a while, how much will I actually eat?"  I wasn't able to commit to eating that much ramen.  I want to go to the store and buy more ramen and then try again.  I need to hand-wash one of the pots I use for ramen if I'm to keep up with a high rate of ramen eating, but...  I think it'd be healthy for me.  It's a very humble food.

20:37.  I played Age of Wonders 4 with Kistaro for a bit.  It's very fun being a dragon lord.  My current dragon lord is a shadow dragon, but he's investing in every kind of magic simultaneously.  I imagine he's just voraciously curious and incapable of constraining his interest to one domain.  If it's magic, he wants it.  If not now, eventually.

21:04.  59,074.  204 words on the chapter.  1,453 words of progress.  Wow, quota.  I barely made it this time.
