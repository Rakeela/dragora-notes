# HeLa-cells

Likely to be an unsorted list of thoughts, if anything reminds me of this.

HeLa cells are one of my favorite enigmas, and thinking so much about [[mitochondria]] recently has me wondering if the mitochondria in HeLa cells are somehow special.  Are they producing rare proteins?  Are they directing the cells towards unusual gene silencing?

I wonder also if the processing bodies ([[P-bodies]]) of HeLa cells are unusual.
