#2023-05-23-Four-Hundred-and-Fifty-First

8:23.  Woke up two hours ago now?  Just sorta getting going on stuff.  First thing I'm thinking: Yesterday, I actually referenced my records for some stuff related to my writing productivity.  Yay, it's useful!

8:26.  I got up early yesterday and the day before.  It was easy on those days.  This morning, I got up early again, but it was hard.  While I was struggling to get up, I asked a dream entity for a backrub.  Felt good, and it helped.  I got moving after that.

8:28.  The minutes are just slipping by.  I don't know what's wrong with my sense of time right now.  It's unpleasant.  The last five minutes have felt like fifty seconds.  Anyways.  I was thinking I wanted to talk about my kobold tribe simulation.  It doesn't feel like working.  It's hard to contribute to, and it doesn't give me that sense of accomplishment which I get from writing.

8:34.  Ugh.  I haven't "gotten going on stuff" at all.  Time is still slipping by.  I got my treadmill out.  I can at least walk while time is passing swiftly.

8:41.  I'm having a second energy drink.  Maybe this will fix my sense of time.  It's not usually like this, I think.  The first energy drink was right after I got up.

11:39.  I did osme work on my kobold simulator.  I finished another card and updated it for the partially implemented crime simulation.  I have three categories of crime in the simulation: crimes of poverty, crimes of chaos, and crimes of cunning.  I'm going to fold them into one crime stat eventually.

11:43.  9,305 words on the file.

11:48.  9,312 words on the file.  Just doing a bit of editing and review.  I don't think I'll credit myself for it this time.

13:18.  10,678.  1,366 words on the chapter.  1,373 words of progress.

13:41.  10,999.  1,687 words on the chapter.  1,694 words of progress.  I could theoretically call that done for the day, but I just want to take a break and get back to it.  I've already walked for four hours on my treadmill, so I'm taking a break from that, too.

14:12.  I had a perfectly enjoyable little break visiting three grocery stores on my scooter and I didn't buy a thing.  All it cost me was time.  I kept active throughout.  It's a push scooter, not a motorized one!

14:13.  Calories-in/Calories-out is such garbage.  I stay active, I eat lightly, and I barely lose weight.

14:15.  I'm just not convinced that the calories I burn matter at all to my weight loss.  I can lose weight eating lightly and sitting on my ass.  My hips hurt less if I do it that way, though more than not at all.  An hour or two of walking each day is what minimizes hip pain.

15:17.  I missed a dermatology appointment today.  I didn't have my phone configured to set an alert.  I thought it would alert me!  I remembered the appointment a few hours after it should've happened.

16:31.  I'm depressed.  I want food.  These are tightly linked for me.  I'm tired.  I want to lay down and do nothing.  Eating probably wouldn't help with the tiredness, but the tiredness still makes it harder not to eat something.  I went ahead and ate a sugar free "Reese's Zero Sugar Miniatiure Cup"...

16:34.  My weight hasn't dropped back to what it was before I stopped my last round of dieting.  However, I'm on my way.  I'm only two pounds above what I weighed before I stopped dieting most recently.  My current round of dieting is slated for another 255 hours.  10.625 days remain.  Completing this next diet will lower my weight yet again.

17:36.  I thought I'd feel less like eating when I got up from laying down for a while.  An hour, I guess it turned out to be.  I didn't set a timer or anything.  I still feel a lot like eating.  Unbelievably like eating.

17:39.  Gotta go to the store and buy a toothbrush.  I didn't brush my teeth last night, and I don't like to skip it.

19:35.  I'm watching a dinosaur documentary.  Prehistoric Planet 2.  Dinosaurs look cool, but nature documentaries are kind of depressing.

19:50.  You'd think as a dragon that I'd want to be closer to nature, but no.  I do not.  I've never liked meat that much.  Vegetarianism wasn't as big of a sacrifice as it might've been.  I like violence even less.  I don't like to think of any creature being in pain.  Hunting is a violent infliction of pain that yields meat.  I am not a fan.

19:54.  Theoma is a fantasy of peaceful dragons.

20:04.  I still want to eat something.  Dieting sucks.

20:06.  I want to breach 180 pounds.  If I seriously get there, I am taking /a while/ off of dieting.  Like once I see my scale say I weigh 179.5 pounds, I am cutting out of my dieting at least until I weigh 190 pounds.
