I quite enjoy collecting cultural traces such as my [[Notable-Videogames]] list.  It's all meaningless and nobody reads it, right?  Still, my thoughts survive longer.

I've been struggling to read a book on basic chemistry, and I think instead I'm going to mark another partial in my [[Bibliography]].  I don't need to read the entire book.  I'm already well past most of it.  Nonfiction has this problem; I have difficulty reading arbitrary nonfiction.

I've forgotten my particular scheme for recording these and will (probably) update this post later to get it right, but this is an important one regarding the effects of abortion rights.  Sixty percent of people who have abortions are already parents, and need to focus on taking care of the kids they already have!  Abortion rights really do improve childcare quality!  I wish conservatives cared more about that.
