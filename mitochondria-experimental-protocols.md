# Mitochondria Experimental Protocols

Sharing a cluster with [[necessary-experimental-tools]] and extending from the base node [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]], this node is for accumulating information about specific protocols.  I don't know what I'm doing, mind you, but...

Meta-note to myself: This QtA structure may have other applications.

Question to answer:  How to kill the basal mitochondria in the experimental bacterial population, guaranteeing purity for the novel mitochondrial descent line
Conjecture:  Mitochondrial vulnerabilities vary, if the novel descent line lacked a vulnerability present in the basal population, selective toxicity could be used post-implantation to eliminate mitochondria other than the target population.
Note:  It may be desirable during initial experimentation to establish that replication of the minority mitochondria occurs /at all/, without immediate concern for purity.  The proof of concept experiment is only ever going to end up in the compost bin; medical grade output is the eventual intention, but it's not necessary to start there.

Question to answer:  Optimal growing conditions for E. coli strain K12
Note:  Stock protocol question whose difficulty I expect will be extremely similar to "where do I get a supply of E. coli strain K12", but it's important to mark it as a known unknown.

Question to answer:  Optimal mitochondrial separation protocol
Concern:  I'm concerned that fractionated centrifugation will destroy the mitochondria as they're separated from the cells holding them.  While that's acceptable for early research (compost bin era), if I want to get to a bioreactor production stage, I need a way to extract the product in a viable form.

Question to answer:  Storage medium for mitochondria
Note:  Copying this here.  I mentioned this concern in more detail in the exogenous mitochondria node.
