After I finished the homework last night, I was left feeling like there wasn't enough of it.  I may go back and see if the "similar question" button will let me use it even if I got the question right.

I've moved to the back of the class to let me get away more completely with not following the lecture.  Side effect, I *can't* follow the lecture.  The whiteboard is too far away for me to read.  Attending this class is a complete waste of my time, and I'm self-conscious about that.  Kistaro thinks I'll gain subconscious fluency by attending.  I think I'm likely to ruin that by doing things like working on my writing for the hour that I'm stuck in here.

The opening lessons in this calculus book seem to focus on manipulating functions.  There's apparently a lot of manipulating functions in calculus.  I don't have the right intuition for it yet.  I keep thinking that I don't "grok" this.  I don't understand it completely.  I can sort of struggle through, and I'll keep struggling through while I'm able, but we'll see what grade that actually gets me.

It'll be strange if I stay an honors student while struggling through feeling like I'm not understanding things.

The professor has just rejected a simplification step.  I hope that I don't have to remember which way he wants that problem simplified on tests and homework.

Something something VARS.  Something to do with how to use a graphing calculator.  I don't see a VARS key on my beloved graphing calculator.  I don't know how to use Y1 and Y2 in equations on my calculator.  I'm recording this here in case I can figure it out later.
