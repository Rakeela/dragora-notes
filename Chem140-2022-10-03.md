I don't know the teacher's notation for dimensional analysis.  It confuses me.  I did manage to solve a problem doing it the way the teacher did it, but I don't think I can do that on my own yet.

amu = atomic mass unit
1 amu defined as 1.66x10^-24g
Arbitrary standard isotope C-12 = 12.00 amu defined
1 amu = 1/12th the mass of C-12 = 1.66x10^-24g

Protons and neutrons are nucleons.
Protons (p) (+ charge) have a mass of 1.0073 amu.
Neutrons (n) have no charge, and have a mass of 1.0087 amu.
Electrons (e) (- charge) have a mass of 0.0005 amu
Atoms are neutral (positive charge equals negative charge).  The number of protons equals the number of electrons.
Neutrons are not given on the periodic table.  Neutrons need to be given in data.  Sometimes mass number given.
Mass number = p+n = always whole number
If the neutron count is given, the mass number can be calculated; if the mass number is given, the neutron count can be calculated.

The mass number may be given as a superscript preceding the element.  The atomic number may be given as a subscript preceding the element.  (Really?  Did I misunderstand?  Atomic number doesn't change.)

I am having some difficulty understanding how this teacher wants problems solved.  The problems themselves are only a little challenging, but I am not working them correctly, and she has been very clear that she will subtract points on tests for not showing exactly the steps that she expects.

She also wants us to time ourselves while studying the problems.  I seem to be doing okay for velocity, gauging against the rest of the class.  That's as far as I want to evaluate myself.  Actually timing myself seems stressful.

Any number larger than the thousands place and any number smaller than the thousandths place should be in scientific notation.  1,000=okay; 10,000=1E4; 0.001=okay; 0.0001=1E-4
