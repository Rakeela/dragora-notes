I kinda feel like I maybe watched this before, but I don't think so.  I'll mark this as my first time.

The Earthseed people think cybernetic biostasis can be a thing.  I think it sounds hopeless.  There'll never be enough detail recorded in logs of people to reconstruct the actual people.  You'd need some kind of pantemporal surveillance to do it.  Or you'd need neural surveillance stretching far into history.

Meowth made a crass joke!  That damaged the whole movie to me.

Eee!  Team Rocket is doing something heroic!  The movie is redeemed!
