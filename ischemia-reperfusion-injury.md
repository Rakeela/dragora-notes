# Ischemia Reperfusion Injury

Ischemia reperfusion injury is further injury inflicted to [[ischemic-tissues]] when oxygen access is restored.  I know nothing of what causes this.  Reperfusion is necessary for recovery from ischemia, but apparently it inflicts further damage?  The mechanism is related to [[mitochondria]] somehow, and some research has examined [[exogenous-mitochondria]] as a protective tool against IRI.
