I've been struggling to think of anything to record today.  I've just been reading.  All day reading.  Devouring this Unbound Soul series.

I guess I could share that I found a chocolate in my inventory that I'd failed to record in my [[Candy-Vault]].  I added it... and immediately subtracted it, deciding to eat it.  I ate the whole thing.  Now I'm going to list it in the "Hall of Shame" section to remind myself not to buy it again.  I should've stopped after a few bites, but I guess that's not how I work.  Still, accumulating a Hall of Shame is still like getting somewhere.

My weight ping-pongs around.  If I eat lightly, it goes down.  If I don't eat, it goes down.  If I eat sweets all day, it soars.  It's become apparent to me that I can eat one treat per day, and one small healthy meal.  That's the threshold of losing weight.  It's also slower than fasting, and somehow better than fasting, even though I can't put my finger on why.  It's what my fasting breaks down into, and I still lose weight doing that.

I haven't tried no treats and two small healthy meals, but I think that would work as well.  Talk about dissatisfying, though.  It's not that healthy food tastes bad... quite the contrary... it's that I really want sweets.

I still intend to resume actual fasting soon, and with an ambitious target.  I'm going to do it for real this time!  I want to fast for 12.5 days.  Soon.  I guess I shouldn't say "I'm going to" because I have a terrible track record.  I want to.

One treat and one small healthy meal leaves me hungry most of the time, which I guess is easier than being hungry ALL the time.  It lets me decide twice per day that I can't handle being hungry, and then I get temporary relief from it.  The small healthy meal relief lasts longer than the treat relief, so strictly from a minimizing hunger perspective I should be eating healthy, but it's not just about minimizing hunger.  I *can't* give up my sweet tooth.

This Unbound Soul series has made me think that I want to write a teacher character.  I want to write a dragon with teacherly wisdom.  No, okay, speaking more straightforwardly, this Unbound Soul series has made me wish I could reincarnate with my memories as a dragon in a system where I can get a Teacher class and system-boosted mental stats to go with it.

I want to make Taltios a teacher.  For the second time ever - the first time being when Kistaro told me that even farmers go on vacations - I want to write a Taltios story in Theoma.  I think that'll be book four... when I finish Ekis' Travelogue, aka book three.

One thing I was reluctant to record, but which I feel I ought to as this log is partially intended to be a true record of how I think, is that my weight doesn't quite feel like it follows a logical materialistic progression.  It feels like it bounces around in response to something more arbitrarily judgmental.  The judgmental thing considers even normal "three meals a day" kind of eating to be considerably excessive and marks that for weight gain over time, and seems to consider that appropriate eating amounts to two light meals per day.  Eating three light meals per day seems to provoke weight increases.  Eating what modern society considers 'moderate' is what this unknown judge seems to consider excessive, so it's necessary to appease it by eating 'lightly'.

One of the things that upset me was when I seemed to gain weight from a day where I ate a record amount of cocoa butter.  It was like... what?  But that stuff literally can't provoke an insulin response!  How would it hormonally induce my body to store ANYTHING?

Another thing that didn't upset me except for its seemingly illogical nature is a three day stretch when I went from fasting to eating lightly and my weight kept falling.  It should've bounced upwards despite the fact that I wasn't eating much.  The simple weight of food in my gut should've caused an increase, along with the increased water retention from having food in me, even if the weight increase was ephemeral and the overall trend continued downwards.

My knowledge of metabolism isn't doing as well as it should in predicting the movements of my weight.  Anomalies keep cropping up.  I wish I were just a machine.
