I've bought a can of Steel Reserve.  This is my favorite beer.  I can't drink beer while fasting.  It's pure weight gain.  I'm thinking as I drink it that my favorite beer still isn't very good to me.  All beer is pretty disgusting.

Evening weigh-in:  252.7 pounds.

Ugh.  I can binge up an absurd amount of weight in two days.  Kistaro doesn't think I'm turning anorexic, I think zie's wrong.  Pretty soon I won't be willing to eat on the weekend either.  I don't seem to be capable of a healthy approach to food.  I may just starve to death.
