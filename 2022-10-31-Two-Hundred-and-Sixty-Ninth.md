I've thought about the flavors of decaf coffee that I have on hand, and I've decided that I can taste the difference between them.  I like the "donut shop blend" best.  Or maybe better said, I dislike it least...  I drink decaf coffee because Kistaro has told me that it's good for my health, with the potential to reduce neural inflammation.  I don't drink it because I like it.

I spent today writing, and I'm honestly tempted to drop out of college to focus on writing.  It's not too much torture to just write all day.  Maybe I can be a professional writer.  I couldn't do this back when I was trying to write porn, but now that I'm writing Theoma, it seems doable.
