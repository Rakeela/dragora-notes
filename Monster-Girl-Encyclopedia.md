#Monster-Girl-Encyclopedia

If you gender-reversed this book, it would be the Monster Guy Encyclopedia, about extremely pleasurable men whose extremely pleasurable dicks raped women into perfect loyal wives.  The most fantastical thing about this is that it would be considered a horrifically narcissistic male fantasy.  Note that the book unreversed, being about women who reduce men to sex objects and rape them into perfect loyal husbands, is also considered a horrifically narcissistic male fantasy.  The Dark Matter monster girl exemplifies this tendency: the male libido is represented as a featureless tentacular singularity.

I would say that the fact that in both cases (Monster Guys and Monster Girls alike) this would be considered a male fantasy is a sign of the misandry of our society.

Also, I note that the book is singularly hostile to polyamory.  Stable polyamorous relationships intrinsically undermine its "and then they copulated forever" schtick.  I think the whole book really *is* supposed to be a send-up of Monster Guys: demon-men who think their dickvotions should make any woman loyal to them.  In this sense, polyamory strikes me as an obvious rebuttal to any Monsters who happen to inhabit the romantic world.

Sexuality needs to be more balanced.  I would interpret this book as *extremely* anti-sexual, just like when illiberals sexualize slugs; why is that treated as an inconceivable conclusion?  Why is it inconceivable for people to value empathy in sexuality?  Sex-positive communities rely on empathy in order to exist; they fall apart in sexual trauma if people engage without empathy in them.

It's like we live in the world where conservatives learned to draw the most maximally abusive porn possible as a way to victimize society for turning away from the child-eating natalist traditions that kept humanity locked in cycles of genocidal warfare for thousands of years.  If you don't eat this kitten (uncritically applaud this uncharismatic perversion), you're not a true liberal!

Anyways, I don't mind this.  People should have the freedom to make all the uncharismatic porn, too.  Liberals just need to reclaim the freedom to have taste in porn without accepting the framing that they're fake liberals if they do.  We don't accept the bad restoration of *Behold the Man* as the equal of the original, and we also don't have to accept that all representations of sexuality are equal.
