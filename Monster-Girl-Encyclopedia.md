#Monster-Girl-Encyclopedia

If you gender-reversed this book, it would be the Monster Guy Encyclopedia, about extremely pleasurable men whose extremely pleasurable dicks raped women into perfect loyal wives.  The most fantastical thing about this is that it would be considered a horrifically narcissistic male fantasy.  The book unreversed, being about women who reduce men to sex objects and rape them into perfect loyal husbands, is also considered a horrifically narcissistic male fantasy.

I would say that the fact that in both cases (Monster Guys and Monster Girls alike) this would be considered a male fantasy is a sign of the misandry of our society.
