8:59.  I tried to resist the siren song of a bar of reserve chocolate, but I failed.  I'm now eating a bowl of broccoli be'f (or is it broccoli b'ef?), and while the texture and flavor of the faux-meat is 100% wrong, it's delicious for its own thing.

9:07.  Oh, I feel like I overate!  And my nose is running now.  I'm keeping up with it, but it makes for a brisk morning jog.

9:10.  Ow, my left my left foot.  I'm considering my treadmill.  It's hard for me to focus without it, though lately I've been totally unfocused anyways.

9:11.  I gave AI Dungeon a scenario likely to go pornographic and then coached it through pages of gryphon porn.  Along the way, I found myself wishing that I'd set up a war plot instead, because porn is kinda repetitive, but the characters were very interesting.

9:37.  I got distracted reading TvTropes.  Waste of time...

11:34.  I ate another bar of reserve chocolate!

11:40.  61,085.

13:17.  62,345.  1,260 words of progress.  Good!  This is flowing better today.  But I'm at a stall point and I want to walk away for a bit.  I'm going to go buy a donut.  BRB.

13:50.  I can't believe it's already 2024.  Like, we could say, "It's the twenties!" the way people used to say, "It's the nineties!"  Why don't I hear people say it's the twenties?  "The twenties" still seem to refer to the 1920's.  Why does the twentieth century have a monopoly on this?

13:53.  2,187 words on the chapter.  Does it need to be longer?

14:01.  I have no ideas for what to have happen next, and I'm embarrassed about a dumb mistake I made on a Discord server.  Nobody else pointed it out, but there's a comment I dare not make lest someone recall what I deleted.

14:09.  I set up a point of tension, then I resolved it very rapidly.  The next point of tension... is going to be a literal kaiju!

15:02.  63,033.  1,948 words of progress.  Better than I've done lately.  I know I have a kaiju coming up.

15:43.  Ate three chik'n tenders.  The semblance of meat is better here, but still not ideal...  I say, thinking that I'd prefer these to chicken even if I weren't vegetarian.  I miss eating organ meats, not conventional meats.

15:55.  63,240.  2,155 words.

16:13.  Ate a key lime tea cookie.

16:29.  I have some deep fried cajun peanuts I've been snacking on today.  I just ate two of them.  I ate more earlier, but I forgot to record them.

17:05.  63,687.  2,602 words.

17:33.  I ate another 3 chik'n tenders, and now I'm eating a bar of reserve chocolate.  I broke myself of the tendency to hide my eating pretty quickly once I started focusing on doing it, but I haven't redeveloped my inclination to restrict eating.

17:38.  Another bar of reserve chocolate!  Man, I just want virtual food.  

18:28.  64,808.  3,723 words of progress.

20:24.  I got distracted with She-Ra.  Since I was kinda satisfied with my wordcount, I didn't fight the distraction much.

22:05.  I took another bar of reserve chocolate.

22:12.  I've just been burning through my reserve chocolate.  Once I started in on it, I couldn't stop.  I wanted more, and more, and more.
