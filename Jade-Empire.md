#Jade-Empire

I have played this game all the way through at least once!  I believe I have done it twice, but I am not sure.  I am reasonably confident that I will eventually play it all the way through a third time.  It is remarkably fun.  I enjoyed the gameplay in a way that I have enjoyed few action games.  I remember the colosseum fights especially.  I also really enjoyed the beautiful setpieces.  The graveyard of the capital is my favorite area, but nearly the entire game is glorious.

Philosophy

I remember in the lead-up to this game's release, that there was buzz about how it had "open palm" and "closed fist" instead of "good" and "evil".  Unfortunately, the vast majority of the "open palm" options were benevolent, while the vast majority of the "closed fist" options were villainous.  The writers did not live up to their buzz about going beyond good and evil.
