5:32.  I seem to wake up around 5:10 on many mornings, and if I get up then, I get up easier than at any other time.  Not that I didn't spend 22 minutes on unaccountable things.  How long did it take me to get dressed?  How much time did I spend browsing Goodreads?  I don't know.  I certainly haven't had breakfast.  My one meal for today is nine hours away.

6:38.  I sometimes think about the idea of cybernetic biostasis.  It's hopeless.  There's no way to store enough data to permit an accurate reconstruction of a person.  Furthermore, the continuity of consciousness is irrevocably lost.  Restoring an individual would require time travel.  Barring that, you'd have to form a connection to their brain well before they died.

6:53.  62,612.  753 words on the chapter.  0 words of progress.

7:37.  63,356.  1,497 words on the chapter.

8:27.  64,678.  2,619 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.

9:40.  65,338.  856 words on the chapter.  

10:07.  65,723.  1,241 words on the chapter.

10:36.  66,076.  1,594 words on the chapter.

10:45.  66,265.  1,783 words on the chapter.

11:03.  I have read a bit of my book on Manichaeism, and it seems to me that this faith commits the sin of making the perfect the enemy of the good, and fails to acknowledge at all that people of other faiths might also purify the light in all things.

11:58.  67,011.  2,529 words on the chapter.  Gotta wrap up what I'm doing with this chapter.  Now I'm finally having Kura and Kaire adventure together, after over two thirds of the book's planned length... the last third will be the rescue of Nevein!

12:15.  67,299.  2,815 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.  4,687 words of progress.

12:28.  I'm thinking about eating a pizza for my one meal today.  Just an entire pizza.  1,200 calories.

12:33.  I am distracted and exhausted.  I'm sort of standing here demoralized about the prospect of walking farther on my treadmill, and having difficulty thinking about anything but being tired and unwilling to walk.  I guess I should put the treadmill away so I can focus on writing again.

12:35.  I should've said "tired, hungry, and unwilling to walk".  I'm about 113 minutes from my next meal.  I haven't settled on the pizza for sure, but there's a real risk that I'll do worse if I eat anything else.

12:49.  Well, I'm off my feet, but I'm still kinda demoralized.  99 minutes, I guess?  I did write a lot more than my *minimum daily productivity*, but it's not like I want to do anything else more than I want to keep working on my story.  I want to get it done.

13:23.  I wonder if religions got the idea of torturing heretics from the idea that their gods torture the nonbelievers forever.  Did they think a taste of the pain to come could redeem souls?  Did they think that their gods' examples were to be emulated?  Would a faith that disbelieved in eternal torture ever produce a torturing inquisitor?

16:31.  I've been reading.  A few more pages of my book on Manichaeism, a few chapters of a Wings of Fire AU, but mostly, I read an unimpressive (albeit well-marketed) story on Royal Road.  I stopped because I thought of something that might be good for my next chapter of K&K.

17:33.  68,067.  768 words on the chapter.

18:41.  69,180.  1,881 words on the chapter.

18:59.  69,538.  2,239 words on the chapter.

19:43.  69,992.  2,693 words on the chapter.

20:24.  70,585.  3,276 words on the chapter.

20:36.  70,572.  3,263 words on the chapter.  I'm not trimming this one hard.  I'm just not.  I'm going to let my word count target lapse.  I drew out the chapter a little longer with summations at the end that accelerate the progress of the characters.  They need to advance faster!

20:41.  70,566.  3,257 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete, really this time!  0 words on the new chapter!  Long live the new chapter!  And, uh...  7,954 words of progress.  This is my 2023 record, again.

20:55.  Okay, I'm done writing for today.  I was as of my declaration that I'd hit my 2023 record.  I could actually continue though, which is kind of a strange feeling.  I started work at 6:53, stopped around 11:03, started again at 16:31, stopped at 20:41.  The first span was therefore 4 hours, 10 minutes long.  The second span was 4 hours, 10 minutes long.  I definitely didn't plan that.  I worked for 8 hours and 20 minutes in all, writing 7,954 words, or about 955 words per hour.
