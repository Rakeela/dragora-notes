Draft material:
1. My name is Ryan Norberg.  I'm an otherkin transhumanist from rural Illinois.  As otherkin, I have another name, but that's customarily for people I know more personally.  I had a horrible childhood surrounded by beauty; I loved the buildings and the forests in the area where I grew up, but I didn't love the people, many of whom were persistently unsafe to be around.  Despite that, I want to help everyone live forever, because I know living forever is what I want.  I want to be a biotech CEO, because I want to contribute to the advancement of medical science in this world, and I believe that the biotech field is currently controlled by organizations that are evil enough to deserve dismantling and inefficient enough that they can be displaced in the market.

2. My biggest personal interest in environmental science is the water cycle.  I believe there's plenty of water on Earth for all purposes, and it frustrates me that human ecological mismanagement so often manages to drain or pollute this resource, which has the potential to be absolutely abundant.  I find the importance of tree transpiration to atmospheric humidity to be a basic factor, but I'm unsure how widely people understand that forests contribute to the regional humidity of climates.  The importance of fungal spores (decomposers) to cloud formation is even more obscure.  I think some areas have ecologies that are suffering in ways which would get better if we could put down patches of decomposable materials sprayed with indigenous decomposers in order to cultivate wild mushroom growths whose spores would provide water nucleation sites for low-level cloud formation.  Not many people want to work with rot and fungus, so I wish we had robots for it.  Autofertilizing fungal dispensers could be used as helpful terraforming machines working wherever the smell won't bother people... but beyond the futuristic vision of an autoterraforming method, this is also a proposal for a low-skill labor that I think would be profitable for societies dependent on the water cycle wherever there are enough people with shovels willing to do it.  Every society where people have to eat is one with a dependency on the water cycle...

I'm from an agricultural area.  I'm no farm child, but I have some interest in it.  My interest in the water cycle started with an interest in depression-era economics in the region of my birth.  My father was a smart man in secret with stupid, violent friends.  I never understood his loyalty to them, but I treasured many long conversations with him in private, where he expressed a keen interest in economics and a conviction that there was a place in this world for every kind of person.  He was a rare egalitarian capitalist, and I tried for some years to carry on his ideology as best as I understood it.  Well, that didn't work, but one bit that has really stuck with me was the example of long-term land management which the government managed to implement across the Midwestern USA.  Afforestation projects stabilized the soil across the Midwest and transformed desertified farmland back into a richly productive region important to the global economy.  Instead of becoming an arid wasteland as so many mismanaged human-influenced ecologies have become, that land became a patchwork of farms and forests with a good climate where the importance of environmentalism to the local economy is underappreciated.  I believe that similar projects could and should be performed elsewhere in this world, and they'd be done better today with all we've learned in the decades since.  Although I do not plan a career in environmental sciences, I want to learn more about this subject in the name of good citizenship and supporting healthy long-term economic development.

I published this!  Very erroneously, as it doesn't meet the requirements in the instructions, and is worth at most 4 points.  I need to edit it to match requirements.
