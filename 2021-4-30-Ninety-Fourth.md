I just added a link to my [[medical-news-archive]] about something posted on the Quanta Magazine site about neuroimmunology:
https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-immune-system-protects-the-brain-20210428/

Immediately I found myself fantasizing about potential neural treatments.  If we could define which parts of the brain are least likely to be observed by the immune system, could we better treat tumors and pathogens in those regions?  Is there anything we could inject to those vicinities (for instance) which would better 'draw' the immune system when there's a problem that the immune system could fight?  Can we increase the rate at which pathogens are flushed from the more obscure bits of the brain?

Ultimately I think humanity is going to need to learn how to wash brains while they're in use.  Brainwashing!  ...I hate that word, it's so unfortunate.  Washing can be good.  If we could define the optimal state of the cerebrospinal fluid and wash it of impurities, I'm convinced that would have a rejuvenative effect.  Current aging would be pushed back for the people who have the most to gain from such a thing; for all recipients, aging would subsequently slow... for a few years.

The slowing of aging from this would be temporary.  If it wasn't being done as an ongoing effect, the treatment would have to be repeated.  I'm not sure at what interval it would need to be repeated; intuitively, I suspect the answer is "once per decade".  It's also not a total solution to life extension on its own, as it would "only" reduce the likelihood that people develop dementias and other mental illnesses from senescence.

To apply such a treatment in an ongoing way, some kind of artificial installation augmenting the brain's own ability to cleanse itself would be wonderful.  In the category of [[imagine-a-brain-implant]], I often think about chemical reservoirs.  One kind of chemical reservoir that would be for extracting chemicals rather than inserting chemicals would be a filtration implant for the cerebrospinal fluid.  This wouldn't eliminate the need for a recurrent procedure to maintain the rejuvenation effects, but it would simplify that procedure to draining the reservoir and replacing the filter.

In Stellaris, cyborgization and genetic modification are presented as competing technologies.  I'm not at all sure why that would be true.  Cybernetic implants are a test of biological skill, as is genetic modification.  Do optimal "cybertaker" genes exist?  What traits would define that, and what are their implications?

I'm always tempted to mod Stellaris.  For instance, I would expand the employment prospects of bio-trophies in rogue servitor governments, by getting rid of the "agri-drone" job and the "chronicle drone" job, compressing the machine and organic employment versions to "farmer" and "death chronicler" respectively, then opening up employability of bio-trophies in each.  Likewise, bio-trophies should be able to perform research, and to be employed as culture workers.  Some people would *want* to do these things, even were there no prestige and no material advantage in doing so, and so it would be part of their "job of being themselves".  They would then provide to their servant-mind the capacity of expanding these jobs a little bit faster, even if the servitor's robots would be theoretically superior at these tasks.

I tend to imagine the rogue servitor getting a kind of sanity-checking service from its bio-trophies, whether they know they're providing it or not, as the thoughts and preferences of the bio-trophies provide a constant source of calibration and intention for the servitor mind.
