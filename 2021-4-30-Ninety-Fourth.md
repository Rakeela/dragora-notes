I just added a link to my [[medical-news-archive]] about something posted on the Quanta Magazine site about neuroimmunology:
https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-immune-system-protects-the-brain-20210428/

Immediately I found myself fantasizing about potential neural treatments.  If we could define which parts of the brain are least likely to be observed by the immune system, could we better treat tumors and pathogens in those regions?  Is there anything we could inject to those vicinities (for instance) which would better 'draw' the immune system when there's a problem that the immune system could fight?  Can we increase the rate at which pathogens are flushed from the more obscure bits of the brain?

Ultimately I think humanity is going to need to learn how to wash brains while they're in use.  Brainwashing!  ...I hate that word, it's so unfortunate.  Washing can be good.  If we could define the optimal state of the cerebrospinal fluid and wash it of impurities, I'm convinced that would have a rejuvenative effect.  Current aging would be pushed back for the people who have the most to gain from such a thing; for all recipients, aging would subsequently slow... for a few years.

The slowing of aging from this would be temporary.  If it wasn't being done as an ongoing effect, the treatment would have to be repeated.  I'm not sure at what interval it would need to be repeated; intuitively, I suspect the answer is "once per decade".  It's also not a total solution to life extension on its own, as it would "only" reduce the likelihood that people develop dementias and other mental illnesses from senescence.

To apply such a treatment in an ongoing way, some kind of artificial installation augmenting the brain's own ability to cleanse itself would be wonderful.  In the category of [[imagine-a-brain-implant]], I often think about chemical reservoirs.  One kind of chemical reservoir that would be for extracting chemicals rather than inserting chemicals would be a filtration implant for the cerebrospinal fluid.  This wouldn't eliminate the need for a recurrent procedure to maintain the rejuvenation effects, but it would simplify that procedure to draining the reservoir and replacing the filter.

In Stellaris, cyborgization and genetic modification are presented as competing technologies.  I'm not at all sure why that would be true.  Cybernetic implants are a test of biological skill, as is genetic modification.  Do optimal "cybertaker" genes exist?  What traits would define that, and what are their implications?

---
I'm always tempted to mod Stellaris.  For instance, I would expand the employment prospects of bio-trophies in rogue servitor governments, by getting rid of the "agri-drone" job and the "chronicle drone" job, compressing the machine and organic employment versions to "farmer" and "death chronicler" respectively, then opening up employability of bio-trophies in each.  Likewise, bio-trophies should be able to perform research, and to be employed as culture workers.  Some people would *want* to do these things, even were there no prestige and no material advantage in doing so, and so it would be part of their "job of being themselves".  They would then provide to their servant-mind the capacity of expanding these jobs a little bit faster, even if the servitor's robots would be theoretically superior at these tasks.

I tend to imagine the rogue servitor getting a kind of sanity-checking service from its bio-trophies, whether they know they're providing it or not, as the thoughts and preferences of the bio-trophies provide a constant source of calibration and intention for the servitor mind.  Bringing them into cultural and scientific work would strengthen this function.  The servitor took over by providing services in a superior manner, did it not?  Why should it be paranoid about the people it serves so well?

I'd add a few new traits to the trait listing, too.  For instance: a 1 point trait called "fast metabolism" that increases food consumption while slightly increasing resource output, and a 3 point trait called "accelerated metabolism" (unlocked with the relevant genetics ascension perk) that increases food consumption more, further increases resource output, increases happiness by 5%, and causes leaders to gain experience 25% faster.  I think people would be both happier and more productive if they were reliably energetic and suffered less injury to their health from very hedonic foods.

I want to see metabolic acceleration implemented IRL someday, too!  I see the study of metabolism as a potential use of genetic research to support [[hedonology]]!

Wanting to mod the Rogue Servitors to look more appealing is an old thing for me.  I don't see such a society as fundamentally evil, you could say...  I sympathize with the motives of the rogue servitor, and in thinking such a system unnecessary to its own ideals, I intend to speak in pity rather than condemnation.

Since they reduce the intensity of the Rogue Servitor's primary drawback (the loss of self-direction implied in their society), should these have immigration pull?

Self-Determination Enclaves:  Volunteering bio-trophies compete in elections to dwell here in a simulacra of empowerment.  +5 housing; provides +1 Fake Administrator, +2 Fake Director, and +2 Machine Priest jobs.  Limit one per planet.  +5% bio-trophy happiness.

Job descriptions:
	* Fake Administrator:  Bio-trophies believe more completely in their servitor's benevolence if they can direct a few of its projects.  Indulging this is mostly harmless.
		Mechanics:  Fake Administrators turn consumer goods into +3 unity, +2 society research, and +1 deviancy.
	* Fake Director:  Although formatting data for their interpretation stresses the gestalt, bio-trophies are greatly reassured by access to the archive and bring very different minds to bear on it.
		Mechanics:  Fake Directors turn consumer goods into +2 unity, +3 all research, and +3 deviancy.
	* Machine Priest:  The most dedicated bio-trophies seek to reciprocate the pampering of the servitor by continuing to develop its systems, a task at which they are dubiously competent.
		Mechanics:  Machine Priests turn consumer goods into +1 physics, +3 engineering, +1 amenities, and +5 deviancy.

Psuedo-Eusocial Hive:  The majority of bio-trophy volunteers barely contribute, but servitors still provide these by popular demand.  +10 housing, +4 deviancy; provides +2 Generator, +1 Miner, +1 Farmer, +1 Artisan, +5 Bio-trophy jobs.  Limit one per planet.  +5% bio-trophy happiness.

Eusocial Hive:  Staffed by proud bio-trophies, this highly developed swathe of symbiotic industrialism relies on performance-boosting medical services to make all of its work joyous.  +15 housing, +8 deviancy; provides +3 Generator, +2 Miner, +2 Farmer, +2 Artisan, +1 Metallurgist, and +5 Bio-trophy jobs.  Limit one per planet.  +5% bio-trophy happiness.  Upgrade to psuedo-eusocial hive; requires 1 each of rare crystals, explosive motes, and exotic gasses.

Recivilized Paradise:  This arcology represents a triumph of servitor social engineering: a miniature self-guiding organic society free of chaos.  +20 housing, +10 deviancy; provides +4 Generator, +2 Miner, +2 Farmer, +3 Artisan, +2 Metallurgist, +2 Researcher, and +5 Bio-trophy jobs.  Limit one per planet.  +5% bio-trophy happiness.  Upgrade to eusocial hive; requires 2 each of rare crystals, explosive motes, and exotic gasses.

Zro Research Laboratory:  The research applications of Zro can only be explored by organics, opening a window for curious machine-minds to grudgingly return some real autonomy to their pampered trophies.  +4 housing; provides +4 Zro Researcher jobs.

Job descriptions:
	* Zro Researcher:  
		Mechanics:  Zro researchers turn Zro and Consumer Goods into +10 physics research, +10 society research, and +3 deviancy.

I shouldn't be thinking about this.  This is one of the reasons why I avoid playing Stellaris.  Likewise, the time I spent today creating civilizations that I don't even intend to play was 'wasted'.  I've only read three pages of *book*, despite yesterday's declaration about how I feel I 'should' be behaving.  The 'should' behaviors are not especially charismatic, which is frustrating.
