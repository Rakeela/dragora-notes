11:25.  Ugh, I'm feeling gradually worse with more time awake.  My face is hurting again.  I'm going to drink less caffeine than yesterday.

19:10.  I feel better than I felt yesterday, so I have no excuse for why I've been no more productive tonight than I was yesterday.

19:48.  I've been studying Slantworld for a while, and I'm struggling to come up with the next event in the story.

(This part added the next day.)  I barely used my treadmill for five minutes yesterday, but more to the point I forgot to record my wordcount.  66,215.  381 words of progress.  I feel like it was important progress, but how little of it!
