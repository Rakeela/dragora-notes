This one's still in black and white!  Akity and I skipped over it in the sequence for some reason.  I hope that it'll take its story very seriously.

I like Anguirrus' design, so I like seeing more of it.  The characters in this movie don't explain why they call it Anguirrus, they just say that's another word for ankylosaurus.  Ankylosauruses are described as carnivorous, and I'm pretty sure that's wrong.
