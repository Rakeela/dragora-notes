I'm watching it for King Ghidorah.

English dub has *terrible* voice-acting, apparently...

I was pretty sleepy while watching this one, so my impression was worsened by that, but the impression I got was that it was pretty terrible.  Ghidorah's part wasn't terrible.  The monsters drove the story from start to finish, but that meant the characterization and personal drama side was pretty weak.  The movie felt kind of forced.  Everything pushed through.  They did the odd cliche thing where troublemakers got axed by monsters, too.  I don't think of Mothra as a petty avenger with a bodycount...
