Watching another episode of The Ancient Magus Bride reminded me of being called family by Rethala, many years ago.  Chise's sense of being wanted somewhere, even dubiously...  I felt like that to the otherkin community.

There's a "wingsib" thing among otherkin that...  mostly missed me, not for lack of interest on my part.  "Chosen family" didn't work out for me at all.

Well, I certainly recommend The Ancient Magus Bride.  I don't particularly love how it handles dragons (it leaves them ugly, foolish, and limited), but it's such an inhuman story in general.  There are a lot of sentiments that it expresses which are excruciatingly rare elsewhere.
