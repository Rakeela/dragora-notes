0:26.  I have stayed up way too late courtesy of an interesting conversation on a Discord that I am active on.  Finally, someone overran the conversation and stalled it out, giving me a chance to feel emotionally that I had seen the whole thing.  I am finishing the night with one "Reese's Zero Sugar Miniature Cups" even though I don't really have room for it.  It's a little thing.  All the little violations of my diet!  Except I am still losing weight this time...

11:52.  It is nearly noon.  I have walked for an hour, but I have done no writing.  My mood is terrible today.

11:58.  13,618 words on the file.  1,705 words on the chapter.  Ugh, I don't want to write Kura right now.  I'd rather write Kaire.

12:05.  13,704.  1,791 on the chapter.  86 words of progress.  I added more dialogue.  A whole paragraph of dialogue, in a fluffless mental scene that already frustrated me for being indescribable.  Sigh.  I'm going to the store to buy more Mountain Dew.

12:34.  I just made a meal of some almonds.  Too many almonds.  What a cheat against my diet!

12:35.  It seems like the general rule is that weight is gained twice as fast as it is lost.  For every three days of eating, I must perform six days of dieting.  Eating two days and dieting five (regular meals and candy only on weekends) satisfies this requirement and lead to weight loss.  Eating two and dieting twelve (as on my prior cycle) satisfied this requirement even better.  Eating three and dieting fifteen (as on my ongoing cycle) is slightly better still, but also more frustrating as I must go six days to restore my weight from before I started.

13:27.  14,204.  2,260 on the chapter.  500 words of progress.

13:30.  I have eaten two more "Reese's Zero Sugar Miniature Cups".  I also ate a chunk of cocoa butter.  I should not keep eating...  Why am I failing my diet so hard today?  I will not have lost weight by the end of today at this rate.  I will keep tracking my "fast" so as to continue upholding my will to continue, but I will delete this "fast" when I am done.

14:07.  14,564.  2,509 words on the chapter.  860 words of progress.  I'm adding things for the sake of adding things now.  It kinda burns.  I need to bring the chapter to a close.  I've met the minimum and I could end it where it is, or I could spend another 200-300 words and add a breakthrough moment to (very slightly) cliffhang the next chapter.

14:11.  My gut hurts.  I want to be active in a way other than the treadmill.  I'm going to take another break and head outside for a bit.

15:05.  I have acquired another religion book.  "Essence of Universal Spirituality", by an open-minded taoist who claims to have studied all religions and to value all of them.  If there is anything that will shed light on the attraction of spirituality, perhaps this will!  But oh, I acquire books too fast.  If I read 10 books in a year, I acquire 40.  If I read 30 books in a year, I acquire 60.  It seems I can only reduce the gap, but never close it.

15:13.  Have I mentioned that I hate The Wearle?  This book is terrible.  I have read half of this book and I detest it.  It is a grind to make myself read further into it.  I do not want to rate it without having actually finished it.  I do not plan to ever read a second book in the same series.  The author's writing is grotesque.  Their world-building is interesting, but ill-planned.

16:25.  14,748.  2,733 words on the chapter.  1,130 words of progress.  This has been pretty hard.  I haven't worked as much as usual today.  Like two hours after the late start and all the breaks.  565 words an hour...

16:27.  Hey, 90k words divided by 565 is about 159.3.  159.3 divided by 24 is about 6.6.  It would only take me 6.6 days of steady work to write a novel at this pace, if it were my true pace of writing.

16:34.  I stopped, and stood here groaning while reading a few reviews on Goodreads.  Do I need painkillers?  They never seem to help much.  I'm done with writing Kura for the moment, now I need to write Kaire.  I wanted to write Kaire when I started writing a few hours ago, now I don't want to write Kaire.  Frustrating.

16:36.  I want to sit down and not be on my treadmill.  Sitting down doesn't have a good track record of actually helping, at least not before the eight hour mark.  I'm not consistently productive enough to reach that point.

17:19.  I bought a few more cookies, and especially some peanut butter brookies.  Now there's something I've never had before!  Yet I don't anticipate having one for the first time until 2023-05-27, because tomorrow I plan to eat a lentil wrap rather than a cookie for breakfast.  A lentil wrap should be more nutritious and will hopefully make me feel better than eating a cookie did today.

17.22.  Someone who I was vaguely acquainted with and failed to get along with just got banned from a transhumanist server that I'm on.  I'm kinda sad to see them go.  Sharing a server with them felt like a fresh chance.  It didn't seem right that I hadn't gotten along with them before.  Someone else had interfered that time and disrupted my relationship with them.  Now I guess, this time they were the unwelcome one, and there was no interference to speak of.  I do think I may have misidentified the person; I'm not exactly sure they're the same individual.

19:33.  15,967.  1,213 words on the chapter.  2,349 words of progress.

19:56.  16,233.  1,479 words on the chapter.  2,615 words of progress.  I've been watching an episode of Prehistoric Planet 2 while continuing to work on this.  

20:13.  16,239.  1,485 words on the chapter.  2,621 words of progress.  I got stalled wondering if gryphons have ears.  It's an important, permanent question that I don't want to establish wrongly.

20:48.  16,288.  1,534 words on the chapter.  2,670 words of progress.  I'm done for the night.
