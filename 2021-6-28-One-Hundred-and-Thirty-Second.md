I'm working on my [[Business-Ambitions]] today.

I get to play with Legos and call it productivity.  I haven't done anything with Legos since I was quite young!  I was never good with Legos.  My deficits in spatial planning were apparent early.  That this is technically disadvantageous is here apparent!

This could take all day...  How do I represent the different components in this system?

...I have almost immediately run out of long thin pieces.  Tch.

I have a partial model, but I don't know what I've gained by making it.  Maybe if I translate it into geometric measures, I can scale it and learn the size of the parts that I need to order in order to build it?  I'm not sure how this works, but I need to figure it out.
