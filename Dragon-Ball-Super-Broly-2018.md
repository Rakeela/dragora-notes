Dates Rewatched:  Never

I forgot to make a note of watching the movie until it was over.  It held my attention... a little too well.  Very shiny.  It kept me from getting much progress in my writing.  I like that I can recognize the characterization of the characters in the Abridged series.  They didn't bring that stuff out of nothing.
