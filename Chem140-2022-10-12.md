Oh dear god I didn't pay attention in class, and there was something actually taught that I didn't know.

Frequency (nu, v) = no of wave cycles / 1 second
1/s = Hz
lambda = wavelength; I can't type the lambda symbol, but it looks like a bent line with an extra leg leading down.

The teacher recommends doing page 121.  These are difficult...  I'm going to take some pictures so I can study the board at home.
