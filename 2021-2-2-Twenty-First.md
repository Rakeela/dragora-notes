I wish people were better at asking questions about what they don't understand.  What I wrote about where I'd like to cite a major offshore system...  My unspeaking audience saw that, and didn't understand.  The commentary that I "don't" get isn't appropriate, not because of the content, but because of the dishonesty with which it is presented.  I don't want to have to keep cutting connections with authoritarian artists.  I know a lot of that is inevitable because I was sexually exploited by artistically talented people and I'm nowhere near wealthy enough to be allowed to have a sexual grievance against abuses by any artist (cultural figures who violate the privacy of unimportant people are allowed to reject them as 'crazy fans'), but someday I want art to be a liberal endeavor again like it seemed to be in my youth.  Artists should value integrity.  It shouldn't be an excuse for "liberals" (none of whom actually are) to "watch back" as though anyone who took notice of their art were fair game for abuses.  That's just organized crime.  It's lame.

Privacy violation is a sex crime.  It is especially a sex crime in my case, because of what I went through that put my privacy on the chopping block.  Yet I see it that way broadly; inquisition is the hallmark of sex crimes and the most visible signifier that they are rampant in a society.  Violating the privacy of others is a way to learn how to violate their consent, whether that's by learning when they're vulnerable, or just by learning what lies you need to tell them.  It's a necessary conduct of people who want to get away with what they're doing.

I guess I'm bemoaning the loss of my naivety about a social environment that was never actually trustworthy, but that hurts, too.  Society needs to learn that the inquisitorial people who judge everything and yet can't talk about their impressions are fundamentally unhelpful to science and social harmony.  It's important to be able to talk honestly about why specific motivations arise, and to *engage* with people of interest.

I think this would get better with more obligate read-receipting on the internet.  If people were informed more exactly of traffic, it wouldn't be possible to notice people without being noticed to notice them.  IRL social contact works that way, and for that matter so does using LOOK commands at people on a MUCK.  I believe a system where people openly exchanged read receipts while browsing the internet would make it a healthier social space - especially on social media platforms.  I wouldn't implement it as a universal regulatory compulsion... I'd give it to a new network.  It's another of a category of complaints I've made over time, which is "I wish we had more than one internet serving the public," though this one at least might be theoretically possible to implement as simply a new social media platform.  It would give people an environment where they can see and be seen, allowing clear mutual noticing to precede interactions, as if people were attending a party and interacting with people there.

It would give people a place to go if their life has given them cause to be upset by falsified non-observation.  My scientific ambitions put me in an unusually good position to say that it can happen, has happened, and doubtless will continue to happen... yet I don't believe it should happen.  Voluntary cessation of privacy is a good function that's worth rewarding and enabling in society.  Forcible cessation of privacy is just a kind of criminality.
