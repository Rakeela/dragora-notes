Starting witht 1,582 on the file.  I'll work on this one a little further and then open a new one.  The lower quota has freed me from massive files, I think.  I was so stressed during nanowrimo.

I need 939 words today.

1,741 on the file.  159 words of progress, 780 words to go.  Starting a new file.

988 words on the new file.  208 words over the quota.  I feel like I write myself into a fresh corner every day, and the next day I always write myself out of it.
