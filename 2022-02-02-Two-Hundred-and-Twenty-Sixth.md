One of my chronic pain sources has been clarified into a diagnosis:  Nervous Intermedius Neuralgia.  This is the one that I treat with carbamazepine.  It weakened when I took 100 mg of carbamazepine.  It went away when I took 200 mg.  I was supposed to take 300 mg, but Kistaro told me to stop and cut that back to 200 mg again, claiming that it made me too sleepy.

I had a period of exhaustion and sleepiness that was awful when I ran out of carbamazepine, and the "intermedius neuralgia" pain (across the side of my head, between my ear and my jaw) started to come back.  It went away again when I managed to get a refill on my prescription.
