14:14.  My game of LCS has gotten pretty dull to play.  It's a won game, but it's a slow win.  Ironically, I've discovered that my zero-crimes strategy leaves CEO Salaries viewpoints mostly unshifted, so the last stance to become popular is the idea of restraining the growth of CEO salaries.

16:37.  Let's actually do some editing.  I can get at least a chapter done tonight.

17:10.  I did a bit of editing on Kura and Kaire.  I'm not going to score that for today; I didn't change much.

17:12.  Credit 6 words.

17:16.  Credit 13 words.

17:18.  Credit 44 words.

17:19.  Credit 4,125 words editing.  Tallying...  349 words of progress.

20:15.  I'm being like a rich person...  Very bad productivity, not returning much value to society.  I have plenty of luxuries in my life, too.  Working class people are worth more.  Higher productivity, better return to society.  They get fewer luxuries.  This society is so backwards.
