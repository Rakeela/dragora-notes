There was a time in my life when everything in my life was supposed to be about sex, and whenever I tried to complain, people treated me as dishonest.  I was always treated as the one begging for sex.  Eventually, I started cracking jokes about it.  I'd speak of it and then back off quickly if I got a positive response.  Speak up, back off.  Speak up, back off.  I backed off quicker and quicker over time until eventually, my engagement was parodic (fetishized premature ejactulation) and my withdrawals were so quick as to be undeniable.

Once I was no longer sexually available...  I was treated as sour grapesing because people rejected me.  They did not.  I stopped being someone who could be framed as lusting when I was backing off instantly.

I feel timeless and lost in the winter.  Even though I spend much of my time indoors, the dark outside still affects me.  It is simultaneously as though life lasts forever and as though death is at hand; I am both caught in a moment and lost in thought.

I record this thought mostly because it seems like poetry, and I need to... reclaim my ability to write poetry.  If ever I can.  I wrote poetry in adolescence only in desperation to express what I couldn't express.  The emotions that people didn't believe I had... were not understood in my poems either.
