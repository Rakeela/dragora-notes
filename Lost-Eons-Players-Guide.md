#Lost-Eons-Players-Guide

If I didn't kind of get it, I'd complain that this is too chaotic to use.  It's full of random tables.  The [[Lost-Eons-GMs-Tools]] are even worse.  So much chaos, right?  Nothing hangs together?  The random bobs are just suggestions.  This game thrives on cooperative minds with initiative.  Vibe with what it throws at you, then rewrite the scene.

I only kind of get it.  I don't know if I could ever fully get it.  I'm not sure I'm the kind of person who could play this game.  It's fascinating to think about.  I wonder if I'll ever meet anyone else who has played it.

It's still chaotic, too.  Mutations aplenty seem inclined to accumulate while playing.  What do you do with that?  How do you get rid of them?  Are all the players supposed to be so hyper-accepting that they thrill with every alteration?  Because I get that vibe from the material, and I wonder at it.  If you play it in campaign mode, it's got to get impractical.

I have a qualm with the skill system, too.  How far do skill dice upgrade?  Do players ever get extra dice?  I don't think they necessarily need them, I'm just wondering.

Including magic in this setting is a strange decision that I've seen plenty of times.  I just think of it like Numenera: everything has been infused with advanced technology and then misunderstood extensively.  The technology is so user-friendly that it still does things when used ignorantly.  Except in this case, it also mutates people.  Minor detrimental mutations all over if people insist on using it.  That goes back to my earlier thought about mutations.  Does everyone end up with tentacles in this game?  Would it be valid to skip the table and just morph into more of a bird or reptile every time, playing out a self-gratifying fantasy?

The Psych archetype's talent is scary.  Always knowing when people are lying?  Who could live like that?  I suss out lies too often as-is.  I know the pain of going along with an obvious lie and "falling for" things just because it hurts even more to call out the lie.  I walked down that path with one of my exes, and hopefully I'll someday look on this line while forgetting what I meant.  Anyways, it could be hard to GM for, hard to play for.  If a Psych is in the party, NPCs don't get to lie without revealing something huge about their character every time.  Every lie becomes an obvious one and it becomes a loose thread to pick at.
