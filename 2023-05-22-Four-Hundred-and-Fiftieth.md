6:40.  I want to play Stellaris instead of working, and I think I really will.  I have been miserable in the evenings lately and I haven't wanted to play things in time that 'should' be time off.  By contrast, evenings when I'm working late to catch up on my quota have generally been fine.  By playing the game when I want to play it and then working when I want to work, I should still meet quota today.  While I'm here though, and before I start playing anything, I'm going to leave a note to myself: I need to extend the prologue in Kura and Kaire to give a divine perspective on each character.

6:46.  In my Stellaris game, I've absorbed most of the slaver empires on the map.  There's one remainder.  I'm going to go conquer it.

9:12.  I won that Stellaris game, but no Victorious achievement.  I had delayed starting a new game because I wanted that achievement.  It seems to be bugged.  I've filed a bug report and uploaded the save that should've won.

9:26.  That eclair when I woke up was pretty good, but four hours later I have no fond memories of it.  It's not like the cookies that I adore.  I'm so totally unsatisfied, that I have just eaten one of my cookies.  Now I'll be content to eat nothing more today... though an eclair and a cookie is already far too much to eat.

10:17.  I thought sitting down would make it so that I could work, but it didn't.  The problem isn't just that my legs are sore.  I'm also not sure what to write next.  I need a kobold god to match Kaire's gryphon god.

10:18.  3,950 words on the file.  592 words on the chapter.  All chapters should be between 2,500 and 3,000 words long.

11:45.  4,983.  1,625 words on the chapter.  1,033 words of progress.  This is going fairly well.

12:20.  5,778.  2,420 words on the chapter.  1,828 words of progress.  That's quota, but there's much left to do before I forget my place in this material.

12:39.  2,721 words on the chapter.  I'm in the right range now.

13:12.  6,304.  2,354 words of progress.

13:14.  Chapter 2 is 2,892 words long.  I'm pretty good at hitting word targets.

13:40.  6,622.  2,672 words of progress.  That's a good day of work.

15:15.  7,588.  970 words on the chapter.  3,638 words of progress.

16:10.  9,064.  2,446 words on the chapter.  5,114 words of progress.  Hm.  I thought the chapter was complete at this point, but it looks like I came up a little shy of my word count.

16:19.  9,104.  2,486 words on the chapter.  5,154 words of progress.  Picking over a chapter looking for places to *expand* it is surprisingly unpleasant.  I'm so used to editing for brevity.  Editing to add feels weird.

16:33.  9,304.  2,686 words on the chapter.  5,354 words of progress.  Now that's a good day of work!  This is a really high word count for me!  I can see that I've been working for a little more than six hours.

16:36.  I've just rechecked my 2023 records and I found that this is my 2023 record for highest wordcount.  It's not my all-time high score, because I once wrote 40k words in three days, but it's really high.

16:44.  9,304.  I did some edits and I'm amused to see that they exactly balanced out.

17:19.  Ugh.  I hate The Wearle.  It's fucking around with dung.  That's one of my cardinal sins of dragon writing.  Dragons should be clean.

17:23.  There's too much bleeding, too.  That's a lesser complaint, but it's still substantial.  My rating plunges when dung is in the writing.  It wavers when dragons bleed.

18:11.  Peeps have a freshness period tighter than their use-by implies.  The Peeps I already have are harder than they were.  No, I didn't just eat any.  I've eaten 5 since I stockpiled though, and it was already noticable then.

18:14.  I did just eat some cheese and mayo.  Nom nom nom.  I stopped myself because I wasn't eating it delicately the way I should.  I wasn't properly appreciating it.

18:55.  I recruited another prereader for Ekis' Travelogue on the 19th.  I should've recorded this then.  I also exposed my draft to a bunch of people.  I need to check in on what's happened to it since.

19:56.  I am watching "Prehistoric Planet 2", and there's no way that researchers identified some of this stuff.

20:48.  Whee, I spent ten minutes playing "Artifracture" on Flight Rising.
