8:25.  Yesterday's treadmill distance was 3.6 miles.  652 kcal.  13,734 steps.  2 hours, 53 minutes, 58 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.

8:52.  I kinda freaked out and ate a bunch of sweets yesterday.  I thought about something.  I never ate meat to punish the voices in my head.  I've only done that with sweets.  This, I think, reflects a fundamental difference in my ethical evaluation of these meals.  I don't see sweets as intrinsically unethical the way I see meat as intrinsically unethical.

9:30.  I see eating sweets as self-harming behavior, but I don't see self-harming behavior as unethical.  So I'm just going to eat a bit more.  I have some cotton candy I stashed away to eat in the off-season.  I'll eat that now.

9:33.  This cotton candy is comically awful.  I'm enjoying it anyways somehow.

9:42.  I finished the cotton candy.  That was just amazingly too sweet.  Haha.

10:52.  I didn't actually just eat 18 York Peppermint Patties Zero Sugar as reported by my #Candy-Vault, but I only have 4 left in the pack.  Wait.  Maybe I really should reduce the main number instead of decrementing the count when I discover errors in my tracking.
