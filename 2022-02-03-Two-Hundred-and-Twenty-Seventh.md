Not too long ago now, I had the pleasure of eating a pair of truly exceptional donuts, and I discovered thereby the *best* local bakery for donuts.  I'm so tempted to go eat a donut.  I usually let myself eat a small amount every day and say that I'm still fasting, as long as my calorie consumption stays low enough.

I'm reading about Athenian condemnations of luxury in hopes of gleaning inspiration for a story that I'm writing, and it's a miserable subject.  The ancient Greeks come off as so *hateful* of each other.  No wonder they were constantly at war.  This makes me want a donut.  It's such a luxury food, in that it has so little value for sustenance.

There's a local donut place that isn't any good at making donuts.  They specialize in making donuts.  They make nothing *but* donuts.  They have good branding and a local supply contract with the nearest grocery store chain to make *lots* of donuts.  And... they suck.  Their donuts gave me a bad impression of donuts in general.  I was so sure that a competently-branded and productive specialist shop would have good donuts.  When their donuts were bad, I thought I didn't like donuts at all.

Gosh, I sure wish I could just go six miles to that place with the GOOD donuts.  Maybe next week.

I want to have a virtual food stockpile someday.  I'm a glutton.  I want to eat.  Yet I want to be uploaded to a virtual environment where I can eat constantly while doing other stuff and not *die* of over-eating.  I want to be able to try the bad donuts and the good donuts side-by-side without that being a horrible sin of over-eating.  I want to feel my gut distended by eating too many donuts without packing on the kilos.

My weight is what I consider under control.  I control it by feasting-and-fasting patterns of food consumption.  I'm not hideously fat.  Nevertheless...  Maybe I should commission a picture of myself as a fat dragon.  Just for virtualization points.
