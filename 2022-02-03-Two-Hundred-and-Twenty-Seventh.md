Not too long ago now, I had the pleasure of eating a pair of truly exceptional donuts, and I discovered thereby the *best* local bakery for donuts.  I'm so tempted to go eat a donut.  I usually let myself eat a small amount every day and say that I'm still fasting, as long as my calorie consumption stays low enough.

I'm reading about Athenian condemnations of luxury in hopes of gleaning inspiration for a story that I'm writing, and it's a miserable subject.  The ancient Greeks come off as so *hateful* of each other.  No wonder they were constantly at war.  This makes me want a donut.  It's such a luxury food, in that it has so little value for sustenance.
