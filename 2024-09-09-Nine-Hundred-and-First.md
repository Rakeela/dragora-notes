6:13.  

6:31.  6,212.

6:36.  6,191.  Rebase.

8:24.  6,869.  This is not going easily.  I need a break.  I'm going to play Democratic Socialism Simulator.

9:39.  Back from Democratic Socialism Simulator.

10:06.  8,180.  1,968 words of progress.  I'm going to take a break.

11:20.  I am back.  I walked to the nearest Subway, ate a footlong veggie sub and a footlong pretzel, then came back.  I read a bit more of Hegel, but Hegel seems direly inept.

11:35.  8,270.  I don't feel very good.  I'm unfocused, loose, and uncomfortable.

13:01.  8,763.  I have a headache.  I still don't feel very good, though I'm more comfortable than I was in some ways.

17:52.  Another round of Democratic Socialism Simulator.

19:25.  So I didn't keep playing that game past when I earlier said I was.  By "Another round" I meant "I finished another round".  I did other stuff after that.  I went to the store, for instance.  I bought grapefruit energy drinks and pumpkin spice hummus.  I shouldn't eat that for a few days.

20:54.  10,512.  4,300 words of progress.  Been working since the last timepoint.  I've been at my desk for most of the time since I woke up.  Now it's time to go to bed again.  11.6 miles.  2,073 kcal.  43,458 steps.  9 hours, 24 minutes, and 17 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.
