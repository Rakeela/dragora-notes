I rarely reread my old day post logs.  Who am I writing these for?  Of course, lately I'm writing them to record Nanowrimo progress.

The file that I'm working on is starting at 3514 words.  It should be done at this wordcount, but I'm looking at it and it's not.  It's not at an appropriate ending point.

Gosh, I'm going to have so much editing to do later on.  These scenes are overweight and ugly.  I haven't given them nifty scene names like I usually do, either.  They're just "First Wrimo Scene", "Second Wrimo Scene", and so forth until the current one, which is "Fifth Wrimo Scene".  Most of my work today should land on "Sixth Wrimo Scene" once I figure out how to wrap up the scene file starting at 3514 words.

4473 on the file.  This is too much on one scene-file...  Ugh, editing is going to be a pain in the ass...  959 words of progress, 708 words to go.

4848 on the file.  1,334 words of progress, 333 words to go.

5,349 on the file.  1,835 words of progress, -168 to go.  Done!
