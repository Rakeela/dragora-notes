I have a sub-archive started for a separate project.  The Stan Brigade have already informed me that they can see what I'm "hiding", and they've begun doing their rape dances trying to steal the idea somehow so that it won't seem creative and novel.  "Nothing you do will EVER be important," was rolled out against me for daring to oppose authoritarianism in a non-tribal way.  -_-

Ideas are non-rival (multiple people can have the same idea without devaluing it), but they aren't *free*.  If we fail to reward the sources of ideas, society starts falling apart in hatred and warfare rather than having ideas and moving forward.

We need a Glasswall.  I don't mind someone 'stealing' an idea so much if they're forced to attribute it.  A lot of the times when abusive people Stanning me have tried to 'test' my politeness by raping off my ideas and reminding me that I'm being tested on my obedience, they've been doing something which I would've engaged with very politely (according to the value of the idea) had the interaction been consensual *or* transparent.  I was treated as a 'cactus person' for opposing rape culture, which is just bogus.

I'm NOT misusing the phrase 'rape culture'; I was pressured into years of cybersexual performances for Stan the Omniscient.  The carrot-and-stick system pointed at me was ultimately all stick.  I never would've given over sexual consent if I knew the day I withdrew sexual consent would see me marked a rapist.  I am not a rapist; I am not even sexually interested in humans!
