I've been thinking about [[Monster-Girl-Encyclopedia]] again.

I've also been poking at AI Dungeon.  Should I give that its own card?  I feel I should, but I can't quite bring myself to do it.  It *has* had an influence on me.  It gave me Xenia, a character I haven't used much in writing yet, but who I have already commissioned a major picture of that I think will end up framed on my wall.

Back to Monster Girl Encyclopedia.  The thing with MGE is that it is fap-bait.  Absolutely.  I wrote a huge take-down of it and I stand by every word, but yet I stand here in *envy* of people who can take it straightforwardly.  Somewhat confused envy, but envy nonetheless.

I'm still aghast at the basic injustice that the book and the book's inversion would both be considered horrifically narcissistic male fantasies... and yet that... just doesn't bother most people who enjoy it.  Do I *gain something* from having this thought, or is this thought just a *loss of fun*?  Is the thought a gem or an injury?  Of course, it is My Thought (M-T), and moreover it is My Grand Complaint Against Society (M-GCAS), and so I'm loathe to call it an injury... but I'm also not willing to condemn men who masturbate to it.  There's nothing *wrong* with that behavior.

Likewise, people use AI Dungeon for porn.  I've done it myself!  If I remember my motives correctly, *if* I do, I felt that I had to test it.  I had to know.  Was it truly the tool that I had longed for hopelessly, as one who was drowning in an ERP scene that stressed me to misery?  Was AI Dungeon truly the unexpected ad-libs engine that could do "ERP" with less commitment on the part of the player?  Answer:  Yes, it can.  I can wring results out of AI Dungeon that are quite fit-for-purpose.

The conjunction of these two subjects, that people use AI Dungeon for Monster Girl porn, is what I've actually been thinking about.  There are tons and tons of monster girl scenarios on AI Dungeon.  I can't use them.  I can't imagine using them.  I once tried writing a story about a guy getting raped by monster girls and it was a weird, horrible fight with the AI.  Like it didn't really understand that being raped is *not desirable for men*.  Now I'm just stuck on that thought.  I can't get into *any* of the porn scenes.  There's a sort of "flat what" in my responses, ever since.  I don't want to do it as a drama and I can only imagine it as a trauma.

Anyways, I don't masturbate enough.  Once a day is healthy, but hard to achieve.  I envy people with less broken attitudes to porn than my own.
