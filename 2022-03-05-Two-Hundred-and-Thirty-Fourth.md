We need to cure allergies.  I think the cure for schizophrenia might be to systematically cure allergies in the sufferers of it.  It's just a conjecture at this point, but I believe that allergy-curing protocols *can* be invented.  Once invented, the conjecture about how to cure schizophrenia can be upgraded to a hypothesis and tested on sufferers of schizophrenia.

It's an immune disorder.  I keep thinking that.  I'm going to study to become an immunologist if I can.
