#Escaflowne-2000

Date First Watched:  2022-12-17
Dates Rewatched:  Never

No confusion this time.  I've definitely never seen this.

I don't think I like it.  Today is a bad day for movie-watching.  At least there are anthro characters.

I haven't been enjoying the movie enough to pay attention, so I've missed an awful lot of it.
