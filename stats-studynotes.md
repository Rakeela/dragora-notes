{Transcribed from Textbook}
The five-number summary is not the most common numerical description of a distribution. Rather, that distinction belongs to the combination of the mean (a measure of center) and the standard deviation (a measure of spread). The standard deviation and its square value, the variance, measure spread by looking at how far the observations are from their mean.

{Transcribed from Textbook}
The variance s^2 of a sample set of observations is an average of the squares of the deviations of the observations from their mean.
{Deviation presumably meaning distance.  If you calculate all of the distances from the mean in the sample, square them, and divide sigma of the sequence by the count of the sequence (which is to say take the mean of the squared distances), you get the variance.  If I've understood the math this is proposing.}
{Error preserved in above, see correction two paragraphs down.}

{Paraphrased from Textbook}
A sample's standard deviation is the square root of the sample's variance.
{If you calculate the variance as above, then squoot it, you get the width of the standard deviations in the sample set.}

{There's something here about an n-1 calculation that I don't quite understand.  Still thinking about it.  Something to do with x-with-a-line-atop-it?}
{Transcribed from Textbook}
Only n-1 of the squared deviations in a sample can vary freely once we know x-with-a-line-atop-it, and we find their average by dividing the total by n-1.  This adjustment is necessary to give the sample variance important mathematical properties that will be addressed in later chapters on statistical inference.
{x-with-a-line-atop-it, to refresh, is another way to say the mathematical mean.  So this says, "Only n-1 of the squared deviations in a sample can vary freely once we know their mathematical mean," and I can't say I understand that.  Is it because the central deviation is always centered on the mean?}
{Correcting the above calculation regarding the calculation of the variance, it appears that you should calculate all of the distances from the mean in the sample, square them, and then divide sigma of the sequence the count of the sequence minus 1 in order to get the variance.}
