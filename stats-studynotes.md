{Transcribed from Textbook}
The five-number summary is not the most common numerical description of a distribution. Rather, that distinction belongs to the combination of the mean (a measure of center) and the standard deviation (a measure of spread). The standard deviation and its square value, the variance, measure spread by looking at how far the observations are from their mean.

{Transcribed from Textbook}
The variance s^2 of a sample set of observations is an average of the squares of the deviations of the observations from their mean.
{Deviation presumably meaning distance.  If you calculate all of the distances from the mean in the sample, square them, and divide sigma of the sequence by the count of the sequence (which is to say take the mean of the squared distances), you get the variance.  If I've understood the math this is proposing.}

{Paraphrased from Textbook}
A sample's standard deviation is the square root of the sample's variance.
{If you calculate the variance as above, then squoot it, you get the width of the standard deviations in the sample set.}

{There's something here about an n-1 calculation that I don't quite understand.  Still thinking about it.}
