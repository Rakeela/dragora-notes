Morning weigh-in: 255.0 pounds.  Already down a pound from last night, somehow.

88,344 words on the file.  Doing a bit of tweaking.  I feel like yesterday's editing wasn't my best work, so I'm not editing-by-chapter this time.  I'm just repoking at what I did yesterday.  88,199 words on the file.  Giving Ekis' a chirpy, enthusiastic voice helps me trim down her dialogue.  She says things with brevity!  That helps me practice brevity, too.  Anyways.  I trimmed 145 words.  7,521 words left on my 15k trim target.

5,365 words on the chapter.  4,459 words on the chapter.  906 words trimmed.  6,615 words left on my 15k trim target.  I cut out mention of a later subplot that I think is going to be removed from the draft.  Except taking it away will destroy most of what remains of the draft!  There are 18,721 words left on the draft.  I'm not sure how many of them will survive.  From here on out, cutting will be brutal.  Entire chapters will be destroyed.

I have been drinking through a bottle of rum.  It's absolutely terrible.  It's not the rum's fault.  I think the rum tastes fine for rum.  I just don't like alcohol.  I'm only drinking it for my health.  Small quantities every day while the bottle lasts.

Evening weigh-in:  252.7 pounds.  Bit of a fast drop.  I'll drink more water.

I'm still exercising.  I took a trip to Woodinville on my bike.  That's exercise too, but I can't score it.  I can't get any more treadmill time for tonight though, with midnight coming up in twenty minutes.  So I walked 8 miles, burning an estimated 1,443 kcal across 6 hours, 22 minutes, and 49 seconds.  I took 28,587 steps.  The summary estimates my speed at 1.2 mph.
