# Session 4 Notes

{Alright, this worked well last time.  I'll try it again this time.}
---

{Whoops, six minutes late.  Hm.  It looks like there's a fair chance I haven't missed anything.  The teacher is talking about how to alculate the mean and five number summary from a stem and leaf plot, which I already know how to do.}
{Skipping the first slide transcription.}
{Can't hear the teacher at all...  I need to get my better headphones for this.}
{There.  Better headphones.  Now I can hear the teacher.  She's got another slide up on screen.  It's number of pets vs number of students.  I don't feel like I would gain much from transcribing this slide, but apparently there are 2 students who don't have pets, 7 students who have 1 pet, 3 students who have 2 pets, 1 student who has 3 pets, and 2 students who have 4 pets.}
{This currently appears to be getting used for five number summary generation.  The teacher is just presenting another of the data representations used in the homework.  I get the impression from this class that I can learn enough to do the homework by attending all of the classes.}
