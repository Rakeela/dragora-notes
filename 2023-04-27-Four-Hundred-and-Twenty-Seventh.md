I went to Woodinville and bought still more chocolates from the World Market there.  Their stock is mostly the same as the nearby World Market, so I was disappointed not to acquire the white chocolate orange that I wanted to get.  I did however get some cotton candy, and I found a party store out there with cotton candy supplies.  That should be a good regular source for cotton candy!

I've been thinking excited thoughts about my [[Candy-Vault]].  This is my hoard!  This is what I love to gather on Earth!  And I shouldn't eat my hoard too quickly.

I'm intending to finish Hidden Worldviews today.  He's into the Christian worldview now.  Page 187 rehashes his shoddy claim that other worldviews "absolutize" various things.  His take on individualism remains unempathetic.  His take on relativism remains ignorant.  His take on naturalism remains unempathetic.

Page 205, "Without such a God, it is difficult to understand why anyone would expect the world to improve."  Ugh.  UGGGH.  This guy's empathy for non-Christians is restricted.  He's obviously a reasonable, intelligent, and even idealistic person, but the closest he gets to acknowledging the universality of idealism is to call humanism "Christianity without God" earlier in the book.

His arguments in favour of tradition just strike me as terribly misguided.  Tradition produces uncompassionate hegemonies.  Traditions *of* compassion, which Christianity does not even authentically have despite claiming to, are merely the least odious of a bad means of interacting with the world.

This guy asserts that Christians are not to believe themselves God, which surprises me.  I thought the omnipresence of God throughout Creation was one of Christianity's doctrines.

Page 217, "Can you squeeze humility out of individualism, which puts me at the center of the universe?"  Yes.  Easily.  This guy sees pride and selfishness where he shouldn't.  It's a sign of the limits of his understanding, and I think his Christianity forms the roadblock preventing him from understanding other peoples' thoughts.

Oh god.  He invokes integrity at the end.  His empathy is weak, his ignorance is strong, but he invokes integrity.

That was a stressful and difficult read, but I finally cleared it.  I was hoping for cultural insight that I could use in my writing, but dealing with the cultural context of a dominant cultural movement that wants to restrict the rights of innocents made it very difficult.  I felt like this guy's judgements and understandings were representative of a great mass of very difficult people.  I'm glad I don't write about Christians in my stories.
