Commentary:  Probably a good idea if it can be arranged.  I do think that tax-dodging by private institutions exceeds efficiency.  International tax collection cooperation is important in a global economy.  The complaints about slow innoculations are also significant.  It's disappointing that public institutions around the world aren't ready for this task, because COVID-19 is like a trial run for more serious pandemic risks that are also very real.  We would have a wealthier, stabler world if humanity could efficiently innoculate people when disease threats arise.
