Commentary:  Probably a good idea if it can be arranged.  I do think that tax-dodging by private institutions exceeds efficiency.  International tax collection cooperation is important in a global economy.  The complaints about slow innoculations are also significant.  It's disappointing that public institutions around the world aren't ready for this task, because COVID-19 is like a trial run for more serious pandemic risks that are also very real.  We would have a wealthier, stabler world if humanity could efficiently innoculate people when disease threats arise.

Commentary:  I'm appalled that local governments in the 50s and 60s could justify breaking up impoverished communities and displacing people to install highways.  The presence of the highway is an example of a source of structural inequality as well, as it is a miserable pollution source.  When forcing proximity to such a structure on people with no other choices *while* damaging their communities, I would expect to see a generational impairment of productivity.  Also, I almost never install highways in city simulators.  Traffic is an urban environmentalism problem, and highways make the urban environmentalism problems worse rather than better.
