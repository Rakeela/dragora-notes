Chapter 16: Carboxylic Acids and Esters

A carboxylic acid contains a carboxyl group, which consists of a hydroxyl group -OH attached to the carbon in a carbonyl group C=O.  (Commentary:  It's a carbonyl group bonded to an alcohol group.)

In the IUPAC names of carboxylic acids, the e in the alkane name is replaced with oic acid.  (The example is given of methane being carboxylized methanoic acid, the smallest carboxylic acid.  The example is given of ethane being carboxylized to ethanoic acid.)

Substituents are numbered from the carboxyl, which is carbon 1.  (The example is given of 2 methylpropanoic acid, which has a methyl -CH3 group on carbon 2.  The esxample is given of 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, which has a hydroxyl -OH group on carbon 3.)

As before, for benzoic acid, the placement of the substituents is shown using the prefixes ortho, meta, and para.  (The example is given of 4-aminobenzoic acid, which is para-aminobenzoic acid, or PABA.  It has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and an amino group at position 4.  The example is also given of 3,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, which has substituents at 1, 3, and 4, and therefore does not have a o/m/p common name.)

Many carboxylic acids are still named by their common names, which use prefixes form-, acet-, propion-, butyr-.  When using the common names, the greek letters alpha, beta, and gamma are assigned to the carbons adjacent to the carboxyl carbon.  (The example is given of 3-methylbutanoic acid, which is beta-methylbutyric acid.)  (Commentary:  The -oic ending becomes an -ic ending, too.)

A red ant sting contains methanoic acid (aka formic acid) that irritates the skin.  The sour taste of vinegar is due to ethanoic acid (acetic acid).  (Commentary:  With two carbons, the common prefix is acet-.)

Carboxylic acids can be prepared from primary alcohols or aldehydes.  From the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids.  (The example is given of ethanol (aka ethyl alcohol) oxidizing to ethanal (aka acetaldehyde) and then oxidizing again to ethanoic acid (aka acetic acid).). Ethanol in wine is oxidized by oxygen in the air, converting the primary alcohol to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid, the carboxylic acid in vinegar.

Alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are found in fruits, milk, and sugar cane.  The examples are given of glycolic acid (from sugar cane), lactic acid (from sour milk), tartaric acid (from grapes), malic acid (from apples), and citric acid (from citrus fruits).  They are naturally occurring carboxylic acids with a hydroxyl group on the carbon atom that is adjacent to the carboxyl group.

Dermatologists have been using products with high concentrations (20-70%) of AHAs to remove acne scars and in skin peels to reduce irregular pigmentation and age spots.  Several different hydroxy acids may be found in skin care products singly or in combination.

16.2 Properties of Carboxylic Acids

Carboxylate salts are often used as preservatives and flavor enhancers in soups and seasonings.
