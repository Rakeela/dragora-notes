Chapter 16: Carboxylic Acids and Esters

A carboxylic acid contains a carboxyl group, which consists of a hydroxyl group -OH attached to the carbon in a carbonyl group C=O.  (Commentary:  It's a carbonyl group bonded to an alcohol group.)

In the IUPAC names of carboxylic acids, the e in the alkane name is replaced with oic acid.  (The example is given of methane being carboxylized methanoic acid, the smallest carboxylic acid.  The example is given of ethane being carboxylized to ethanoic acid.)

Substituents are numbered from the carboxyl, which is carbon 1.  (The example is given of 2 methylpropanoic acid, which has a methyl -CH3 group on carbon 2.  The esxample is given of 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, which has a hydroxyl -OH group on carbon 3.)

As before, for benzoic acid, the placement of the substituents is shown using the prefixes ortho, meta, and para.  (The example is given of 4-aminobenzoic acid, which is para-aminobenzoic acid, or PABA.  It has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and an amino group at position 4.  The example is also given of 3,4-dichlorobenzoic acid, which has substituents at 1, 3, and 4, and therefore does not have a o/m/p common name.)

Many carboxylic acids are still named by their common names, which use prefixes form-, acet-, propion-, butyr-.  When using the common names, the greek letters alpha, beta, and gamma are assigned to the carbons adjacent to the carboxyl carbon.  (The example is given of 3-methylbutanoic acid, which is beta-methylbutyric acid.)  (Commentary:  The -oic ending becomes an -ic ending, too.)

A red ant sting contains methanoic acid (aka formic acid) that irritates the skin.  The sour taste of vinegar is due to ethanoic acid (acetic acid).  (Commentary:  With two carbons, the common prefix is acet-.)

Carboxylic acids can be prepared from primary alcohols or aldehydes.  From the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes and then to carboxylic acids.  (The example is given of ethanol (aka ethyl alcohol) oxidizing to ethanal (aka acetaldehyde) and then oxidizing again to ethanoic acid (aka acetic acid).). Ethanol in wine is oxidized by oxygen in the air, converting the primary alcohol to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid, the carboxylic acid in vinegar.

Alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) are found in fruits, milk, and sugar cane.  The examples are given of glycolic acid (from sugar cane), lactic acid (from sour milk), tartaric acid (from grapes), malic acid (from apples), and citric acid (from citrus fruits).  They are naturally occurring carboxylic acids with a hydroxyl group on the carbon atom that is adjacent to the carboxyl group.

Dermatologists have been using products with high concentrations (20-70%) of AHAs to remove acne scars and in skin peels to reduce irregular pigmentation and age spots.  Several different hydroxy acids may be found in skin care products singly or in combination.

16.2 Properties of Carboxylic Acids

Carboxylate salts are often used as preservatives and flavor enhancers in soups and seasonings.

Carboxylic acids are strongly polar because they have two polar groups.  (Commentary:  Both the carbonyl group and the hydroxyl group are polar thanks to the oxygen.)

The polar carboxyl groups allow carboxylic acids to form multiple hydrogen bonds with other carboxylic acid molecules.  This effect of hydrogen bonds give carboxylic acids higher boiling points than alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes of similar molar mass.  (The example is given of propanal (molar mass 58) which boils at 49C, 1-propanol (molar mass 60) which boils at 97C, and ethanoic acid (molar mass 60) which boils at 118C.)

The higher boiling points of carboxylic acids can also be attributed to the formation of dimers between two carboxylic acids.  (The carbonyl groups bond to the hydroxyl groups via hydrogen bonding, forming symmetrical connections between two carboxylic acid molecules.). Two hydrogen bonds form between their carboxyl groups, which effectively double the mass of the molecule, increasing the temperature required to reach the boiling points.

Carboxylic acids form hydrogen bonds with many water molecules.  With 1 to 5 carbon atoms, they are very soluble in water.  Their solubility decreases as the number of carbons increases.

Carboxylic acids are weak acids.  They exist mostly as molecules and a few ions in aqueous solution.  They dissociate in water to produce carboxylate ions and hydronium ions.  It can lose a proton because two oxygen atoms in a carboxylate ion stabilize negative charge.  (The reaction is given that ethanoic acid + H2O <-> ethanoate ion + Hydronium ion.)  (Teacher's commentary: The negative charge distributes between the two oxygens, forming a 1-and-a-half bond with both of the oxgygens the carbon is attached to.)

Name - Boiling Point - Solubility - Acid Dissociation Constant
Methanoic Acid - 101C - Soluble - 1.8x10^-4
Ethanoic Acid - 118C - Soluble - 1.8x10^-5
Propanoic Acid - 141C - Soluble - 1.3x10^-5
Butanoic Acid - 164C - Soluble - 1.5x10^-5
Pentanoic Acid - 187C - Soluble - 1.5x10^-5
Hexanoic Acid - 205C - Slightly Soluble - 1.4x10^-5
Benzoic Acid - 250C - Slightly Soluble - 6.4x10^-5

Carboxylate salts are a product of the neutralization of a carboxylic acid with a strong base such as NaOH or KOH.  The carboxylate ion is named by replacing the ic acid ending of the acid name with ate.  (The reactions are given of methanic acid + NaOH -> sodium methanoate and benzoic acid + KOH -> potassium benzoate.)

Carboxylate salts are ionic compounds with strong attractions between positively charged metal ions such as Li+, Na+, and K+ with the negatively charged carboxylate ion.  They are solids at room temperature, have high melting points, and are typically soluble in water.

Sodium propionate, a preservative, is added to bread, cheeses, and bakery items to inhibit the spoilage of the food by microorganisms.  Sodium benzoate is added to juices, margarine, relishes, salads, and jams to inhibit the growth of mold and bacteria.  (The formulae for sodium propionate and sodium benzoate are given.)

Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is added to meats, fish, vegetables, and bakery items to enhance flavor, although it may cause headaches in some people.  (The formula for monosodium glutamate is given.)
