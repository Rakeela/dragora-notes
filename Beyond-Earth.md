#Beyond-Earth

It's not [[Sid-Meiers-Alpha-Centauri]], and that game is better.  This was the spectre under which Beyond Earth labored.  I think it is its own game... yet I think it includes a spectacular misstep to my own tastes.  Something I'm thinking modding out.  The game's "Wonders" include "Deep Memory", an ancestor simulation... and a good candidate for the perpetration of [[# the-most-unethical-possible-act]].  The people in the "Deep Memory" simulation have no will and no protections.  Described as a "Human Conservation" project, it provides no protections whatsoever against the horrors of history in which it simulates people... forever.  The technology that enables it increase 'Purity'... I think I disagree.  It's a violation of civil rights, like the way the CEL cradles are used for mind-rape by the in-game intelligence agencies.

These and other details are among the hints of unacknowledged dystopianism in the lore of Beyond Earth.  Such existed also in the lore of Alpha Centauri.  I think that's somewhat innately respectable for the genre that these games run in.  To project humanity's struggles for domination into a scientifically advanced future is innately to invite in the horrors that accompany people struggling for domination over one another.  Yet I'm considering making a bit of a statement by modding out the parts I consider most abhorrent...  I would enjoy the game again if I did.  I could share the mod on the workshop.

People say that games 'make' the player do awful things... but some games even enable mods, so that what the player is 'made' to do can change based on their reflection upon the content.

Mod planning:
Objective One:
Replace "Deep Memory"
Objective Two:
Replace the CEL Cradle building quest with one that better respects civil rights
Objective Three:
Capstone virtues that refund cultural investments as virtue-dependent productivity.

Objective One Notes:
The Human Conservation tech speaks up the idea that "posthumans" are "no longer human" and that society could gain value or believe itself to gain value from retaining "what it means to be human".  I think that's... fair.  So then the replacement for Deep Memory should also fit these values, and I think I can fit them better... somehow.  I haven't yet decided what I'll do.

(Quote from source:)
"Followers of the "human conservation" philosophy seek to insure(sic) this through maintaining "pure" human culture, physiology and history through repositories and organizations scattered about this planet."

Insure should be ensure.  Game devs, I am disappointed; I ran right to a typo here when I wasn't looking to do typo reviews at all.  I'm immediately disappointed by something else as well: this refers to repositories and organizations scattered about the planet, but it provides only one building: the Deep Memory wonder itself.  Perhaps I could convert the Deep Memory wonder into a building that could be built in many locations, using its icon and reducing its effect.

After review of the Deep Memory wonder, my objection to it arises in its described use of ancestral brain maps to create its simulations.  This suggests to me the instrumentalization of consciousness, which is *not* ethical, and in fact is indeed the most profound violation of rights per the most unethical act.  This also suggests to me the correct replacement for the structure:  The Seeds of Yggdrasil.

The purpose of creating cultural simulations of unprecedented detail and immersion can be done without violating simulated consciousnesses if it is done with one major modification: the simulations must be created by artists and experts who have been uploaded of their own volition instead of by automated systems manipulating human brain maps for the entertainment of others.

There is one major issue with this replacement: it makes the "Human Conservation" aspect disappointing.  There's no question to me that this jack-in-and-run-minds system is the capacity of the seed of Yggdrasil and there's no question to me that a Yggdrasil system could be used to do this, but given its omnirepresentative potential, I don't imagine Yggdrasil being founded in "Purity".

Maybe the building quest should reference that.  Perhaps an option that gives +Culture to Nodes?  What should it be opposed by?  The other option should be just as empowering.  The Dome is the Purity improvement; the Biowell is the Harmony improvement.

Since this is considered a Purity building, it would be thematic to have it provide +1 culture from Domes as its base effect, but then players who aren't building Domes would pass it up, as would players building Terrascapes heavily to create a 'New Earth'.  Oh, and then there are all the basic balance issues with Beyond Earth in general... tch...  Perfecting old cultural properties is more trouble than it's worth!  Maybe the base effect should be to refund Cultural production to the tune of 10% of Culture converted into Food and Health, representing that people could 'live' in perfect Seed of Yggdrasil simulations while still contributing to society, with an efficacy dependent on cultural production.

Objective Two Notes:
I don't want to get into this right this moment, but I want to record a snippet of an idea:
"The CEL Cradles offer such unprecedented access to the minds of their users that our researchers believe only preventative development of an application for that access has a chance to avert malevolent exploitation."
