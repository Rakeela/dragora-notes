#Beyond-Earth

It's not [[Sid-Meiers-Alpha-Centauri]], and that game is better.  This was the spectre under which Beyond Earth labored.  I think it is its own game... yet I think it includes a spectacular misstep to my own tastes.  Something I'm thinking modding out.  The game's "Wonders" include "Deep Memory", an ancestor simulation... and a good candidate for the perpetration of [[# the-most-unethical-possible-act]].  The people in the "Deep Memory" simulation have no will and no protections.  Described as a "Human Conservation" project, it provides no protections whatsoever against the horrors of history in which it simulates people... forever.  The technology that enables it increase 'Purity'... I think I disagree.  It's a violation of civil rights, like the way the CEL cradles are used for mind-rape by the in-game intelligence agencies.

These and other details are among the hints of unacknowledged dystopianism in the lore of Beyond Earth.  Such existed also in the lore of Alpha Centauri.  I think that's somewhat innately respectable for the genre that these games run in.  To project humanity's struggles for domination into a scientifically advanced future is innately to invite in the horrors that accompany people struggling for domination over one another.  Yet I'm considering making a bit of a statement by modding out the parts I consider most abhorrent...  I would enjoy the game again if I did.  I could share the mod on the workshop.

People say that games 'make' the player do awful things... but some games even enable mods, so that what the player is 'made' to do can change based on their reflection upon the content.

Mod planning:
Objective One:
Replace "Deep Memory"
Objective Two:
Replace the CEL Cradle building quest with one that better respects civil rights

Objective One Notes:
The Human Conservation tech speaks up the idea that "posthumans" are "no longer human" and that society could gain value or believe itself to gain value from retaining "what it means to be human".  I think that's... fair.  So then the replacement for Deep Memory should also fit these values, and I think I can fit them better... somehow.  I haven't yet decided what I'll do.

(Quote from source:)
"Followers of the "human conservation" philosophy seek to insure(sic) this through maintaining "pure" human culture, physiology and history through repositories and organizations scattered about this planet."

Insure should be ensure.  Game devs, I am disappointed; I ran right to a typo here when I wasn't looking to do typo reviews at all.  I'm immediately disappointed by something else as well: this refers to repositories and organizations scattered about the planet, but it provides only one building: the Deep Memory wonder itself.

Perhaps I could convert the Deep Memory wonder into a building that could be built elsewhere, using its icon and reducing its effect.

Objective Two Notes:
I don't want to get into this right this moment, but I want to record a snippet of an idea:
"The CEL Cradles offer such unprecedented access to the minds of their users that our researchers believe only preventative development of an application for that access has a chance to avert malevolent exploitation."
