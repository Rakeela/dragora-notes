#Beyond-Earth

It's not [[Sid-Meiers-Alpha-Centauri]], and that game is better.  This was the spectre under which Beyond Earth labored.  I think it is its own game... yet I think it includes a spectacular misstep to my own tastes.  Something I'm thinking modding out.  The game's "Wonders" include "Deep Memory", an ancestor simulation... and a good candidate for the perpetration of [[# the-most-unethical-possible-act]].  The people in the "Deep Memory" simulation have no will and no protections.  Described as a "Human Conservation" project, it provides no protections whatsoever against the horrors of history in which it simulates people... forever.

There are hints of unacknowledged dystopianism in the lore of Beyond Earth, as there were in the lore of Alpha Centauri.  I think that's somewhat innately respectable for the genre that it runs in.  Yet I'm considering making a bit of a statement by modding out the parts I consider abhorrent.  I would enjoy the game again if I did.
