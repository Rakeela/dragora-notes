# Notes on Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells

This is a companion file to the essays that I'm currently attempting to write about tolerogenicity, [[a-general-protocol-for-tolerogenic-rna-vaccination]] and [[tolerogenic-rna-vaccination-vs-dendrispecific-rna-vaccination]].  The most promising thing that I've noticed is that I may be able to prove dendrispecificity of RNA vaccines.  I haven't necessarily gotten to it first, but I also haven't found it in the literature yet.  It's an inference I plucked from some raw data.  That's exciting.  And yet...

And yet tolerogenic dendritic cells are an anti-senescence advance, the kind of thing which might by mastery give to all of medicine a little more breathing room by making people healthier in a stable, productive, no-downsides kind of way.  Studying tolerogenic dendritic cells is very exciting and pushing that tech forward is great.  Sure, I'll *also* try to demonstrate that a new technique gains useful features by highly dendrispecific interactions with the immune system, but I don't see a link between dendrispecific RNA vaccinations and full-fledged longevity advances the way I see such a link for tolerogenic RNA vaccinations.

This is a general review document covering potential tolerogenicity scenarios for dendritic cells.  It's a great study resource that talks about the mechanisms of the cells as well as the open questions in the field - at least as of four years ago.  Four years is not huge in medical research chronology; I'm excited by the recency of this material!

It looks like there may have been a trial of an HIV treatment using autologous dendritic cells?  In that case, establishing therapeutic safety for dendritic cell interventions may be more straightforward than expected, reducing the extent of the research timelines involved in bringing a new immunoresponse tuning technology to market.

This is a phase 1 clinical trial for tolerogenic dendritic cells.  Apparently it's already being studied in humans.  If there are any complete researches...

Agh.  I'm so, so tired.  I'm teary-eyed and in pain, hah.  I want this research to work because I want this to be the answer to *my* problems.  I want to stop having forever-aches and I want to stop taking anti-inflammatories daily.  That's why I care more about tolerogenic dendritic cells generally than I do about proving something novel about dendrispecificity in RNA vaccines.  If I were *already* entirely healthy rather than dreaming of someday *being* entirely healthy, I would turn my focus onto the thing that gave me dead searches when I tried to query archives to figure out if anyone else had noticed what I had noticed.  I can't tell if I'm doing the right thing by letting myself get distracted by the selfish health interest instead of the greater potential scientific novelty.  I can tell that I'm really struggling with productivity today.  It's 4PM and my day barely felt like it had time to happen in.

What can I even do that would be novel in this space?  The procedures are laid out well enough that I feel like I could conceivably bootleg a trial.  I wouldn't, of course; it'd be a lot of work for no gain.  

Are the procedures optimal?  This goes to my work on [[a-general-protocol-for-tolerogenic-rna-vaccination]], which is my best current hope for finding a novel contribution to the research on tolerogenic RNA vaccination.  I think that a single efficient and generalizable process can be defined which can be tested for safety only once, sidestepping some of the repetitive/duplicative research.  Not that replications are worthless, but I have an impossible selfish interest in seeing a result sooner than later.

Yet I'm having trouble studying.  I'm in pain, and psychologically, everything that alleviates pain undoes a lot of its own gain by being distracting.  I actually *didn't* use cannabis today, and I believe that skipping it made me *less* productive in studying.

If tolerogenic dendrites permit excess/unwanted autoimmune responses to be shut off, will this enable a greater use of induced autoimmunity in medicine?  I wouldn't want to give people more net inflammation, but shifting the immune system's autoimmune targeting towards something useful (such as clearing out cells with the senescent phenotype) could be useful.  Is there anything about the surface proteins of [[senescent cells]] which could be loaded into an RNA vaccine to serve as a new immunotarget?

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31440223/  (Kim, WS.  Yoon, J-H.  Shin, M-K.  Shin, SJ.  (2019, Aug 7)  Infection of Dendritic Cells with Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis Exhibits a Functionally Tolerogenic Phenotype in Response to Toll-Like Receptor Agonists via IL-10/Cox2/PGE2/EP2 Axis.  *Frontiers in Microbiology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-12.)

If I really want my *General Protocol* to be a breakthrough, perhaps I can determine how *this* works.  Condensing tolerogenesis to a single injection might be possible using information derived from the study of Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominisuis (MAH).

I feel a little overwhelmed by this material, but if I'm understanding it correctly, the MAH-infected dendritic cells expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at a higher level, which resulted in them interfering with immunoresponse rather than encouraging it.  This however talks about treating the dendritic cells with LPS, which if it refers to lipopolysaccharides (aka endotoxins, found in the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria) refers to something that is...  oh, that's the major outer membrane protein of MAH, which is a gram-negative bacteria.  This suggests that if the dendritic cells are attacking an MAH infection, the ones that have already been infected will turn tolerogenic as they're processing the MAH membrane proteins.

This asserts strongly that the (a?) tolerogenic phenotype of dendritic cells was (in this case?) induced by Interleukin 10 (IL-10).  It further traces the causality to cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2), by asserting that a Cox2 inhibitor (celecoxib) prevented production of IL-10.  This establishes Cox2-mediation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as the cause of the infected cells producing more IL-10 and becoming tolerogenic dendritic cells.  Applying a blocker against EP2 receptors also prevented IL-10 production, suggesting that PGE2 binding at EP2 was signalling for IL-10 production.  Does that generalize sufficiently that a dendrispecific EP2 agonist could be used to induce tolerogenic dendrite development?
