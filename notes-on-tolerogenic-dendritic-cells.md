# Notes on Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells

This is a companion file to the essays that I'm currently attempting to write about tolerogenicity, [[a-general-protocol-for-tolerogenic-rna-vaccination]] and [[tolerogenic-rna-vaccination-vs-dendrispecific-rna-vaccination]].  The most promising thing that I've noticed is that I may be able to prove dendrispecificity of RNA vaccines.  I haven't necessarily gotten to it first, but I also haven't found it in the literature yet.  It's an inference I plucked from some raw data.  That's exciting.  And yet...

And yet tolerogenic dendritic cells are an anti-senescence advance, the kind of thing which might by mastery give to all of medicine a little more breathing room by making people healthier in a stable, productive, no-downsides kind of way.  Studying tolerogenic dendritic cells is very exciting and pushing that tech forward is great.  Sure, I'll *also* try to demonstrate that a new technique gains useful features by highly dendrispecific interactions with the immune system, but I don't see a link between dendrispecific RNA vaccinations and full-fledged longevity advances the way I see such a link for tolerogenic RNA vaccinations.

This is a general review document covering potential tolerogenicity scenarios for dendritic cells.  It's a great study resource that talks about the mechanisms of the cells as well as the open questions in the field - at least as of four years ago.  Four years is not huge in medical research chronology; I'm excited by the recency of this material!

It looks like there may have been a trial of an HIV treatment using autologous dendritic cells?  In that case, establishing therapeutic safety for dendritic cell interventions may be more straightforward than expected, reducing the extent of the research timelines involved in bringing a new immunoresponse tuning technology to market.

Retrieved 2021-2-10.)

This is a phase 1 clinical trial for tolerogenic dendritic cells.  Apparently it's already being studied in humans.  If there are any complete researches...

Agh.  I'm so, so tired.  I'm teary-eyed and in pain, hah.  I want this research to work because I want this to be the answer to *my* problems.  I want to stop having forever-aches and I want to stop taking anti-inflammatories daily.  That's why I care more about tolerogenic dendritic cells generally than I do about proving something novel about dendrispecificity in RNA vaccines.  If I were *already* entirely healthy rather than dreaming of someday *being* entirely healthy, I would turn my focus onto the thing that gave me dead searches when I tried to query archives to figure out if anyone else had noticed what I had noticed.  I can't tell if I'm doing the right thing by letting myself get distracted by the selfish health interest instead of the greater potential scientific novelty.  I can tell that I'm really struggling with productivity today.  It's 4PM and my day barely felt like it had time to happen in.

What can I even do that would be novel in this space?  The procedures are laid out well enough that I feel like I could conceivably bootleg a trial.  I wouldn't, of course; it'd be a lot of work for no gain.  

Are the procedures optimal?  This goes to my work on [[a-general-protocol-for-tolerogenic-rna-vaccination]], which is my best current hope for finding a novel contribution to the research on tolerogenic RNA vaccination.  I think that a single efficient and generalizable process can be defined which can be tested for safety only once, sidestepping some of the repetitive/duplicative research.  Not that replications are worthless, but I have an impossible selfish interest in seeing a result sooner than later.

Yet I'm having trouble studying.  I'm in pain, and psychologically, everything that alleviates pain undoes a lot of its own gain by being distracting.  I actually *didn't* use cannabis today, and I believe that skipping it made me *less* productive in studying.

If tolerogenic dendrites permit excess/unwanted autoimmune responses to be shut off, will this enable a greater use of induced autoimmunity in medicine?  I wouldn't want to give people more net inflammation, but shifting the immune system's autoimmune targeting towards something useful (such as clearing out cells with the senescent phenotype) could be useful.  Is there anything about the surface proteins of [[senescent cells]] which could be loaded into an RNA vaccine to serve as a new immunotarget?

(2019, Aug 7)  Infection of Dendritic Cells with Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis Exhibits a Functionally Tolerogenic Phenotype in Response to Toll-Like Receptor Agonists via IL-10/Cox2/PGE2/EP2 Axis.  *Frontiers in Microbiology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-12.)

If I really want my *General Protocol* to be a breakthrough, perhaps I can determine how *this* works.  Condensing tolerogenesis to a single injection might be possible using information derived from the study of Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominisuis (MAH).

I feel a little overwhelmed by this material, but if I'm understanding it correctly, the MAH-infected dendritic cells expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at a higher level, which resulted in them interfering with immunoresponse rather than encouraging it.  This however talks about treating the dendritic cells with LPS, which if it refers to lipopolysaccharides (aka endotoxins, found in the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria) refers to something that is...  oh, that's the major outer membrane protein of MAH, which is a gram-negative bacteria.  This suggests that if the dendritic cells are attacking an MAH infection, the ones that have already been infected will turn tolerogenic as they're processing the MAH membrane proteins.

This asserts strongly that the (a?) tolerogenic phenotype of dendritic cells was (in this case?) induced by Interleukin 10 (IL-10).  It further traces the causality to cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2), by asserting that a Cox2 inhibitor (celecoxib) prevented production of IL-10.  This establishes Cox2-mediation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as the cause of the infected cells producing more IL-10 and becoming tolerogenic dendritic cells.  Applying a blocker against EP2 receptors also prevented IL-10 production, suggesting that PGE2 binding at EP2 was signalling for IL-10 production.  Does that generalize sufficiently that a dendrispecific EP2 agonist could be used to induce tolerogenic dendrite development?

I was looking for information about EP2 agonists, and I found this.  It's not especially relevant, but I've included it for interest's sake.  It talks about why sexually transmitted diseases transfer so well - by piggyback on semen-induced tolerogenesis.

The actual paper does speak somewhat about the chemodynamics of EP2 receptors, so I could conceivably return to it, though at a glance it doesn't look like it contains the information I was looking for at this time.

Up-regulation of EP2 and EP3 receptors in human tolerogenic dendritic cells boosts the immunosuppressive activity of PGE2.  *Journal of Leukocyte Biology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-12.)

This talks about tolerogenic dendritic cells having up-regulated expression of EP2 and EP3 receptors, which induce IL-10 production when agonized.  It concludes by suggesting that EP receptor agonists/antagonists might be relevant to designing novel drug templates to modulate immune response.

I think it also suggests something for tolerogenesis, and I wonder if...  I wonder if I'm being very foolish thinking about generating tolerogenic dendritic cells by any in situ process.  It would risk general immunosuppression while the tol-dcs lived, without good targeting.  I think I've chased the wrong angle here and found nothing to reduce the need for autologous dendritic cell therapy to achieve controlled tolerogenesis.  At best, studying these mechanisms may indicate a different potential mechanism for inducing the tolerogenic phenotype.

If I had a research budget for trying to produce my *General Protocol*, I would want to take a stop-watch and start figuring out how long it takes different tolerogenic-induction processes to complete, including all process labor steps.  Not to mention that it would produce a burst of general excitement for replicating the work of other scientists - it'd be part of a substantive project itself.  The micro-optimizing business methods style is underappreciated for its power to make an achievement out of what is otherwise likely to be an unrewarding investment in redoing existing research.

Tolerogenesis induction was not, however, the most important part of this..  I also don't understand how to go from potentially antigenic surfaces to RNA coding that causes dendritic cells to manifest those surfaces.  I want to define an I/O operation, where the input is a self-immune response to a defined antigenic surface, and the output is a step-by-step process for producing a tolerogenic dendritic cell population specialized in quelling immunoresponse to that antigenic surface.

Hypothetically, a strain of *hypoallergenic* dendritic cells might get away from the additional time and labor involved in working with autologous dendritic cells, but I have no idea about the feasibility of that.

How  do researchers discover what proteins a particular RNA sequence codes for?  I don't even know if this is a basic question or an advanced question.  Looking up the process of gene expression itself, RNA strands are shorn from the helix by a duplicative chemical process (the DNA helix is not itself destroyed) and the shorn duplicate is read by a ribosome that outputs a polypeptide according to the RNA strand.

When we put an antigen surface protein to a dendritic cell in the form of RNA, we're giving the cell the RNA that codes for a particular polypeptide sequence.  Is it just one sequence, which the cell then sticks to its outer membrane?  Is it multiple sequences to assemble a protein?  How many strips of RNA go into an RNA vaccine?  To what extent are the target antigenic surfaces just polypeptide sequence vs to what extent are they complex folded proteins?

This is COVID-19 research.  I'm looking at it, because I'm wondering how a particular strand of RNA was identified as coding for the coronavirus spike protein.  It doesn't look like it has the right information...  I need to keep searching.

I wonder if defining this research process the way I want to would put together the substance of a textbook.

(Quoted from source abstract.)
"A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016."

This looks more like what I was looking for.  This is talking about the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of a different (although closely related) virus.  This talks a little about its creation, specifying that the protein was grown in yeast.  I'm guessing that this is the generality: transgenic yeast are used to express bits of DNA to see what they produce with it.  This gives citations 4-6 for this, suggesting that I can find more about the specific manufacturing processes if I can dig into the bibliography of this research.

Something about discovering that this involves yeast makes me feel like my thoughts about using yeast to breed enhanced xenomitochondria strains might have been really on-point.  That's off-topic, but go me, I still want to do some work with bioreactors down the line.

I kind of like how all my thoughts on this are in a 'technically indeterminate' mode.  I haven't published anything yet.  I could be really wrong without having strongly declared any position.

Digging for more of the manufacturing research, I've found this.  It confirms transgenic yeast used to replicate proteins.  I'm still trying to determine if it somehow reveals information about the methods of recombinant protein construction.  I don't feel like I'm learning about that here, but I do feel like I just learned something that I'm actually searching for.  I may want to add another 'notes-on' file to represent my study of recombinant protein construction more directly, returning this file to a purer focus on tolerogenic dendritic cells.

I'm concerned that there may be a critical reason to need this research done sooner rather than later, and implemented faster rather than slower.  I believe on the basis of my current understanding that brain implants are likely to be pro-inflammatory on the neural environment, and that brain inflammation is intimately linked to the progression of mental disorders.  As a transhumanist, I want to see the mind-machine interface thing done *very well*, yet I'm now concerned that if brain implantation technology accelerates ahead of immunoresponse tuning technology the risk of injuries and illnesses resulting from brain implantation procedures will be considerably increased.  We may be inviting an era of mad cyborg diseases if we don't learn how to tell the immune system to stop attacking things before we add new things to the self-environment of the body.

Brain implantation research really wants to operate more on the consumer technology research cycle (fast and loose with occasional fatalities because cool ideas are implemented before they're safe) rather than on the medical technology research cycle (so painstakingly slow that people die preventably because doctors are afraid to kill anyone by rushing technology).  That disconnect might be a problem if tolerogenesis research can't be accelerated.

I say this knowing that accelerating tolerogenesis research reduces the likelihood that I'll have anything novel to contribute.  I'm studying it *as a student* right now.  This project exists as a study aid.

BTW, the fact that projects can function as study aids is something that I think should be used as a justification for people to be allowed to take on projects 'beyond their status'.  I've run into the taboo of being treated as arrogant because I dared think about things that people of my role in life were not allowed to think about; growing up, I would never have expected that to be possible in a nation as advanced as *America*, as that particular moralism was presented in the literature of my youth as a trait of primitive foreign nations!  Yet I'm now aware by experience that people really do bend their lives around it sometimes, so I'd like to say, consider that science depends on research replication.  The same work has to be done repeatedly over time to make it stable and well-trusted.  This is obviously true when people maintain physical machinery, but sometimes less obvious when people are maintaining structures of concept and cognition.  If people take on a research project that can't possibly prove anything new, but they're doing it with their own resources, any such work should be honored.  Sometimes research projects that can't prove anything new should be pursued by organizations with substantive resources as well, though it is beyond me to judge the optimal rate for that.

This is a protocol document for how to extract dendritic cells from a sample.  This is the kind of thing I want to improve or extend.  This affirms my usage of the word 'protocol' for describing such documents and suggests that using the word protocol in future searches may be productive, as may a more intent review of *Current Protocols in Immunology*.

The use of sheep's blood admixtures is intriguing.  What an unexpectedly alchemical inclusion in a modern scientific process!

I'm having some trouble finding "UNIT 7.1" in the material, which would explain the most basic step in the protocol, but I've noticed something rendering this non-optimal.  For optimal deployment of tolerogenic dendrite, the purification of the sample should ideally in some manner continue until it has secured a population wholly of immature dendritic cells.  If I have to produce that myself, the likelihood that my protocol requires laboratory work to verify increases very dramatically.

...how immunoreactive would someone else's transplanted dendritic cells be?  Don't try that on a human.  If some kind of 'universal donor' dendritic cells could be found or defined, then curing immune disorders could be reduced to an injection from a common standard transplant population maintained in bioreactors at every hospital.  Can the need of autologous dendritic cells be eliminated?

Included for interest.  I haven't reviewed this yet.  This is something I found while looking for dendritic cell transplantation experiments, but this also focuses on autologous dendritic cells.  I'm having trouble finding research that doesn't.  I assume there's some good reason for that.  If I don't eventually turn up a 'why not' in the archive, I must say that while I do agree that trying immune cell transplants on humans first would be homicidally premature, some animal trials should be scheduled.

The abstract here talks about allotransplant dendritic cells, which is what I was looking for.  I'll have to dig into it and see what the researchers did.

..it looks like the reason why allotransplanted dendritic cells occurred here appears to be due to the kidney transplant.  This is about kidney transplant rejection.  Host leukocyte inflammation extinguished donor leukocyte populations in rejected transplants.  I'm more curious what happens to donor leukocyte populations when transplants aren't rejected, but this may still not be the source I need for that.  It does talk about dendritic cell behavior "under homeostasis", which it contrasts with dendritic cell behavior "during allograft rejection", suggesting that the answer I'm looking for *may* be that donor dendritic cells function normally when the allotransplantation does not cause rejection.  I'm not confident in my reading of this text.

Something about this thought seriously stresses me out, but I wonder if semen could be refined for tolerogenic compounds usable in deliberately maturing tolerogenic dendrites for use in producing vaccinations against autoimmune diseases.  I *think* I know why the thought stresses me out.  It's because it makes the experiment very gross.

This material does however suggest that controllable tolerogenic impetuses already exist 'in the wild' and are already incorporated into the evolutionary schema of existing pathogens.  Deliberate maturation of dendritic cells in a chemically tolerogenic environment should be possible without requiring the dendritic cells to undergo DNA or RNA modification.  This may be able to accelerate the production of tolerogenic dendritic cells.

If these cultivated tolerogenic dendritic cells could also be produced in some hypo-antigenic form not inspiring immune rejection, central cultivation could be used to greatly accelerate the production of autoimmune vaccines by eliminating the individualization step of using autologous dendritic cells.  What I want to know is what happens to the immune system when allotransplanted organs *don't* inspire organ rejection?  Organ rejection isn't observed in all cases that could theoretically express it.  What's happening in that edge of probabilities where the immune system might freak out, but doesn't?  Can we produce our own population of dendritic cells that might make their recipients' immune system freak out, but don't?

---
I'm kind of worried based on the research I'm reading that finding out what happens in an ideal scenario of transplantation may be impossible.  What kind of researcher closely inspects the scenarios "where nothing goes wrong"?  Yet here I am with questions answerable with the optimal scenario's data, finding too much disaster in the archives to answer them.  The donor's dendritic cells aren't identical to the recipient's dendritic cells even in the optimal scenario.  They must interact with *something*, *somewhere*.  If non-rejection scenarios involve the presence or absence of definable traits, non-immunogenic populations of cultured dendritic cells may be possible.

This mentions Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA), which suggests a study target for conjectured 'universal donor' dendritic cells.  I don't have access to the full text, but the abstract alone gives me a stepping stone in my research.  Incidentally, could organ transplant rejection rates be reduced by bathing to-be-transplanted organs in a siRNA solution that knocks down alloantigenic surfaces?

Looking up Human Leukocyte Antigens on wikipedia, there's a section on transplant rejections as well.  This reveals...  ah.  It reveals that the HLA sites are a highly specific self-recognition system.

Reading about the MHC proteins and their occasionally chaotic binding patterns, this looks like a candidate for the system that entropy erodes to create gradual mislearning in autoinflammatory (autoimmune) syndromes.  At one point in this source, it suggests that type 1 diabetes may be caused by a thermodynamically unfavorable (yet not impossible) binding of InsB9–23 (an insulin B chain-derived peptide) with the peptide binding groove on MHC class II proteins.  As time goes on and the body performs many, many chemical operations, the likelihood of improbable-but-possible binding arrangements mounts.

My first thought:  That sounds like a job for a dose of silencer RNA to the tumor cells.  That's what I thought reading *the title*, prior to reading the source.  If the tumor cells are doing something immunosuppressive that other cells aren't doing, won't siRNA restoring normal function to the affected cells be intrinsically tumor-specific through not changing the instructions being executed by other cells.

I'm including this because I had that thought, and also for general ongoing review of potential tolerogenic compounds.

Could transgenic dendritic cells be created which don't express the peptide binding groove at all?  They would fail as dendritic cells in many ways, but they could still present antigens if they phagocytose RNA vaccine lipid capsules.  Without the peptide binding groove, they might no longer provoke immune responses by their own presence.  Creating a replicating synthetic immune cell based on dendritic cells and specialized for receipt of RNA vaccines and tolerogenic RNA vaccines could be desirable as an artificial modification to the human immune system, as it would slightly improve vaccination response while dramatically increasing the efficiency of deploying treatments for immunosenescence and autoimmune diseases.

Which genes prompt dendritic cells to express the peptide binding groove?  Can modified dendritic cell precursors be created which differentiate into hypoallergenic psuedodendritic cells?  I suspect such PD-C cells are possible.  Nor is it necessarily important to inject people with the modified precursor cells; separate culturing of psuedodendritic cells from modified precursors could generate that central supply population which would make implementing this tech much easier.  It's not exactly a problem if the psuedodendritic cells do not sustain a stably replicating population (as I expect they would not in an individual who lacked the relevant modified precursors), as long as they can survive long enough to serve the purpose for which they were prepared as an injection.

---
A purified sample of immature dendritic cells may be possible through using a recombinant IgG protein to opsonize the mature dendritic cells in a mixed culture of dendritic cells and macrophages.  The mature dendritic cells will then be phagocytosed, and the macrophages can be then be purified out of the sample.  However, if this cellular processing task produces antigen proteins, I would be concerned of the possibility of creating self-antigens in the culture.  I'll keep thinking about this.

This offers some information on the structure of the peptide binding groove

(Quoted from source)
"The classic HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C class I molecules consist of an α and a β chains. The α chain masses 45 kilodalton (kDa) and is 362-366 amino acids long. It is encoded by the respective class I genes within the MHC. The β chain, β2 microglobulin (12 kDa), is encoded by its respective gene on chromosome 15. The α chain has three ≈90 amino acid extracellular domains encoded by exons 2, 3, and 4, respectively, a transmembrane segment (≈ 25 amino acids) encoded by exon 5 and a C-terminal cytoplasmic end (≈30 amino acids) encoded by exons 6 and 7. β2 microglobulin, which is invariant, comprises the fourth domain (Fig. 5.2). The first two α domains (α1 and α2) are the most distal to the cell membrane. They combine to form a domain with a peptide-binding groove, or cleft, that is flanked by a surface that interacts with a TCR or a NK cell killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)."

The problem with dendritic cells not expressing the peptide binding grooove is that the groove itself is made of HLA molecules.  Maybe the groove could be prevented from forming by knocking out the HLA genes, but then you don't even have enough of an immune cell for my tolerogenesis ideas to be tested.  I need the cell to retain internal HLA processing without exposing the groove.  It's the groove itself that exposes an allotransplanted dendritic cell as 'not-self' to the recipient's immune system.  I want to create a tamed & anodyne antigen-presenter that can hold bits of arthritogenic (or otherwise inappropriately self-reactive) protein, migrate to the lymph nodes, and then say to the T-cells, "Look at this protein.  If this looks like a target, delete yourself as a malfunctioning self-eater."  I think that's how immune (de-)training works.  Without the HLA molecules, the dendritic cell won't be able to do key steps for internal antigen processing and presentation on the membrane, so nixing them won't work.

My current understanding is that age-related autoimmune diseases are the product of the gradual accretion of low-odds reactions within the immune system.  The immune system tries not to self-react, but when it interacts with self-proteins in unusual (thermodynamically improbable) ways, it fails to recognize them as self-proteins.  Antigen-presenting cells then start showing each other self-antigens derived from self-proteins that bound to them in improbable ways.  As the immune system arms against such "pathogens" it becomes more likely to self-react in the unwanted way, fueling the development of chronic inflammation and slowing the immune system's response to actual pathogens.

Current treatments seem to focus on trying to suppress inappropriate immunoresponse, but I'm dissatisfied with this; preventing an improper immune response is very good and appropriate, but it doesn't look like suppression alone would force the immune system to forget its improper (thermodynamically improbable) interpretations of self-proteins.  The immune system *can* in theory force its cells to forget bad associations (by apoptosing the mislearned immune cells), but it doesn't look like it is *skilled* at doing so.  It looks distinctly bad at it, actually.  I'm finding more evidence that pathogens exploit this strategy than that it actually works properly in the body.  (I've been disincluding links to bacteria and parasites which can suppress immunoresponse.)  Using autologous dendritic cells designed for induction of tolerogenesis, it should be possible to create specialized immune system correcting treatments which force the mistaught immune cells to apoptose... but that treatment takes hours of work per patient and days of culturing in the lab.  You need a day of labor from a researcher per patient.  If that's the treatment that is possible, it'll go to market like that someday and be a very good thing.  Yet ideally, we need people with exceptional lab skills doing more fundamental work than that, and the expense barrier will be prohibitive for an awfully long time if the procedure can't be improved from that level.  Bankers interested in betting on the success of already-sickly people are a rare and easily exhausted resources, so medical treatments have to be built on the resources the population-to-benefit can already get access to, rather than the superior resources that they would have access to if they were successfully treated.

A *general donor* dendritic cell population would permit this treatment to be implemented quickly using centrally cultured (pseudo-)dendritic cells.  Standard vaccinations are in the resource budget of almost every population on Earth (barriers to universal global vaccination are predominantly cultural rather than economic or technological), and a *general donor* dendritic cell population should be something that can be brought almost to the standard vaccination level of individual investment.  That would make the eradication of autoimmune diseases something blatantly cost-effective that will see global uptake.  Which, in turn, would improve human sanity via the relief of pointless pains.  Suffering without cause or merit only makes people *less* rational, and the lessons of autoimmunity are not lessons useful to sapience...

Would any other kind of antigen-presenter cell be capable of doing this?  I need to study that.  If dendritic cells cannot be mangled in the specific way that I imagine them being mangled, could we fabricate psuedodendritic cells as a kind of antigen-presenting nanomachinery?

At the suggestion of Tiltwolf on the Freedom of Form Foundation discord server, I should like to try creating HLA-1 knockout dendritic cells.  I'm not sure that the dendritic cells could process peptides for antigen presentation without HLA-1, but I'm reasonably sure they couldn't produce the peptide binding groove without them.  If they retain enough of their antigen presentation abilities, but shed the bit of their cellular anatomy that reveals their other-ness to the immune system, a general donor population of dendritic cells could be generated in that manner.

I need to synthesize the research on knocking out HLA-1 in stem cells with research I have on directing differentiation of stem cells into dendritic cells.  A transgenic anergizer-specialist dendritic cell with universal donor properties may be achievable... or it may not.  It may only turn out to yield a nonviable mutant cell population, but whether or not it would *work in the immune system*, I think that population can be made to exist in culture.  I just wouldn't want to inject the resulting cells into a human first... it would have to prove a good advancement in mouse medicine, first.

This is about the differentiation of stem cells into dendritic cells.  It describes a 1-month protocol for differentiating stem cells into dendritic cells with tolerogenic properties, by feeding the stem cell colony ever 2-3 days with a cytokine-doped nutrient mixture.

If this works on HLA-1 knockout stem cells...  it's what I need.  I need to replicate this using a supply of HLA-1 knockout stem cells and then observe the resulting dendritic cell population to see if they 1) are viable cells, and 2) do not express the immunogenic peptide binding groove.  If the dendritic cells quality for further work, I will then need to treat the resulting dendritic cell population with RNA lipid vesicles containing potentially antigenic surface proteins which I would like to achieve tolerogenesis for.  If the dendritic cells still phagocytose and process the RNA lipid vesicles for presentation...  well... that may be the product I was trying to invent right there.

This is the link that Tiltwolf gave me for a protocol on generating HLA-1 knockout stem cells using CRISPR-Cas9.  HLA-1 molecules express on all nucleated cells and are other-markers which can cause transplant rejection.  HLA-2 molecules are exclusively expressed on anti-gen presenting cells.  Furthermore, the peptide binding groove of the dendritic cells (per my current understanding) is made of HLA-1 molecules.

I feel like what I need to do here is reflective grunt work.  Just as it's been a useful exercise to transcribe parts of other works (such as when I transcribed [[further-reading-from-the-ethical-slut]]), I should transcribe pieces of protocol to create a step-by-step description of how to produce the mutant cell population of dendritic cells without HLA-1.  I'm struggling with a predominantly psychological barrier.  It doesn't feel like "real work" to copy bits of two other protocols into a new synthetic form with a different outcome, and I don't know how to make doing it feel like "real work" that needs to be done.  So I'm sitting on it and being frustrated at myself.

...my vocabulary is imperfect to this work.  I "can" read the material... but it might be important to admit that I can read it only with difficulty.  I think I would gain a lot of fluency if I could have a worksheet of the terms.  Give definitions with a blank, so I could fill in the label on them.  I like doing assignments of that kind, although I know also that I can gain fluency by pushing myself to continued study.

As advanced options for HLA matching in allogeneic settings, two strategies were explored. First, we generated HLA class I pseudo-homozygous iPSCs from HLA heterozygous donors by allele-specific genome editing to reduce the number of donors needed. Second, given the pivotal role of HLA-C for suppressing NK cells, we deleted HLA-A and HLA-B biallelically and retained a single haplotype of HLA-C to generate HLA-C-retained iPSCs (also preserving non-canonical HLA-E, -F, and -G), which greatly expand donor compatibility. In both cases, the cells were capable of suppressing T and NK cell activity while retaining HLA expression and antigen presentation to a certain extent. Moreover, this strategy can be combined with HLA class II depletion by a targeted KO of class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator (CIITA), if necessary.

"While retaining HLA expression" is potentially troubling.  "While retaining antigen presentation" is potentially key.  Part of what's exciting about the experimental variation I've proposed on this research, is that I can approach the unknown in experimentation.  I want to do something whose results I cannot clearly predict from available research, in the hopes of improving the predictive power of future research.

Following gRNA transfection, IFN-g treatment and HLA-A2 sorting of iPSCs, we analyzed genomic DNA by Sanger sequencing and found that 100% (16/16 clones) of sorted cells harbored indels, whereas only 47.6% (10/21 clones) of the non-sorted bulk population contained indels. We also found no off-target mutations in the non-targeted HLA-A32 allele (19 clones), which have 3 bp mismatches in the gRNA sequence (Figure 1F).

What are indels?  Looking it up, it's the molecular biology term for insertions or deletions of bases in the genome.  INsertions or DELetions.  I don't think I like this term, but whatever.  This section is titled "Enrichment of HLA-Edited Cells by IFN-gamma Treatment and Sorting", and it starts with the string, "To identify successful KO clones," which suggests that it's a verification step.  This is a particular section that I'm finding difficult to read.

As an alternative to HLA homozygous iPSCs, researchers have been using genome-editing technologies to knock out the b2-microglobulin (B2M) gene. B2M protein forms a heterodimer with HLA class I proteins and is required for HLA class I presen- tation on the cell surface (Gornalusse et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2013; Mandal et al., 2014; Riolobos et al., 2013). Hence, suppression of the B2M gene would prevent an immune response from cyto- toxic CD8+ T cells by depleting all HLA class I molecules (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -F, and -G).

This discusses a KO target for the gene editing.  B2M gene KO prevents the formation of HLA class I proteins on the surface of cells.  I'm not sure if that would or would not impair the construction of the peptide binding groove on dendritic cells.  I suspect this would fail to prevent the construction of the relevant self-identifying structure on the dendritic cells, as I believe HLA-2 proteins are specifically the ones being used for the peptide binding groove.  This suggests my entire endeavor would be *particularly* likely to produce nonviable mutant cells.  (As long as I think it would produce *any* cellular population I might still be interested in performing the experiment just to see what happens.)  Yet this also suggests an alternative avenue for my research, which is to study the construction of the peptide binding groove in more detail, to see if I can likewise knock out something that it depends upon in the way that cells rely upon B2M proteins for presenting HLA class I proteins on their surface.  Furthermore, depletion of HLA class I molecules may still be of interest to the final product, as these are (to my current inadequate understanding) self-identifying structures common to *all* cells.

I still haven't fully grasped this source.  I'm not sure whether to continue studying it, or if I should break away and dig for sources by which I can study the molecular biology of the dendritic cell surface proteins.

I'm ordering a copy of Clinical Immunology, Fifth Edition, and a few other texts on dendritic cells.  I need to keep studying the molecular biology of the dendritic cell surface proteins.

My textbook has arrived, and I've located the section of interest.  I'm trying to study the peptide binding groove chemistry using this textbook.  It's dense with unfamiliar terms, but I've already found something I wonder about.  Could I transpose the coding for a nonfunctional protein structure into the coding for the genes which assemble the peptide binding groove?  If the cell expresses a malformed groove which cannot bind peptide, that /may/ work.  If it's as easy as copying and pasting to get the body to produce a protein in the wrong place, at least.  I bet it's not.  Even if it is, I can't necessarily identify the correct protein.

I'm eying HLA-F in particular.  HLA-F is not expressed on the surface of most cells, but it is expressed on the cells around the placenta (trophoblasts), on naive immune cells that are replicating in an antigen-specific manner (lymphoblasts), and on stimulated memory T cells.  That last one is particularly of interest to me, since stimulated memory T cells produce antigenic materials, and need to not be attacked by the agitated immune system in their proximity.  Likewise, the immune system has many special resistances to attacking reproductive cells.  If the HLA-F surface expression prevents the immune system from attacking the cells that are expressing it, that might be an avenue which could be pursued for hypoallergenic transplant tissue engineering.

The HLA-F gene is encoded on a telomere of the HLA-A gene locus.  I thought telomeres were nonfunctional partition genes, but this encodes a protein functional in the immune system.  I'd hate to lose this telomere.

The HLA-F gene is 346 amino acids long.  Is that indicative of what I can replace it with?  What's the rule here?

As I'm learning to better visualize the peptide binding groove, this is looking harder rather than easier.  The immune system is frustratingly picky about immune matching.  No wonder present experiments focused on autologous dendritic cells...  certainly though, that doesn't mean a transgenic universal donor *wouldn't* be a breakthrough, if it's possible.  I wonder if I could do it as a PHD project.  A doctorate in immunology wasn't in my plans, but there's nothing offensive about the thought of it.

To specify the ideal a little better:  I think a dendritic cell population would be universal if it expressed HLA-2 proteins on its surface membrane only as a result of antigen processing.  This looks like it will be difficult to achieve.

 Do I correctly understand the cellular positioning and biological application of the HLA-2 proteins?  I first imagined the dendritic cell as a kind of carnivorous flower with a toothy mouth of The Peptide Binding Groove, which I now understand is not at all an accurate mental image.  My current imagination of the dendritic cell studs them with peptide binding grooves, some of which are empty and ready to react with potential antigenic surfaces in the intercellular media, and some of which are loaded with peptides ready to present to other immune cells.  I don't know if this mental image is or is not accurate.
 
 I'm concerned about the possibility that *all* of the HLA-2 proteins on the surface of the dendritic cell may have gotten there via processing peptides for presentation, in which case what is troubling about the interface between the dendritic cells and the

 This talks about the role of phagocytosis in filling out the MHC-2 interfaces on a dendritic cell, which I take as evidence favoring my conjecture that dendritic cells 'nibble' on other cells in order to pick up potential antigen proteins for cellular presentation.

  I read somewhere and need to find it again (or more information of the same kind, or counter-information) that the majority of the peptides presented by cells are of self-antigens.  This suggests that anergizing responses are actually the normal common response, and hostile immunoresponse happens in response to a minority of carried peptides.  I want to create a super-anergizer (the anergizing-specialist dendritic cell) in order to eliminate inappropriately learned responses.  That task is a little harder if anergizing interactions already predominate.
  
  I'm also concerned that anergizing-specialist dendritic cells may still 'nibble', and if they should in the process happen to eat any real antigens that the immune system ought to respond to, they'll still try to anergize that response as well.
  
  Silver lining, the anergizing-predominant immunoresponse model supports my conjecture that inappropriate autoimmune activation scenarios are based on thermodynamically improbable interactions, which in turn is a favorable indicator for the potential to rejuvenate the immune system.
  
  Hm.  If there's a way to cloak a cell-eater like a dendritic cell from the immune system, what stopped nature from weaponizing that potential before I ever thought of it?  There are bacteria whose evolutionary priorities would favor such a development, save possibly if it were hyper-competent enough to kill the host every time, which potentiality is not favorable for bacterial evolution.

Can the B27 proteins be induced to undergo benign misfolding such that they can be transited to the surface of the cell via golgi apparatus, but once there can neither present peptides nor be recognized as antigenic?  But then how would the modified cellular population present the peptides that I want it to present?

What if the universal donor population was edited to produce inert peptide presentors, but then was given the instructions for producing working presentation grooves simultaneously to the dose given to it of the peptides that we want it to produce for tolerogenesis?  Would this result in a dendritic cell that expresses mostly inert receptors, with a small population intensely focused on presenting the peptide chosen for tolerogenesis?

Perfection should not be necessary; if the dendritic cells get picked off by the immune system of the recipient at some rate, any rate of occurrence which doesn't trigger systemic immunoresponse would be good enough.

---
How about cleaning the cell surface?  How anodyne and featureless can cells get?  What happens in biology if a cell is inserted that tries to just not HAVE identifying features?

...more seriously, I wonder if knocking out all antigen-presenting receptors save the specific kind being utilized for a particular tolerogenesis application would reduce immunoresponse, permitting increased utilization of allotransplant DC.

This would be drastically easier if humanity all had one set of immune response genes, but a human population with only one set of immune response genes would have to be paranoid-aversive to disease, because monoculture hazard isn't only something that happens to banana plantations.

Are modern molecular biology simulations comprehensive enough to potentially discover by simulation a least reactive peptide binding groove on a per-target-antigen basis?  Admittedly, that's not 'universal' at all, and no longer has advantages over autologous dendritic cells.  It really looks like autologous dendritic cell therapies are superior... and achieving my universal donor cells would risk being so stealthy as to be biohazardous.  Which doesn't stop me from wanting to pull it off...  I would LOVE to invent a centrally manufacturable serum that can be shipped globally and administrated trivially.  I think the productivity gains from treatment of autoimmune diseases would be dramatic.

Hold on, if tolerogenic dendritic cells encourage antigen tolerance, why do we have to do *anything* to create a universal tolerogenic dendritic cell population?  Shouldn't tolerogenic-modified dendritic cells *always* be anergizing the responses they get?  Is it possible that *all* tolerogenic-modified dendritic cells are safe for allotransplants?

I don't think the experiments have been done yet.  For obvious reasons, and because it apparently violates the intuitions of molecular biologists already in the field, I would start with work on mice...

If *all* tolerogenic-modified dendritic cells are *not* safe for allotransplants, I would then try MHC-1 knockout dendritic cells in the same application.  Is it fair experimental design to trial three populations?  Into three separate groups of mice, I'd try transplanting unmodified dendritic cells, tolerogenic-modified dendritic cells, and tolerogenic MHC-1 knockout dendritic cells, recording different responses to each.

Tolerogenic MHC-1 knockout dendritic cells may be the 'universal serum' population I was trying to produce.  Pulse them with the antigen to be tolerated prior to application.

...there's only so much I can do with scholasticism.  Having an idea of what experiment I would like to perform is kind of frustrating, as I lack the resources to perform the experiment.  Also, those poor mice.  I don't think I'm heartless enough to inject something into mice that would probably sicken them.

I guess I should build an exact experimental protocol.  It'll need its own node.  [[Universal-tolerogenic-dendritic-cell-experiment-1]]?  Unwieldy...  Descriptive though, I'll wikify it.

Could studying the properties of misfolded proteins and cancerous mutations in the immune system reveal 'exploitable errors'?  There are various specific ways in which the immunoresponse can become incompetent.  To create my anergizing specialist cell population, I'm looking to create a specific kind of incompetent response so that the anergizing specialist cells can infiltrate the body and destroy cells that learned their role incorrectly.  As they're based on dendritic cells, which have a relatively short residency, the mutant specialist cells *themselves* should not turn tumorous, though of course all of this research should be pursued first on low subsapient forms of life.

I don't have specific ideas in mind here.  This is kind of a generic defense of "useless" experiments cataloguing the behavior of malfunctioning biology.

I'd love to see the full data for better comparison of the two approaches.  It does say that both of them *worked*... in CIA rats.

If allogeneic tolDCs work for therapeutic purposes, it may be feasible to target medicinal optimization towards strains of dendritic cells which perform well in culture, rather than trying to use only histocompatible tolDCs.  My fantasy here is cultivating a central serum population and globally distributing standard treatments derived from it.

More research on allogeneic tolDCs!  This time I have access.

It looks like a favorable result, though as it is presently nearing midnight, I should go to bed rather than continuing to study.  I just did a bout of searching to alleviate a sense of anxious confusion which had arisen about my experimental objective, heh.
