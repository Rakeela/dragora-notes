# Notes on Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells

This is a companion file to the essays that I'm currently attempting to write about tolerogenicity, [[a-general-protocol-for-tolerogenic-rna-vaccination]] and [[tolerogenic-rna-vaccination-vs-dendrispecific-rna-vaccination]].  The most promising thing that I've noticed is that I may be able to prove dendrispecificity of RNA vaccines.  I haven't necessarily gotten to it first, but I also haven't found it in the literature yet.  It's an inference I plucked from some raw data.  That's exciting.  And yet...

And yet tolerogenic dendritic cells are an anti-senescence advance, the kind of thing which might by mastery give to all of medicine a little more breathing room by making people healthier in a stable, productive, no-downsides kind of way.  Studying tolerogenic dendritic cells is very exciting and pushing that tech forward is great.  Sure, I'll *also* try to demonstrate that a new technique gains useful features by highly dendrispecific interactions with the immune system, but I don't see a link between dendrispecific RNA vaccinations and full-fledged longevity advances the way I see such a link for tolerogenic RNA vaccinations.

This is a general review document covering potential tolerogenicity scenarios for dendritic cells.  It's a great study resource that talks about the mechanisms of the cells as well as the open questions in the field - at least as of four years ago.  Four years is not huge in medical research chronology; I'm excited by the recency of this material!

It looks like there may have been a trial of an HIV treatment using autologous dendritic cells?  In that case, establishing therapeutic safety for dendritic cell interventions may be more straightforward than expected, reducing the extent of the research timelines involved in bringing a new immunoresponse tuning technology to market.

This is a phase 1 clinical trial for tolerogenic dendritic cells.  Apparently it's already being studied in humans.  If there are any complete researches...

Agh.  I'm so, so tired.  I'm teary-eyed and in pain, hah.  I want this research to work because I want this to be the answer to *my* problems.  I want to stop having forever-aches and I want to stop taking anti-inflammatories daily.  That's why I care more about tolerogenic dendritic cells generally than I do about proving something novel about dendrispecificity in RNA vaccines.  If I were *already* entirely healthy rather than dreaming of someday *being* entirely healthy, I would turn my focus onto the thing that gave me dead searches when I tried to query archives to figure out if anyone else had noticed what I had noticed.  I can't tell if I'm doing the right thing by letting myself get distracted by the selfish health interest instead of the greater potential scientific novelty.  I can tell that I'm really struggling with productivity today.  It's 4PM and my day barely felt like it had time to happen in.

What can I even do that would be novel in this space?  The procedures are laid out well enough that I feel like I could conceivably bootleg a trial.  I wouldn't, of course; it'd be a lot of work for no gain.  

Are the procedures optimal?  This goes to my work on [[a-general-protocol-for-tolerogenic-rna-vaccination]], which is my best current hope for finding a novel contribution to the research on tolerogenic RNA vaccination.  I think that a single efficient and generalizable process can be defined which can be tested for safety only once, sidestepping some of the repetitive/duplicative research.  Not that replications are worthless, but I have an impossible selfish interest in seeing a result sooner than later.

Yet I'm having trouble studying.  I'm in pain, and psychologically, everything that alleviates pain undoes a lot of its own gain by being distracting.  I actually *didn't* use cannabis today, and I believe that skipping it made me *less* productive in studying.

If tolerogenic dendrites permit excess/unwanted autoimmune responses to be shut off, will this enable a greater use of induced autoimmunity in medicine?  I wouldn't want to give people more net inflammation, but shifting the immune system's autoimmune targeting towards something useful (such as clearing out cells with the senescent phenotype) could be useful.  Is there anything about the surface proteins of [[senescent cells]] which could be loaded into an RNA vaccine to serve as a new immunotarget?

(2019, Aug 7)  Infection of Dendritic Cells with Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominissuis Exhibits a Functionally Tolerogenic Phenotype in Response to Toll-Like Receptor Agonists via IL-10/Cox2/PGE2/EP2 Axis.  *Frontiers in Microbiology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-12.)

If I really want my *General Protocol* to be a breakthrough, perhaps I can determine how *this* works.  Condensing tolerogenesis to a single injection might be possible using information derived from the study of Mycobacterium avium subspecies hominisuis (MAH).

I feel a little overwhelmed by this material, but if I'm understanding it correctly, the MAH-infected dendritic cells expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at a higher level, which resulted in them interfering with immunoresponse rather than encouraging it.  This however talks about treating the dendritic cells with LPS, which if it refers to lipopolysaccharides (aka endotoxins, found in the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria) refers to something that is...  oh, that's the major outer membrane protein of MAH, which is a gram-negative bacteria.  This suggests that if the dendritic cells are attacking an MAH infection, the ones that have already been infected will turn tolerogenic as they're processing the MAH membrane proteins.

This asserts strongly that the (a?) tolerogenic phenotype of dendritic cells was (in this case?) induced by Interleukin 10 (IL-10).  It further traces the causality to cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2), by asserting that a Cox2 inhibitor (celecoxib) prevented production of IL-10.  This establishes Cox2-mediation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as the cause of the infected cells producing more IL-10 and becoming tolerogenic dendritic cells.  Applying a blocker against EP2 receptors also prevented IL-10 production, suggesting that PGE2 binding at EP2 was signalling for IL-10 production.  Does that generalize sufficiently that a dendrispecific EP2 agonist could be used to induce tolerogenic dendrite development?

Geffner, J.  Ceballos, A.  (2012, Nov 15.)  Semen promotes the differentiation of tolerogenic dendritic cells.  *Journal of Immunology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-12.)

I was looking for information about EP2 agonists, and I found this.  It's not especially relevant, but I've included it for interest's sake.  It talks about why sexually transmitted diseases transfer so well - by piggyback on semen-induced tolerogenesis.

The actual paper does speak somewhat about the chemodynamics of EP2 receptors, so I could conceivably return to it, though at a glance it doesn't look like it contains the information I was looking for at this time.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630103/  (Flórez-Grau, J.  Cabezón, R.  Borgman, KJE.  España, C.  Lozano, JJ.  Garcia-Parajo, MF.  Benítez-Ribas, D.  (2017, Sep.)  Up-regulation of EP2 and EP3 receptors in human tolerogenic dendritic cells boosts the immunosuppressive activity of PGE2.  *Journal of Leukocyte Biology*.  Retrieved 2021-2-12.)

This talks about tolerogenic dendritic cells having up-regulated expression of EP2 and EP3 receptors, which induce IL-10 production when agonized.  It concludes by suggesting that EP receptor agonists/antagonists might be relevant to designing novel drug templates to modulate immune response.

I think it also suggests something for tolerogenesis, and I wonder if...  I wonder if I'm being very foolish thinking about generating tolerogenic dendritic cells by any in situ process.  It would risk general immunosuppression while the tol-dcs lived, without good targeting.  I think I've chased the wrong angle here and found nothing to reduce the need for autologous dendritic cell therapy to achieve controlled tolerogenesis.  At best, studying these mechanisms may indicate a different potential mechanism for inducing the tolerogenic phenotype.

If I had a research budget for trying to produce my *General Protocol*, I would want to take a stop-watch and start figuring out how long it takes different tolerogenic-induction processes to complete, including all process labor steps.  Not to mention that it would produce a burst of general excitement for replicating the work of other scientists - it'd be part of a substantive project itself.  The micro-optimizing business methods style is underappreciated for its power to make an achievement out of what is otherwise likely to be an unrewarding investment in redoing existing research.

Tolerogenesis induction was not, however, the most important part of this..  I also don't understand how to go from potentially antigenic surfaces to RNA coding that causes dendritic cells to manifest those surfaces.  I want to define an I/O operation, where the input is a self-immune response to a defined antigenic surface, and the output is a step-by-step process for producing a tolerogenic dendritic cell population specialized in quelling immunoresponse to that antigenic surface.

Hypothetically, a strain of *hypoallergenic* dendritic cells might get away from the additional time and labor involved in working with autologous dendritic cells, but I have no idea about the feasibility of that.

How  do researchers discover what proteins a particular RNA sequence codes for?  I don't even know if this is a basic question or an advanced question.  Looking up the process of gene expression itself, RNA strands are shorn from the helix by a duplicative chemical process (the DNA helix is not itself destroyed) and the shorn duplicate is read by a ribosome that outputs a polypeptide according to the RNA strand.

When we put an antigen surface protein to a dendritic cell in the form of RNA, we're giving the cell the RNA that codes for a particular polypeptide sequence.  Is it just one sequence, which the cell then sticks to its outer membrane?  Is it multiple sequences to assemble a protein?  How many strips of RNA go into an RNA vaccine?  To what extent are the target antigenic surfaces just polypeptide sequence vs to what extent are they complex folded proteins?

This is COVID-19 research.  I'm looking at it, because I'm wondering how a particular strand of RNA was identified as coding for the coronavirus spike protein.  It doesn't look like it has the right information...  I need to keep searching.

I wonder if defining this research process the way I want to would put together the substance of a textbook.

Retrieved 2021-2-12.)

(Quoted from source abstract.)
"A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016."

This looks more like what I was looking for.  This is talking about the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of a different (although closely related) virus.  This talks a little about its creation, specifying that the protein was grown in yeast.  I'm guessing that this is the generality: transgenic yeast are used to express bits of DNA to see what they produce with it.  This gives citations 4-6 for this, suggesting that I can find more about the specific manufacturing processes if I can dig into the bibliography of this research.

Something about discovering that this involves yeast makes me feel like my thoughts about using yeast to breed enhanced xenomitochondria strains might have been really on-point.  That's off-topic, but go me, I still want to do some work with bioreactors down the line.

I kind of like how all my thoughts on this are in a 'technically indeterminate' mode.  I haven't published anything yet.  I could be really wrong without having strongly declared any position.

Digging for more of the manufacturing research, I've found this.  It confirms transgenic yeast used to replicate proteins.  I'm still trying to determine if it somehow reveals information about the methods of recombinant protein construction.  I don't feel like I'm learning about that here, but I do feel like I just learned something that I'm actually searching for.  I may want to add another 'notes-on' file to represent my study of recombinant protein construction more directly, returning this file to a purer focus on tolerogenic dendritic cells.

I'm concerned that there may be a critical reason to need this research done sooner rather than later, and implemented faster rather than slower.  I believe on the basis of my current understanding that brain implants are likely to be pro-inflammatory on the neural environment, and that brain inflammation is intimately linked to the progression of mental disorders.  As a transhumanist, I want to see the mind-machine interface thing done *very well*, yet I'm now concerned that if brain implantation technology accelerates ahead of immunoresponse tuning technology the risk of injuries and illnesses resulting from brain implantation procedures will be considerably increased.  We may be inviting an era of mad cyborg diseases if we don't learn how to tell the immune system to stop attacking things before we add new things to the self-environment of the body.

Brain implantation research really wants to operate more on the consumer technology research cycle (fast and loose with occasional fatalities because cool ideas are implemented before they're safe) rather than on the medical technology research cycle (so painstakingly slow that people die preventably because doctors are afraid to kill anyone by rushing technology).  That disconnect might be a problem if tolerogenesis research can't be accelerated.

I say this knowing that accelerating tolerogenesis research reduces the likelihood that I'll have anything novel to contribute.  I'm studying it *as a student* right now.  This project exists as a study aid.

BTW, the fact that projects can function as study aids is something that I think should be used as a justification for people to be allowed to take on projects 'beyond their status'.  I've run into the taboo of being treated as arrogant because I dared think about things that people of my role in life were not allowed to think about; growing up, I would never have expected that to be possible in a nation as advanced as *America*, as that particular moralism was presented in the literature of my youth as a trait of primitive foreign nations!  Yet I'm now aware by experience that people really do bend their lives around it sometimes, so I'd like to say, consider that science depends on research replication.  The same work has to be done repeatedly over time to make it stable and well-trusted.  This is obviously true when people maintain physical machinery, but sometimes less obvious when people are maintaining structures of concept and cognition.  If people take on a research project that can't possibly prove anything new, but they're doing it with their own resources, any such work should be honored.  Sometimes research projects that can't prove anything new should be pursued by organizations with substantive resources as well, though it is beyond me to judge the optimal rate for that.

This is a protocol document for how to extract dendritic cells from a sample.  This is the kind of thing I want to improve or extend.  This affirms my usage of the word 'protocol' for describing such documents and suggests that using the word protocol in future searches may be productive, as may a more intent review of *Current Protocols in Immunology*.

The use of sheep's blood admixtures is intriguing.  What an unexpectedly alchemical inclusion in a modern scientific process!

I'm having some trouble finding "UNIT 7.1" in the material, which would explain the most basic step in the protocol, but I've noticed something rendering this non-optimal.  For optimal deployment of tolerogenic dendrite, the purification of the sample should ideally in some manner continue until it has secured a population wholly of immature dendritic cells.  If I have to produce that myself, the likelihood that my protocol requires laboratory work to verify increases very dramatically.

...how immunoreactive would someone else's transplanted dendritic cells be?  Don't try that on a human.  If some kind of 'universal donor' dendritic cells could be found or defined, then curing immune disorders could be reduced to an injection from a common standard transplant population maintained in bioreactors at every hospital.  Can the need of autologous dendritic cells be eliminated?
