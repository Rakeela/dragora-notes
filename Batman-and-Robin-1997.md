#Batman-and-Robin-1997

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I still remember a few traces of this movie, even though I saw it when it was new.  I'm shocked that it's considered so terrible.  Trivia:  I could've sworn "Kiss from a Rose" was used in this movie for a romance subplot between Poison Ivy and Batman.  I must be misremembering.  Memory is strange.

I don't know how many of the Batman movies I've seen.  I don't think I've seen many of them.
