The discussions are posted in advance.
Discussion #1 - Introduction - Open Jan 4 - Due Jan 7 - I've posted here already, which I believe meets minimum engagement, though I should look again if I have any spare moments. - Link: [[Envs&100Disc1-Introduction]]
Discussion #2 - Climate Change - Open Jan 7 - Due Jan 14 - I drafted something, but my search for citations suggests that I'll need to amend it before I can consider it a finished essay. - Link: [[Envs100Disc2-ClimateChange]]
Discussion #3 - Renewable Energy - Open Jan 14 - Due Jan 21 - Note that the teacher has requested that this essay be specifically structured. - Link: [[Envs100disc3-RenewableEnergy]]
Discussion #4 - Pandemic Blues and Silver Linings - Open Jan 21 - Due Jan 28 - Thank goodness, less mandatory structure this time.  Kind of personal, more low-key, but still requiring citations?  Teacher misspelled pre-pandemic. - Link: [[Envs100disc4-PandemicBlues]]
Discussion #5 - Northwest Ecology - Open Jan 28 - Due Feb 4 - This is elsewhere in the course listed as "endangered speicies" (sic) so I'm uncertain of the actual subject.

--- Social justice and environmental policy
It's petty, but I'm frustrated by spelling errors such as "Environemental Justice" in the course.  I know it doesn't lower the fundamental quality of the video linking social justice and environmental policy together, but it's unpleasant.
Speaking of that video, it does have a good point.  Part of what agitates against egalitarian outcomes IRL is the tyranny of land values.  People who don't have resources are obligated to live where land values are low.  Whatever is holding down land values very often holds down life outcomes.  The video in particular focused on how impoverished areas are often cited in undesirable land near industrial development, and how the importance of clean industry in producing an environment where poverty doesn't get perpetuated by land values (in this particular way) is often neglected.  It also talked about how the flourishes in environmental policy - the city parks and treeplanting endeavors - are often focused in the areas that are already very wealthy and clean.
I'm not sure that's true, but my counter-evidence is only how I play city simulator games.  I've always tried to use city parks and forested areas to insulate residential areas from industrial areas.  Yet I certainly don't know to what extent this is done in the real world, and the world contains many pictures of ugly residential structures next to industrial areas.  It seems to be very probably a domain in which cities could improve their policies to reduce factors promoting long-term differences in public health.  It's unfair that those who are already poor are so often the very people forced to suffer the greatest health expenses and concomitant losses in productivity.
