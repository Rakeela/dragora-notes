High pain day today.  I've lost about two hours so far to not being able to do much.  Sitting in one spot.  A bit of pacing around.  Laying on the stairs.  Heavy exhaustion, non-localized pain (ie, "ow my everything").  I've only just taken painkillers.  I resist doing so.

I intend to try that cheese thing today despite pain.  I bought some raclette.  I'll see how it goes with the double boiler, and if I can coax it to combine with cacao butter.

I have not yet figured out how to make cheese combine with cacao butter.  The two products very much want to separate in the melting pot.  I've put in an order for sodium alginate, which may be the emulsifier that I need to make cheese-based fudges.

I think tonight I'll try using some keto cheesecake fake milkshake mix that wasn't very good as a beverage to make my next batch of fudge.  It should produce a neutral sweet flavor that I can use as a base to make a citrus white chocolate fudge.
