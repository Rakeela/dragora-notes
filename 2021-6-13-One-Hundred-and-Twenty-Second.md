High pain day today.  I've lost about two hours so far to not being able to do much.  Sitting in one spot.  A bit of pacing around.  Laying on the stairs.  Heavy exhaustion, non-localized pain (ie, "ow my everything").  I've only just taken painkillers.  I resist doing so.

I intend to try that cheese thing today despite pain.  I bought some raclette.  I'll see how it goes with the double boiler, and if I can coax it to combine with cacao butter.

I have not yet figured out how to make cheese combine with cacao butter.  The two products very much want to separate in the melting pot.
