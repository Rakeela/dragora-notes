03:56.  Instead of a dream, I wrote.  I wrote fixedly for what felt like hours, and I got four chapters into a violent new litRPG, very little of which I now remember.  The system granted bonuses for fighting "moderately disorientated" (as the protagonist thought of it) with the Panic Mode mechanic, and the protagonist had just unlocked an ability that transformed his "semblance" into the appearance of himself in his original species at the cost of cancelling Panic Mode.  He wondered if this seemingly hard to use ability could be used to make his own wounds seem to heal, giving him the chance to bluff at enemies and pretend to be capable of self-healing.  It could, but this thought on the part of the protagonist was the last thing I was writing before I woke up, so I didn't get a chance to use it.  I can't remember what exactly I was thinking with the ability, but it was clearly only a "semblance" transformation, not a true one.  An illusion.  Unfathomably, I called it "Jijy no Rag", which is the name of a piece of music from Phantasy Star 4.  Dreams.  It probably wasn't my best writing, but there was still such a sense of loss to have written determinedly for so long and then to wake up discovering it was just a dream.

04:06.  Yesterday was a sick day.  I mixed up my medications, slept very little at night, and then slept for most of the day.  I did no writing.

04:08.  I'm not sure I literally got four chapters into that story I was writing in last night's dream.  It just seemed like that much writing.  Sensibly, it'd be two chapters.  I don't write four chapters in five hours.  Four chapters is a hyperbolic estimate.

04:15.  15,112 words on the file.  0 words on the chapter.

06:26.  16,028.  915 words on the chapter.

06:44.  16,295.  1,182 words on the chapter.

07:31.  17,093.  1,980 words on the chapter.

08:24.  17,726.  2,613 words on the chapter.  

08:28.  17,755.  2,639 words on the chapter.  2,643 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  0 words on the chapter.

08:31.  Hm.  I have not written more in the last three minutes.  About four hours and fifteen minutes.  Maybe time to take a break?

11:14.  I napped on the couch, then I felt terribly so I binged on Oreos.  9 Oreos demolished.  I lost count and even had to recount the pack.

11:33.  More Oreos down.  Another five consumed.  I think that was five.  Who can't count to five?  Me!  I'm not drunk, I'm just being wildly, stupidly impulsive.  There's another four stacked up.  I'll just eat these.

11:35.  One more.  Maybe.  One more for the moment.  Stashing Oreos away in a vault was dumb.  I don't want Oreos.

11:48.  A browser window opened without my having opened it.  It opened on the website I was already using, but to a part of that website I had never been to, with no apparent link between where I was and where it went.  I'm suspicious of that.  Since I can't usefully do anything about my suspicions, I'm just going to eat more Oreos.  That's another three down.  I'll just chase them with three more.

11:52.  I'm just going to finish off the pack.

13:25.  Wow.  I am just made of depression today.  I did my basic writing and ran into a wall.  I should've drank another energy drink instead of napping earlier.  That nap really didn't help this time.  A third energy drink would've been healthier.

13:31.  I just realized I forgot to take my antidepressant this morning.

14:28.  It took a while for the antidepressant to kick in, but I think I can really feel it today.  I still feel a bit agitated and unhappy, though.  I feel a bad energy from all the sugar that I ate.  Feels like doom.  Nobody can lose weight freaking out and eating 31 Oreos.  That's over 2k calories of Oreos.

14:29.  A VN project that I like seems to have taken up a lighthouse in their logo.  I'm suspicious!

14:39.  Okay, that's enough VN for now.  Back to writing.  17,915 words on the file.  160 words on the chapter.

16:16.  19,011.  1,256 words on the chapter.  3,899 words of progress.

16:24.  A music player that I've been listening to for five hours randomly started looping a track called "Graveyard Investigations". The loop track button wasn't even highlighted.

17:56.  19,068.  I had a pleasant shower.

18:33.  19,853.  2,054 words on the chapter.

19:36.  21,271.  3,470 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.  0 words on the chapter.

21:52.  21,408.  6,296 words of progress.  Done for the night.

22:00.  I'm analyzing my candy preferences tonight and I'm realizing that I like things with a soft bite, like certain mainstream candy bars, certain truffle bars, and marshmallows.  All these fine candies are mostly disappointing.

(This bit added the next day.)  I wrote 'fine candies' when I should've said 'fine chocolates'.  The better chocolates disappoint me.  Anyways.  11.3 miles.  1,973 kcal.  40,288 steps.  8 hours, 43 minutes, 55 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.
