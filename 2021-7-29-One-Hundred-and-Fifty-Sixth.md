There's this one author who creates really terrible "erotic" Twine games...  I won't give their name, but I kind of admire them.  I put "erotic" in quotation marks, because even though write about sex, hot writing is not their hallmark.  I'd say they've written one game that has any decent erotic content, and the rest of it is just too abrupt and bizarre to be actually sexy.  It's more like sex-themed gonzo comedy.  That one game they made with any art to it?  Some of that one is also just gonzo.  I admire them for the sheer silliness of what they make.

I was never able to write anything like that.  Taking it more seriously was the only way to push past the anxiety boundaries as I was supposed to.  The gonzo style would've struck me as "concealed hatred" back then.  I still wonder if people hide traps in writing like that.  It doesn't take much love to produce it.

I used to study erotic games with intense fixation.  It's "what I was supposed to do" and I was supposed to be learning how to make them, too.  I hated that.  I felt horrible about it.  Predictably, that was never a good emotional basis for making any myself, and that community used me up destructively whenever I touched it.  I'm still considered an edible victim who the mind-rapist set can abuse for their pleasure, because I'm willing to be honest about having been sexually mistreated by "good liberals".  I'm not *allowed* to value sexual liberalism as I do; it must be a *lie* that I value sexual liberalism as I do; I'm only allowed to be a lying slut.

Well, I'm not a lying slut, and I still value sexual liberalism very highly.  In fact, I still think that the society which produced a bunch of erotic games was, on average, a good society.  That society IS what I needed as a child... statistically speaking.  It was bad for me, but it was good on average.  It reduced exactly the kind of abuse that happened to me.  I'm not totally sure how, but the "degenerate" sexually liberal societies produced a more asexuality-tolerating society with less inclination to sexually abuse kids than the sexual conservativism it replaced.  People using contraceptives to have more sex ended up having fewer kids and loving the kids they had more than the people who opposed them as supposed degenerates.

At this point, I think the evidence is strong enough that conservatives are depraved for not valuing sexual morality enough to be porn-favoring asexual-tolerating sexual liberals.  There's a cuddles-positive society described in [[the-ethical-slut]] that I brushed up against and which would've rescued me in a heartbeat if it'd known I was suffering in a bad analogue of its own protective embrace.  The foundational right of sex-positivity is the right to say 'no' and not be involved in anything that people don't consent to.  Somehow, all the weird and wild porn in the world is part of that.  That's why I think it's an essential liberty.

I'm writing this, because sometimes I still wish I could've been able to write what I was supposed to.  It wouldn't have done any good then when it was a coerced performance, but I never was opposed to the *liberty* of people to write it, and I'm upset that my own civil rights were taken away by people opposed to my having any sexual pleasure as part of the retaliation for other people getting sexually bored of my attempts to perform under blackmail to entertain them.  The stalker set's attempt to cock-block me was something I appreciated for the first months of it as it freed me from sexual harassment and blackmail more profoundly than anything else could've.  They were so far up their asses that they truly believed that letting me off the hook was something I'd be unhappy about.  Something about that puts me in the mind of Tom Sawyer whitewashing a fence... though a better likeness is Brer Rabbit begging not to be thrown into the briar bush.

I didn't *want* to write it before.  It wasn't my will, and it was wrong that I wasn't allowed to have my own will.  Yet I don't want to be held to account if it ever *is* my will to write such things, just as I wouldn't want to stop anyone else from doing it in actuation of their own will.  I should've had the freedom not to do it then, and I wasn't allowed to not do it.  If I ever do want to do it in the future, I should be allowed to do that.  I never had a problem with sex-positivity that wasn't aptly summarized as, "But what if I don't want sex?"

Now, from this vantage point?  **I finally appreciate the gonzo stuff.**  The totally wacky not-taking-it-seriously approach that still touches me with the faintest whiff of hostility?  I want to produce something at *that* quality.  It still feels to me like it did, but now that feeling feels like something I would want to express.  That buried hostility isn't an off-note to me anymore now that I know what it's like to have the whole matter touched with bitterness.

Parody is discouraging.  I *know* this.  If I'm wrong about the effect of parody, it's an error that I am making with undue conviction.  (Mea culpa; we all do.)  Parodists use up material and exhaust it.  In politics, parodists can often (usually?) admit to their antipathies, and they can be open about trying to use up the material they don't like.  In porn, the impression I've gotten is that most people who draw or write something claim instead to love their subject matter, no matter how parodic they take it.  It's legitimately difficult to tell a parodist from an extreme fetishist.  Maybe it's impossible.  Maybe it's unnecessary.  I think extreme fetishists use up their material just like parodists who know what they're doing.  *Extreme fetishists* are discouraging, and it's part of why they're just a wacky part of the internet rather than something actually harmful.

A specific example which bothered me years ago that bothers me no longer: a million parodies of condom misuse didn't promote actual misuse of condoms, even though that's some peoples' fetish.  They were using up the material.  They were sapping the *misuse* of condoms.  They were holding the groundwork in place for liberals to keep promoting condoms in the real.  That was a resonant one to me, because that was one of *my* fetishes.  I had no interest in doing it IRL, because I was already antinatalistic, and I was already disinterested in ever having human descendants.  (For that matter, I'm not interested in having sex with humans; as I've said many times, y'all're ugly.)  So I thought about what it meant, and it gave me pause...  I eventually realized it seemed to be inspiring backlash... and the backlash wasn't exactly conservative or restrictive.  It was artful.  As writers author both heroes and villains, in art the good and bad are represented together, and art leads towards progress by the gentle hand of showing truth without telling people what to think.

A specific example which still bothers me, and which I'm contemplating attacking with my own parody: Estrus.  I'm from a species *with* an estrus cycle.  Nearly all porn that touches on this mishandles it as "estrus flips the temporary slut switch".  I didn't comment negatively on that years ago because years ago I wasn't supposed to comment negatively on anything sexual.  I didn't use parody to "not" comment negatively, because I'm opposed to doing anything that I can't admit that I'm doing, and I can't admit to such a motive if I can't comment negatively.  For God's sake, I wasn't even supposed to think critically about reproduction.  Nander, Madison, and Jacel all (tried to) require me to be natally interested in them, and reproductive interest was considered to have this mandatory identity with heat-play interest.

So I've got a game concept in mind that works at the gonzo level, would not take excessively long to write, and would express my misgivings with how the concept of the estrus cycle has been artistically (mis)handled without shaming anyone who enjoys it.

I wonder if I should actually do it.

Growing a small number of chive plants turns out to not require a lot of day-to-day effort, and to leave me with a lot of spare time, so I've certainly time to write something if I choose to.  They're sprouting nicely so far, although they're still too small for me to feel comfortable plucking them up to check their root development.  I do hope I'm not being too shy... but then, finding out how I mishandle them is what the test grow is for, prior to the research grow from which I hope to derive results.
