# 2020-11-30-Fifth

I spent today doing math homework.  When I was a child, doing six hours of math homework was a nightly occurrence, but that is not the school's fault.  I believe a very primary reason why doing math homework took so long was because of my untreated bad health.  I was collapsing over the work and having no idea what was wrong with me.  Now I understand what I mentioned in [[2020-11-19-First]], which is that I need to take potassium when I start collapsing.  Potassium supplements make mathematical calculation possible for me.

My sleep-wake schedule also fell apart, and I had no idea why I was waking and sleeping "at-random"; what has since been identified as a 26-hour circadian rhythm felt then like a shifting hell.  (I will always be grateful to the sleep doctor who saw the stripe in my CPAP data, being able to rationally identify that pattern enabled me so much!)  It was a very great struggle to find a way through that, but now I have something that nearly entirely works.  I take bupropion in the morning and melatonin in the evening.  This has proven a nearly-functional chronobiotic regimen...  Staying day-aligned is still frustratingly difficult, but no longer impossible.  (I greatly prefer to be diurnal.)  Regularizing my schedule was for years my belief about the minimum qualification I would need to achieve in order to attempt a return to education.  As I've now (sufficiently) regularized it, I've been back to class, and doing much better than my worst anxieties had suggested I would.

It may also help that I have a safer environment here than the one I grew up in, too.  People with no apparent cause to have any awareness of me have done a lot of stupid, bizarrely desperate things to hurt me emotionally, and that's basically something that has been so consistent its part of my basic assumptions about human motivations, but at least that's only emotional hazard.  I've only been assaulted three times in adulthood!  (I've said twice in another context, but I just retallied and realized that I could only say twice by inconsistently classifying tow of the events.)

Assaults were a regular thing in childhood.  They came from other children, mostly.  I was supposed to make friends with people who attacked me, tch.  I was treated as a source of violence, but I was *always* a [[pacifist]].  My father encouraged moderate pacifism; defend yourself, but don't aggress.  He might've done me better to encourage me to only dodge and run, but I can't be too hard on that detail.  I credit him as one of the only pacifistic influences in a violent childhood.  He ranks all the way down as merely the 8th most violent person I knew, and he was the only person I knew who cussed bitterly about other people being violent when they ought to have been thinking things through.

About the causes of all that childhood violence?  I was scapegoated hard.  Being in fights made me red-out briefly every time, and my thoughts were disrupted enough by that such that I couldn't immediately account for the events.  The actual events always recurred to me, but too late to be charismatic; the real story of each fight (I was usually just ambushed for no apparent reason) only ever came out on the very rare occasion when bystanders were willing to speak about it.  I also tended to spend a few hours crying helplessly after each time I was attacked, which prevented me from speaking coherently at all when it happened.  Incapable of speaking in my own defense, and with no advocates among the many witnesses most of the fights had, I was blamed for nearly every single fight I was in.  I guess I was assumed to have been crying because I picked a fight and lost?  I didn't start *any* of them.  My school engagement with fighting was speaking bitterly about other people being violent when they ought to have been thinking things through.  I was at that time given to a more oratorial style rather than my father's cussing, but it was the same sentiment.

The last time I got a red-out, by the way, it was more of a chroma-out.  I experienced that last school fight in a color-cycling darkness with a dark-on-black awareness of what was going on.  The experience was as trippy and hard to process as it sounds, but it was still a major increase in conscious awareness compared to a red-out.  I suffered no memory disruption that time, though I believe I still cried helplessly for a long time afterwards.  (I find the concept of enjoying a real fight inconceivable.)  Barring concussing myself by falling off a bike, I've had nothing since that I'd describe as a traumatic shift in consciousness.

Why am I talking so much about that unsafe environment, after I introduced the day's activity with math homework?  Well, I believe I'm also still talking about why my ability to do math fell apart.  It's a totally different experience now.  Doing math work lately has actually started to feel enjoyable.  I'm still doing remedial algebra, but I didn't miss out for the usual reason.  I've always had the mental faculty for algebraic shifts.  I think the only reason I hated math at all is that I was stressed horrifically in childhood.  I had the fighting, I had the collapsing, and I was already constantly in pain...  Lately, I'm working on simplifying problems.  I'm working with weird components while sifting the algebraic pattern towards a defined minimum.  I don't always understand why every involved operation is considered "simpler", but I do still find it intuitive to shift problems towards the "simplified" structure, like it's an entropic minimum in a complex system.

At this point, I've gotten past the last of the material I learned in childhood, but which I was too disordered in mind and body to prove my knowledge of.  A frustration that had clung to me through remedial work is off my shoulders now.  Learning entirely new rules and operations (working with radicands) has actually felt fun in a way that my classes never felt when I was spending all my time in school feeling sick or scared.  Experiencing that for the first time at age 31 is nice, but it has a bittersweet tinge.  If I'd been born into a physically safer world, I may have naturally developed into the kind of person who had *always* found math fun.  Had I instead been born into a world of every hazard I faced save that it had better medical technology, I still could've been rescued into becoming such a person at an age when it would've made sense to people, and I would've entered college at age 17 enthusiastically pursuing science classes.

I don't think I'm speaking one word improbable in this retrospective counterfactual.  I remember contemplating philosophy at age four, thinking about the nature of thought and being, that I was capable of thinking... and I remember when at age five, I decided to steal a candy bar "to test a hedonic conjecture".  I did not speak those words to anyone else.  I remember the pastor at my local church, who became one of my favorite adults in part by gifting me books on stoicism and hedonism (the ancient greek philosophies).  Yet at age four, I don't know where in all the world I could have overheard words about the nature of thought and being, because those sentiments were not part of my rough, poor, edge-of-ruralia childhood.  I cannot count it among the truths that this world had to teach me that I ought to prioritize above all else the life of the mind.  It seems to have been so innately true to me that, had I not found the words to describe such a preference, I would have made them up myself.

Sweet:  Math is more fun than I remember.  Bitter:  If we'd had more [[transhumanist]] medicine when I was young, the world may have been richer in the last decade by one scientist, and if we'd had a more pacifist society that advanced medical technology may not even have been necessary.  Bittersweet:  Hope.
