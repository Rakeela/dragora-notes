# 2021-2-8-Twenty-Sixth

One of my teachers at college has seen this archive... and complained that the internal linking doesn't work.  She's right.  The links only work for me, using them within my archive editor.  To navigate between pages publicly, it's necessary to click across them.  To have a readily navigable version of this archive, people have to clone the archive.

I went through and turned on Github Pages in an attempt to fix the issue, but my commitment level to the issue is currently low.  I feel a little confused by this task and my thoughts are elsewhere.  It is ultimately my own archive, only incidentally(/tauntingly) public, and it does at root serve the purpose of my thoughts rather than having the publishing factor as its primary objective.  I'd be a little more enthusiastic about doing more reorganization work, such as by linking together the day-posts into their own top-level structure ala [[authors-writing]].

I've thought about what I'm doing lately in a more [[dragon]] context, and I know what pattern I'm running.  It's Kairn's.  He was a golden-scaled dragon who lived untransformed *as* a dragon in the public square.  This was something he did in a society that feared and hated dragons.  He expressed a fatalistic attitude towards the risk of being killed for this, and a strange moralistic commitment that essentially amounted to, "Yes, I might die for being obvious, but I won't deserve it when it happens."  And he didn't!  He didn't die to the attackers he thought would eventually kill him, but he died horribly in retaliation for something that didn't merit the death penalty, to an attack lead by an aggressor who wouldn't have known where to find him if he weren't living in a big church in the middle of town.

Kairn was a priest of a wind goddess.  He didn't believe in her, but he believed in virtue and the worth of theology.  He was lean among the dragons of The Wheel (our community; the name of our defensive alliance was 'The Wheel'); he did too little business and spent too much of his money on food.  He did this not for that he was gluttonous, but for that he was unwilling to engage violently with any creature.  He found his life persistently and frustratingly boring, but he continued with dedication, because he believed in the necessity of showing the world a dragon who was not a threat and did not deserve to die.  He was part of a larger faith with open churches in other communities as well; he was a missionary, joining The Wheel to try to draw us from the darkness.

Well, I've realized he was right.  I *was* Kairn.  His endeavors, though difficult in many ways, were less vulnerable to disruption and of a more reliably benevolent trajectory than the endeavors of the rest of us.  While the rest of The Wheel watched society in hateful suspicion and pretended not to exist, pretended not to see anything or be seen by anyone, Kairn was very often at ease, and concealed almost nothing of his actions and activities.  I say 'almost' nothing; The Wheel was a sexual community as well, and in that Kairn met us on our territory.  He honored our demands for discretion in that sense, so that was not part of the public presentation of draconity that his church gave to the area.  Would that I could say that was unnecessary, but humanity does have a great and arbitrary ability to hate sexuality, though all involved be centuries old and quite capable of handling their own consent (as it was in The Wheel).

I have had people desperately dependent on concealment try to force me into the darkness, and to fabricate the impression that I rely upon concealment.  Yet everything in my life *is* in my life, and I have not had trouble dealing with open challenge.  I have been lawful moreso than I was as Rakeela in my prior life, and I have not transgressed my nature in doing so.  So I have found that I can taunt some intensely dishonest people with a deeply false concern for integrity entirely by the power of throwing down the concealment upon my life, because I have found that the full breadth of my nature can stand within the aegis of the law.

Although the law barely cared to protect him at all and he lived in a society harsher and more dangerous than our own, Kairn very nearly found that he could do the same within *his* lifetime.  The dangers of openness are frequently overstated, and the people who make openness dangerous are not often those who are scrupulous.

We need to cast down authoritarianism in this society.  At this point, I have embraced Kairn's attitude in contravention of the shapeshifter ethos.  He *was* a shapeshifter, but for him that was as biology and not as destiny; he did not live as a shapeshifter, and used it for no power of concealment.  I recommend as Kairn recommended in a different world a glasswall solution as a source of deeper safety.  Those who conceal their observations of others cannot reliably be defied by driving them from positions of observation.  Far more total is the restraint placed upon them by forcing them and those they observe likewise into visibility.  In this retaliatory visibility is found the potential for restraint upon coercive falsehoods.

I would modify Kairn's attitude most distinctly in the area of sexuality.  I have not exactly been turned from antinatalism by the discovery that natalistic inquisitors are sexually dishonest people, yet antinatalism has never been antisexuality to me.  People who are honestly respecting each other's consent can have an awful lot of sex without reproducing.  Contemplating the converse, the example of the bonstable from the World Tree setting is brought to mind.  Bonstables always take charge of contraception and always ruin it; having done so, bonstables are very fecund and all their children are bonstables likewise.  Sexual ethics is developed in the capacity of deep mutual respect for consent, which is a quality trialed and forged by an open sexuality without accidents or manipulations.  Humanity needs to learn to stop looking to rights-violating rape cultures for its salvation from sexual evils.  Develop your sexual ethics, openly!
