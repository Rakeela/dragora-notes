I have a new desk!  It's gigantic.  I had to slide my keyboard and mouse over to be comfortably positioned for typing on my second monitor, which now feels way off to the side.  It's a standing desk which is strong enough to lean on, so Kistaro will stop worrying that I'm going to break the other one.

My environmental sciences class has an optional essay to fill in for one missed assignment.  It's on ending world hunger.  I think I'll do it.  I like essay assignments.  I skipped one discussion without excuse, so it'll fill in that slot.

I don't intend to plan out the essay here in *this* note, but...  World hunger is kind of one of those big hopeless topics.  What is the real problem?  People in backwards conservative societies have lots of unprotected sex, even when life is miserable and bringing children into it is direly unethical.  I am not being bigoted in favor of my own ancestors when I say that, as I would *greatly* prefer my peasant ancestors had been sterilized by ethical concerns.  No sapient should have to suffer the condition of being incarnate on Earth, even in today's era when we have improved so much beyond the imaginations of our ancestors.  It's unconsciable that people reproduced *in* the time of our ancestors.  They must have been completely insane.

Most people in most societies haven't generally seemed to think about ethics when children were involved, not for real.  They've always sort of made obligatory performances of thinking about the welfare of children, and quite often they've been "murderously sincere"... which is great, except actual sincerity doesn't have to kill people.  A lot of the people who've died to murderous conservatives were people who committed the crime of trying to elevate the actual ethics of their communities.

Only in the last few decades have people become sincere enough about the issue of child welfare to liberalize.  Those "sex-obsessed" and "degenerate" liberal societies where peoples' rights are respected... have under-replacement birth rates, low rates of sexual crimes, and *perfectionistic attitudes towards childrearing*.  "Helicopter" parenting was emotionally abusive, but it was still born of *perfectionistic* concern for children.  Much of the world isn't there yet.  They haven't done the "helicopter" thing (hopefully they'll skip it!), and they haven't accepted that societies don't develop emotionally healthy attitudes towards sex until they start opposing misinformation and sexual violence more than they praise parenting.

Liberal communities are looking for a perfectionistic attitude that actually works, but that's a different topic.  Moreover, it *has* to be a different topic.  Pointing out that most children in most of history were abused, despite the fact that parenting has been praised and honored in all or almost all prior societies, is wholly unacceptable thought.  It's a breathtaking taboo to acknowledge that humans on Earth don't appear to have begun improving at childcare until they *stopped* honoring parenting.  I'm doing my best to shift that status quo, but so far I can't make people care enough about child welfare to oppose natalism, and until *that* happens, humans are going to keep breeding to the famine line and going to war with their neighbors.  That's what I believe the real issue is.

I also think I'm personally powerless to do any reliable thing against that angle of the issue.  I *can't* make people care like that, and it seems like human intuition is violently wrong about this such that most of the time when people are induced to "care about children" they praise parenting *and then shut down the liberal societies that are capable of parenting*.  Sexual conservatives are vilely unwilling to care about child welfare sincerely enough to become sexual liberals.  Having said that I think makes it apparent that I'm not at all afraid to challenge taboos, but nevertheless, writing an essay about why I can't shut down natalism worldwide is less than appealing... for class.  I'll write it for my archive here, sure.

Fortunately, I do have another angle, which is that I'm interested in agricultural biotechnology.  There's nothing dishonest about focusing on that.  I can write about biofuels.  Agriculture is relatively unskilled work and good new crop strains can be distributed widely to increase productivity.  Better agricultural productivity means less famine and more wealth, thereby promoting technical and cultural advances in society.

I just wish I felt like curing world hunger today wasn't so much like trying to row a kayak up a waterfall.  We can restabilize at every population level *so far*, but that won't work forever, and the populations that reproduce most have the *least* wealth.  This is one thing that [[The-Viceroy]] reverses in an extraordinary way; it's not the wealthiest human societies that are hypernatalistic, but the human societies that are broken by poverty.  When the least wealthy populations split their wealth generationally, they get *less wealthy still*, which compounds the problem.

Why would any ethical sapience subject their children to that?
