I have a new desk!  It's gigantic.  I had to slide my keyboard and mouse over to be comfortably positioned for typing on my second monitor, which now feels way off to the side.  It's a standing desk which is strong enough to lean on, so Kistaro will stop worrying that I'm going to break the other one.

My environmental sciences class has an optional essay to fill in for one missed assignment.  It's on ending world hunger.  I think I'll do it.  I like essay assignments about trying to fix big global issues.  I skipped one discussion without excuse, so it'll fill in that slot.

I don't intend to plan out the essay here in *this* note, but...  World hunger is kind of one of those big hopeless topics.  What is the real problem?  People in backwards conservative societies have lots of unprotected sex, even when life is miserable and bringing children into it is direly unethical.  I am not being bigoted in favor of my own ancestors when I say that, as I would *greatly* prefer my peasant ancestors had been sterilized by ethical concerns.  No sapient should have to suffer the condition of being incarnate on Earth, even in today's era when we have improved so much beyond the imaginations of our ancestors.  It's unconsciable that people reproduced *in* the time of our ancestors.  They must have been completely insane.

Most people in most societies haven't generally seemed to think about ethics when children were involved, not for real.  They've always sort of made obligatory performances of thinking about the welfare of children, and quite often they've been "murderously sincere"... which is great, except actual sincerity doesn't have to kill people.  A lot of the people who've died to murderous conservatives were people who committed the crime of trying to elevate the actual ethics of their communities.

Only in the last few decades have people become sincere enough about the issue of child welfare to liberalize.  Those "sex-obsessed" and "degenerate" liberal societies where peoples' rights are respected... have under-replacement birth rates, low rates of sexual crimes, and *perfectionistic attitudes towards childrearing*.  "Helicopter" parenting was emotionally abusive, but it was still born of *perfectionistic* concern for children.  Much of the world isn't there yet.  They haven't done the "helicopter" thing (hopefully they'll skip it!), and they haven't accepted that societies don't develop emotionally healthy attitudes towards sex until they start opposing misinformation and sexual violence more than they praise parenting.

Liberal communities are looking for a perfectionistic attitude that actually works, but that's a different topic.  Moreover, it *has* to be a different topic.  Pointing out that most children in most of history were abused, despite the fact that parenting has been praised and honored in all or almost all prior societies, is wholly unacceptable thought.  It's a breathtaking taboo to acknowledge that humans on Earth don't appear to have begun improving at childcare until they *stopped* honoring parenting.  I'm doing my best to shift that status quo, but so far I can't make people care enough about child welfare to oppose natalism, and until *that* happens, humans are going to keep breeding to the famine line and going to war with their neighbors.  That's what I believe the real issue is.

I also think I'm personally powerless to do any reliable thing against that angle of the issue.  I *can't* make people care like that, and it seems like human intuition is violently wrong about this such that most of the time when people are induced to "care about children" they praise parenting *and then shut down the liberal societies that are capable of parenting*.  Sexual conservatives are vilely unwilling to care about child welfare sincerely enough to become sexual liberals.  Having said that I think makes it apparent that I'm not at all afraid to challenge taboos, but nevertheless, writing an essay about why I can't shut down natalism worldwide is less than appealing... for class.  I'll write it for my archive here, sure.

Fortunately, I do have another angle, which is that I'm interested in agricultural biotechnology.  There's nothing dishonest about focusing on that.  I can write about biofuels.  Agriculture is relatively unskilled work and good new crop strains can be distributed widely to increase productivity.  Better agricultural productivity means less famine and more wealth, thereby promoting technical and cultural advances in society.

I just wish I felt like curing world hunger today wasn't so much like trying to row a kayak up a waterfall.  We can restabilize at every population level *so far*, but that won't work forever, and the populations that reproduce most have the *least* wealth.  This is one thing that [[The-Viceroy]] reverses in an extraordinary way; it's not the wealthiest human societies that are hypernatalistic, but the human societies that are broken by poverty.  When the least wealthy populations split their wealth generationally, they get *less wealthy still*, which compounds the problem.

Why would any ethical sapience subject their children to that?

Bees are not friendly on the day that they're first met.  This is an aphoristic thought that occurred to me.

While trying to think my way around to biofuels, I ended up thinking about the inherent conflict between the emotional status of bees and the helpful services of the apiary industry.  The first response of many people to bees is dread.  The bee is a loudly buzzing, swiftly flying radiation of potential future pain, and yet somehow this is something that we benefit from in society.

I think this is because bees are comprehensible hazards.  There is a level of fear response to the bee which is rational, reliable, and not harmful of itself, which then is unusually favorable for a fear response.  The risk of the presence of bees is such as can be planned around.  This permits that risk to be traded off against the benefits of the presence of bees.

In the case of bees, this trade-off tends to be positive, as we can discern services that bees provide to the economy and the environment.  We can on that basis eventually discern the rational fear of the absence of bees, because we can find ways that having bees around can be protective.

All of that takes time and thought.  People don't like bees on their first encounter.

I wonder what a sci-fi strategy game would be like if it depicted an ecology of alien civilizations interacting with each other in obscure ways that make perfect sense to them in their own perspective, and leads to a chaotic interplay of which ones can engage productively where.  Is that too complex to build?

...biofuels.  I should be trying to trace a route to biofuels.  Or world hunger.  I think I know what's wrong; this is the essential tragedy stress again.  I'm thinking about how bad human society can get in an apparently stable way, with people living their entire lives in those conditions.  I feel like my attitude to how awful I think most of history has been is limiting my ability to think of solutions for the problems which face undeveloped nations.

Bringing it here to a personal log file might be more appropriate than working through it in the essays section...  or am I just failing at what I initially said I'd do, which was to not plan out the essay in this file?  I haven't found the way through my thoughts to what I intended to write the essay on as the "appropriate" subject, so I'm still "off-topic" right now.  I'm stuck striking glancing blows off of my horror at human misery.

I'm actually kind of scared of people who can arbitrage in that environment, and not in a way that doubts their compassion.  This is hurting my ability to think of building an organization capable of influencing global agriculture, which *is* at this point one of my central ambitions.  Being human just looks like it sucks so much, how can I *trade* on that?

...I didn't say a word about what I was working on, but the first thing Kistaro said to me after "Good morning," was to remind me to take my antidepressants.  Added to the log in the moment!

I can trade on human suffering, when and if trading on human suffering alleviates it.  Part of the appeal of biotechnological advances are their basic alleviation of suffering.  Health is the most shared common resource of all humanity at every level, which is sought for or given by many advances.  Furthermore, we are all subject to the laws of epidemiology and resource exhaustion, whose strictures I desire to relax through research, which research I've even hoped might make space travel easier through resolving deficiencies in mitochondrial metabolism in the biology of organisms in microgravity.  All good causes.

I want to live forever, but I want to leave this world.

This isn't a helpful source for my environmental sciences essay, but it's something I think I'll want to review later.  Over-expression of specific mRNA may impair glycolysis in the cells, leading to reduced muscle performance.

I wonder if it would be possible to treat microgravity muscle wasting by producing synthetic antibodies for over-expressed mRNA to cause them to be opsonized and reprocessed by neutrophils...  on the other hand, mRNA is already tiny, so maybe opsonization isn't the correct suppression mechanism.  Still, something may be possible here.  Treatments that increase metabolic performance in orbit would decrease the minimum required athleticism of astronauts.
