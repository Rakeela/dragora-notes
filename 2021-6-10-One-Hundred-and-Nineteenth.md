Lately I've been fantasizing about break room fixtures for a soda company, focusing on exotic beverages.  The idea would be to encourage employees to think creatively about beverages... and also to be fun.  Give the office a sense of uniqueness.

My first idea was a mystery machine.  Boasting dozens of flavors, it dispenses random drinks, with a shot-glass delivery mode and a full glass delivery mode.  I'd use the shot-glass delivery mode to trial it and make sure that I was only serving drinkables.  Likewise, the machine would identify which flavor it delivered by number, in case employees wanted to give feedback on specific flavors.  Diet sodas only, in any case.

My second idea was a hot flavored milk machine.  I've noticed that milk is a good carrier for lots of flavors.  I was thinking about how to use my supply of cacao butter, and I was wondering if I could melt some of it in heated milk.  Would it thicken the hot milk?  Which had me imagining it as a kind of ersatz milkshake... which was when I imagined a hot milkshake machine.  I don't think it would be a good idea to do, because I think the cacao butter would tend to congeal out too quickly, though I may experiment.  The basic idea of a hot flavored milk machine may be good, though.

"Black Rose Beverages" is what I'm thinking of calling the business.  I wish I knew someone who could make custom beverage-mixing machines, and I wonder if novel kinds of beverage machines could be a saleable product themselves.  In any case, if I actually found such a company, the intention behind it is to be a springboard by which to acquire funds with which to advance morphological freedom.
