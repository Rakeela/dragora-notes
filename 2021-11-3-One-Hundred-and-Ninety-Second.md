"The presences" have been bothering me about how my stomach is supposedly complaining about my aspartame soda consumption harming its microbiota, so I've gone to the store to buy a zero sugar kombucha.

...and I've walked out without paying for it, stealing it in a totally blase and inattentive manner.  So I'm going to go back to pay for it...

...as soon as I move the laundry over, something I often forget to do.  Thank you, psychosis, for these fulfilling and uplifting life experiences.
