Morning weigh-in:  248.4 pounds

I think I'm a little dehydrated.  My evening weigh-in is likely to record a higher weight today.  Still, compared to seven days ago (254.1 pounds), this is excellent week-on-week progress.

Maybe I wasn't just dehydrated.  I felt a little dry when I woke up, but my weight has continued to drop today despite good hydration.

I walked 5.1 miles, burning an estimated 903 kcal, taking 18,229 steps, and walking for four hours to the second.  My estimated speed was 1.2 mph.

I don't want to stop, but my right foot hurts.  Again.  It's always my right foot, lately.  The limit of my walking endurance is how long my right foot can take it.  Looking at my foot, there are two dry splits in the skin of my foot near my little toe.  That's what hurts.  Looking this up online, it appears these are called fissures.  They can be caused by diabetes, dehydration, or nutritional deficiency.  Treatment is with moisturizer and exfoliation of surrounding tissue.

I've rubbed some body wash into it.  I don't have proper moisturizer.  I'll go to the store and fetch some.  I don't want to exfoliate.  Maybe I don't need to.

I've eaten an atkins dessert bar and an atkins meal replacement bar today.  I also drank two energy drinks with ten calories each.  Total caloric load is 380 calories.  I consider this "fasting".  I don't fast religiously, so I'm not concerned about the difference between true fasting and fast-simulating.  Eating a small amount is less disturbing to people around me than eating nothing.  It's also safer.

I ate a few peanuts and a pickle, too.  I also drank a two espresso shots of heavy cream.
