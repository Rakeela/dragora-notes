#cannabis

I use cannabis.  It's pretty habit-forming.  Even though the effect would obviously be best if I used it twice a month, I tend to use it either daily or not at all.  The effect washes out, but the habit is reassuring.  I actually have 10-1 CBD cartridges that are barely psychoactive, because the habit is reassuring.  I don't get 'high' off of those, but I can still be puffing out vapor.

My basic excuse is that I have chronic pain, but I'm interested in the substance either way.  I'm interested in changing my state of mind (if I can do so without injury).  Things with a distinct psychoactive effect are interesting to me even if the effect is basically negative.  I like my mind; I want to move through its spaces.  This is something of a 'psychonaut' affinity, I think.  It's really about openness to experience, something towards which I seem to have been born with a strong inclination.

As a painkiller, cannabis is weird.  It doesn't really stop the sensation of pain the way opioids and OTC painkillers do.  It only makes pain ignorable.  Being in pain becomes less urgent and more like wondering about how a baseball team scored in its last match - if I don't have a specific reason to care urgently about that, it's trivia.  Pains that I can't do anything about, like chronic pains that rarely ever go away, become less like pains and more like trivias.

I'm prone to racing thoughts, and cannabis makes that 'worse', but I also kind of like my racing thoughts.  Lately I've discovered a treatment for racing thoughts, too.  If I want them to stop, I can chew on peppercorns.  The terpene caryophyllene seems to be a curative to racing thoughts and an anxiolytic.  I learned about this after puffing on a cartridge loaded with a strain that had an intense fraction of caryophyllene.  It tasted like black pepper and licorice, a weird flavor profile that stood out a great deal to me.  The strain was advertised as causing no paranoia.  I found it kind of slagged the rate of my thoughts, and was an unusually "empty-headed" high; my thoughts raced less than they race sober!  I looked up the flavor, and discovered that not only does caryophyllene contribute to the flavor of black pepper, but that chewing on peppercorns is already cannabis culture lore for dealing with racing thoughts.  Since discovering this, I've been wondering if black pepper should be used more in cooking, especially in times and places where people are recuperating from great stresses.

I was motivated to create and publish this file, because I wanted to add an entry to [[imagine-a-brain-implant]].  Chemical reservoirs are one of the big things that I think humans should be implanting into themselves.  Well, how about a caryophyllene reservoir?  It's not a superstimulus that I think would incline people towards wireheading, but if the trigger condition were correctly set, it's something that I think would be good for the mental health of someone who had one.  In a more mass market sense, they'd also be popular among cannabis users.
