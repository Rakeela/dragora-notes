The first day is the easiest.  My weight is still trending up as my digestion works through what I ate over the weekend.  I don't feel deprived of food yet.  If I only ate every other day, I might rarely feel deprived of food... but I tried that.  I ate too much when I could eat, and gained weight despite the days off.  I eat more on eating days than my body can store in glycogen.

Last time I tried intermittent fasting, I didn't exercise enough.  Exercise burns off stored glycogen.  If I'd done a lot of exercising while doing IF, I would've been better equipped to prevent the accumulation of excess glycogen (on eating days) and to get rid of it swiftly (on non-eating days).  Maybe I'll try IF again someday... when my weight is normalized.

I swear.  I felt sick this weekend.  I didn't feel good eating.  I ate the wrong things.  I kind of felt good about eating an Impossible burger with an egg on it Sunday evening, because that was good protein, but I ate a ton of handpies over the weekend, too.  Those are essentially not fit to eat.

I have eaten .44 pounds of fava bean salad.  It is one of my favorite things, and relatively low-guilt as I am sure it contains vital nutrients.  I am afraid my nutrient balance will fall short of what it needs to be as I diet hard.  Eating fava bean salad makes me feel much safer from dietary insufficiencies than eating pastries does.  Pastries are not nutritious, just fattening.

If the fava bean salad is still available at the store tomorrow, perhaps I'll buy more of it.

4,256 words on the file.  5,808 words on the file.  1,552 words of progress.  File complete.  Got struck immediately by depression on completing it, due to discrepancies between the two 'strands' of the storyline.  Different things are coming together at different rates.  I have to fix the discrepancy in the next chapter...  I think.  I either have to fix it or come up with a reason why it isn't an issue.

I feel hopeless.  Like I should just eat and accept being fat.  It's a dumb, unproductive feeling.

I've eaten a parm crisp.  Cheese is still "free".
