If there's anyone on Earth who thinks people are 'dead' when they'll never reproduce, they should consider me dead, as I will never reproduce.  I consider that attitude to be a solid example of rape culture, I'll note; anyone who regards reproduction as mandatory is a rapist waiting to happen.

I tried to buy an unusual soda variety to see if I could ration myself better now.  I did *slightly* better; it lasted a few days.  >.-.>

Sodas are still too hyperpalatable to be a safe caffeine dosage method for me.  Energy drinks are better; they're good, but not THAT good, and I don't find myself drawn to drinking too many of them.

I came up with the best way to describe my 5-2 fasting pattern.  It's the fastest rate at which I can celebrate successful fasts by eating large meals, and still reliably lose weight.  5-2 fasting provides the highest level of *feasting* which appears to be safe.  Indefinite feasting!
