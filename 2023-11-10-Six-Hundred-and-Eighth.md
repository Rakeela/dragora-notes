10:56.  Bit of a late start...  28,098.

12:20.  28,098.  I didn't really get started.

13:58.  29,052.  954 words of progress.  One more chapter should be quota.

14:11.  29,059.

16:30.  29,840.  1,742 words of progress.  I accidentally stopped the treadmill.  I meant to record how far I'd gotten, but frankly I'm a little drunk, and I closed the concluding readout rather than copying it.

19:50.  32,041.  3,943 words of progress.

23:34.  33,304.  5,206 words of progress.
