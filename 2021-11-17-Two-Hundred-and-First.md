I'm probably never going to bring back my old Traveller setting with Gridspace, but as I've thought of it today, I've thought I've an obligation to record it.  While I'm here...

Settings:
1) Kienth
2) Wasteland Engineering
3) Theoma
4) Gridspace

This is probably not comprehensive, but each of these may eventually become a link to a cluster elsewhere in this note vault.  In turn, they may become links out to other note vaults, as (for instance) Theoma already has a published vault.
