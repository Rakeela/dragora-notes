#Chives-of-Wrath

The world shall taste of the chives of my wrath!

---
The fantasy:  Chives modified through transgenic engineering of their DNA and mtDNA to become both extremely fast-growing and very hardy.  This easy to grow and highly edible weed will become a new staple allium crop, making the world's cuisine a little cheaper and a little more deliciously oniony.

The plan:  Through many steps of experimentation, I want to build a protocol to create chive cultivars that tolerate and propagate xenomitochondria within themselves.  Ultimately, I want to use chives as a model organism to test different *kinds* of xenomitochondria.  If there are plants with advantageous mitochondria, I want to get them into my chives and get my chives working with them, so that the chives will be the fastest growing in the world.  This will be the first product of [[Everloathing-Agritechnologies]], and the immediate foundation of its agritech research will be extending the protocol to other kinds of plants.

Experiment concept

~~I'm going to try to transplant temperature-tolerant pea seed mitochondria to chive seeds via cytoplasmic injection.  I will then stress the chives at temperatures within the temperature band of the pea seed mitochondria, but at which chives are barely viable.

~~Hypothesis:  Selection pressures internal to the cells will prefer the most temperature-tolerant mitochondria, leading to the successful replacement of most of the plant's mtDNA with donor mtDNA from the peas.

~~...I honestly expect my chives to either successfully expunge the pea mtDNA or else to propogate it and grow up as a sterile cultivar.  Peas may also not be the best donor source.  Maybe I should use a more tropical plant, like sugarcane.  First though, I have to get a grow rig set up, and I'd like to grow both peas and chives in my garage if possible.

I'm going to try to scrape superficial stem grafts from donor plants and apply them to matching scrapes on the stems of new chive sprouts.  Proving recombination should be as easy... and as hard... as proving the presence of mtDNA sequences in the experimental chives which are not in the control chives.

Hypothesis:  Mitochondria will move between the cells in the donor tissue and the cells of the chive sprouts, recombining with the mitochondria in the chive sprouts and spreading through the chive plants as they grow.

TBD:  Donor plant source, specific environmental stresses applied between control chives and experimental chives (if any).  I'm not going to worry about substoichiometric shifting just yet, but I'll put a note here for the future.

Grow rig planning

Materials needed:
- Hollow grow boxes with circular cutouts for inserting 
- Grow pots fit to the cutouts in the grow box
- Waterproof interior lining for grow boxes
- Water heater
- Water pump
- Water source
- Shelved cabinet for stacking grow boxes and limiting their air exchange

~I'm not sure how I'll manage irrigation in my garage.  This should involve a fairly large amount of water.  I want to control the growing temperature by controlling the temperature of the soil, and I want to do that by pumping temperature-controlled water through the grow boxes.

~I'm also bad at spatial planning, and I have to build my own grow rig.  I'm poking at FreeCAD and it's really a lesson in how little I know about constructing stuff.  Every piece of the design is a struggle.

I gave up making my own and decided to buy a premade solution.  I've bought a tower garden device and a grow tent.  Together, they'll provide an isolated, climate-controlled grow environment in which I will attempt to grow a first control population of chives.  If this works, I'll buy a second tower-tent combo in which to try the experiment proper.

The first aeroponic device I bought was poorly designed.  I've given it to my SO, who will (once I've disassembled it and returned it to its shipping crate) list it on Craigsworth.

A new aeroponic device has been ordered.  I'll start with a test grow to learn how to use it.  If the test grow goes well, the current plan is that I'll order two further aeroponic devices for actual experimental use.

My first round of chive seeds have been planted.  This is for my test grow to try to overcome my total inexperience at farming.  We'll see if the seedlings sprout; if they don't, we'll see if I can learn why they didn't.  I need a certain basic level of skill in order to produce the plant mitochondria research that is my eventual objective, and I don't think I've got it on native talent.

The new aeroponic device was set up without issue, I'll note.  I should've added that to my log before.

My chives have mostly sprouted.  I don't really know how to judge their growth.  I know to transplant them when they've outgrown their rockwool and can therefore gain sustenance from the aeroponics system.  I don't know how long that will take.  I don't know how deep chive roots even are.  Did I use the right amount of rock wool?  I'm self-conscious about my own ignorance.

My chives look kind of terrible.  I'm not sure what I've done wrong in tending them.  They're not dead yet, so I'll keep going, but I think botany classes may be an important part of my educational future.

I did my first four transplants to my aeroponics rig yesterday.  My chives have been doing much better lately; I discovered that I'd been underwatering them.  I've grown oddly attached to my smallest, weakest chive...  It is half an inch tall and I can't quite believe it will ever grow enough to flower, but it looked more dead two days ago than it does today.  It is still a living plant.
