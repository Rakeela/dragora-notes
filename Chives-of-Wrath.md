#Chives-of-Wrath

The world shall taste of the chives of my wrath!

---
The fantasy: Chives modified through transgenic engineering of their DNA and mtDNA to become both extremely fast-growing and very hardy.  This easy to grow and highly edible weed will become a new staple allium crop, making the world's cuisine a little cheaper and a little more deliciously oniony.

Grow rig planning

Materials needed:
- Hollow grow boxes with circular cutouts for inserting 
- Grow pots fit to the cutouts in the grow box
- Waterproof interior lining for grow boxes
- Water heater
- Water pump
- Water source
- Shelved cabinet for stacking grow boxes and limiting their air exchange

I'm not sure how I'll manage irrigation in my garage.  This should involve a fairly large amount of water.
