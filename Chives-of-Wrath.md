#Chives-of-Wrath

The world shall taste of the chives of my wrath!

The fantasy:  Chives modified through transgenic engineering of their DNA and mtDNA to become both extremely fast-growing and very hardy.  This easy to grow and highly edible weed will become a new staple allium crop, making the world's cuisine a little cheaper and a little more deliciously oniony.

The plan:  Through many steps of experimentation, I want to build a protocol to create chive cultivars that tolerate and propagate xenomitochondria within themselves.  Ultimately, I want to use chives as a model organism to test different *kinds* of xenomitochondria.  If there are plants with advantageous mitochondria, I want to get them into my chives and get my chives working with them, so that the chives will be the fastest growing in the world.  This will be the first product of [[Everloathing-Agritechnologies]], and the immediate foundation of its agritech research will be extending the protocol to other kinds of plants.

Experiment concept

I'm going to try to transplant temperature-tolerant pea seed mitochondria to chive seeds via cytoplasmic injection.  I will then stress the chives at temperatures within the temperature band of the pea seed mitochondria, but at which chives are barely viable.

Hypothesis:  Selection pressures internal to the cells will prefer the most temperature-tolerant mitochondria, leading to the successful replacement of most of the plant's mtDNA with donor mtDNA from the peas.

...I honestly expect my chives to either successfully expunge the pea mtDNA or else to propogate it and grow up as a sterile cultivar.  Peas may also not be the best donor source.  Maybe I should use a more tropical plant, like sugarcane.  First though, I have to get a grow rig set up, and I'd like to grow both peas and chives in my garage if possible.

Grow rig planning

Materials needed:
- Hollow grow boxes with circular cutouts for inserting 
- Grow pots fit to the cutouts in the grow box
- Waterproof interior lining for grow boxes
- Water heater
- Water pump
- Water source
- Shelved cabinet for stacking grow boxes and limiting their air exchange

I'm not sure how I'll manage irrigation in my garage.  This should involve a fairly large amount of water.

I'm also bad at spatial planning, and I have to build my own grow rig.  I want to control the growing temperature by controlling the temperature of the soil, and use stress-temperatures to modify the selection pressures on the plant's mitochondria, thereby favoring the mitochondria population that I give it.
