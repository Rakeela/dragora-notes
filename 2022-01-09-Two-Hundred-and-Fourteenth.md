Thinking about all the things that hardly ever happen on Theoma is morbidly depressing.  They are not Fated to do all manner of evil to each other, and Fate steers people gently away from many crimes.  It doesn't stop everything, but the *relative rates* are *so much lower* than on Earth, that I hate to think about what Earth is really like for so many people.

I don't want to work hard for this world.  There are too many 1-in-20 chances that ought to be 1-in-1000 or less, indeed that cannot be reduced enough, and too many 1-in-5 chances likewise.  I can't live with tragedy.
