8:15.  Last night's dream was unpleasant.  Too many bugs.

16:10.  Sleeping propped up has been something of a disaster.  My drive is gone.  My drive to work had been sputtering for a while, but since I started sleeping propped up, I've been thoroughly relaxed.  My stress levels have plummeted.  I'm not feeling like I need to get anything done.

17:20.  61,098.  Starting point was...  60,274.

19:03.  63,063.  I complained publicly about not being stressed enough.  Doing this was stressful, and helped me focus.
