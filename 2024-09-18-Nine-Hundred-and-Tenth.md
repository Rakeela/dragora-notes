9:02.  I'm almost ready to get to work.

10:29.  I forgot to mark my starting point.  40,459.  This is slightly trimmed from yesterday's, as editing a scene was the first thing I had to do this morning.

11:28.  40,634.  ARGH.  It's a pain.

12:42.  41,032.  This story is not working for me right now, and I am utterly fatigued.

12:45.  I am taking a break.  Technically, I laid down for a few minutes at the 12:42 mark, but I wasn't going to count that.  That was just a reaction to fatigue.

14:29.  41,406.  Did I actually take a break earlier?  I think I got distracted and forgot to do it.  But then I barely got anything done anyways, so what was the point?  Maybe a break would've been smarter than fading through an hour and a half.  I'm gonna go play The Ascent, but...  I don't know.  I'm stuck on the endgame and it's pretty dull.

14:47.  Ugh.  I don't want to play The Ascent anymore.

18:59.  43,787.  3,328 words of progress.

20:56.  44,197.  3,563 words of progress.

20:57.  You know what I'm not good at?  Satire.
