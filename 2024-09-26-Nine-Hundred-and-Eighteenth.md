10:53.  63,212.  63,246.

14:33.  I've been reading Stone and Paintings.  I'm at 74% on it.

17:11.  I pushed through on finishing the reread of Stone and Paintings, uploading new edits to Amazon for the epub and submitting it for paperback publication.  I did indeed find some errors, and I made some minor tweaks to the prose.

17:33.  I've hit a point in my writing where I can turn arbitrary concepts into books.

21:12.  63,346.  I didn't put in much writing today, but I did other stuff.  Maybe not enough other stuff.  Maybe, though.  I did get Stone and Paintings published.
