14.3 Oxidation and Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones

In Toliens' test, a "silver mirror" forms when the oxidation of an aldehyde reduces silver ions to metallic silver.  The silvery surface of a mirror is formed in a similar way.  (Commentary:  Silver mirrors are rare, so this doesn't mean that mirrors are silver.  Does this instead mean that mirrors are formed by chemical deposition of metals?)

Aldehydes oxidize readily to form carboxylic acids.  (The esxample is given of ethanal oxidizing to ethanoic acid.)

Toliens' test may be used to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones because it oxidizes aldehydes but not ketones.  It utilizes Toliens' reagent, which is a solution of Ag+ (silver cation) and ammonia.  As the aldehyde is oxidized, Ag+ is reduced and forms a layer called a silver mirror on the inside of the container.

Benedict's test gives a positive result with compounds that have an aldehyde functional group with an adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) group.  It utilizes Benedict's solution, which contains Cu^2+ (CuSO4).  When the solution is added to this type of aldhyde and heated, a brick red solid of Cu2O forms.  (Commentary:  Cu^2+ is the cupric ion, which carries a double charge.  Cu^2+ notation distinguishes it from Cu2+, which would be a pair of copper atoms bonded together and still carrying a positive charge.  I don't think Cu2+ is possible, but I'm clarifying a new notation for my notes.)

Because sugars such as glucose contain this type of aldehyde grouping, Benedict's reagent can be used to determine the presence of glucose in blood or urine.

(Commentary:  The teacher has OIL RIG written on the whiteboard for some reason, and I'm perplexed by it.)

Aldehydes and ketones are reduced by hydrogen (H2) or sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and a catalyst such as nickel, platinum, or palladium.  They are reduced to alcohols by decreasing the number of carbon-oxygen bonds (and increasing the C-H bonds).  (Commentary:  Addition increases oxygen bonds.  Reduction reduces oxygen bonds.  If I understand correctly.)

Aldehydes are reduced to primary alcohols.  (The example is given of propanal aka propionaldehyde being reduced to 1-propanol aka propyl alcohol.)

14.4 Hemiacetals and acetals

Maltose, a disaccharide, is produced from the hydrolysis of of the starches in grains, such as barley.  In maltose, an acetal bond links two glucose molecules.  (Commentary:  I do not need this slide.)
