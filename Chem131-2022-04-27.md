14.3 Oxidation and Reduction of Aldehydes and Ketones

In Toliens' test, a "silver mirror" forms when the oxidation of an aldehyde reduces silver ions to metallic silver.  The silvery surface of a mirror is formed in a similar way.  (Commentary:  Silver mirrors are rare, so this doesn't mean that mirrors are silver.  Does this instead mean that mirrors are formed by chemical deposition of metals?)

Aldehydes oxidize readily to form carboxylic acids.  (The esxample is given of ethanal oxidizing to ethanoic acid.)

Toliens' test may be used to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones because it oxidizes aldehydes but not ketones.  It utilizes Toliens' reagent, which is a solution of AG+ (silver cation) and ammonia.  As the aldehyde is oxidized, AG+ is reduced and forms a layer called a silver mirror on the inside of the container.
