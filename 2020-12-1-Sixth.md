I've been studying [[mitochondria]] again today.  I'm finding out more of what's already been done.  Less of what I'm interested in looks truly novel, but the research taking down its novelty is largely still recent enough that I'd feel like replicating basic experiments was a useful contribution.  Yeast without mtDNA are used for mitochondrial research already.  The capacity of yeast to replicate mitochondria other than its native mitochondria is already proven.  So far, it looks like the novelty of my desired experimentation is limited to instrumentalizing the replacement of mitochondria for biofabrication purpposes.  Ie, I'm trying to mechanize the process more.  I haven't turned up evidence that anyone else has tried this yet, but as of yesterday I hadn't turned up evidence that mitochondria could survive without mitochondrial DNA.  Who knows what I'll find as I keep searching for information?

I've found at the least that there's standard equipment for some of the experiments I'd like to perform.  The prices for the machines are listed as "inquire", and the prices for the peripherals are listed in the thousands of dollars.  It looks a bit cost-prohibitive for me, personally.  It inspired a brief fantasy of a medical research supply company existing as a charitable endeavor.  Specializing in cost-cutting, rather than innovation, the engineers employed by this fantasy non-profit work to replicate the capabilities of expensive current machinery at lower price points.  I've no way to judge if the fantasy is a reasonable one.  How fast do the technical requirements of research machinery change?

It's not necessarily an exclusively charitable fantasy.  If more of the biofabrication processes were productively mechanized into the recurrent economy, some of the research machinery might start facing industrial cost reduction pressures due to a proliferating deployment of stably-defined technical equipment.  As more of the involved economy became looped with regular processes and predictable machine wear, less innovative structures could contribute.  It's quite a thought!  I love thinking about industry.  Yet I'm not seriously considering myself potentially capable of starting a biofabrication heavy industry corporation...  My current ambition only tops out at formalizing a scalable mitochondrial production process using existing bioreactor technologies, and I'm still a long way from achieving that.

I'm still planning to keep taking business courses at college.  Business and science.
