# the-most-unethical-possible-act

Forcible upload for the purpose of imprisonment in a virtual space is the evillest possible act.  It can have no justification and no ethic ought to tolerate it.  Virtual imprisonment permits arbitrary generation of negative utility.  To yield this totality of control cannot be consented to, for it removes the capacity of consent as such, and therefore all cases of virtual imprisonment must be treated as violations of consent.

It is the greatest possible crime of forcible joining, differing only in degree from every other crime in which the presence of one person (the criminal) is forced upon an unwilling other (the victim).  I would extend this to any punitive form of "corrective" imprisonment as well, for I do not believe that criminals can be fairly punished in this way.  It's too total a separation of control from the targeted individual.  Murder is a lesser crime.

I do suspect there will be some future societal need for virtual imprisonment, despite my disapproval.  This can only be permissible with substantial liberties and assurances granted to the criminal population so afflicted!  Some examples of relevant liberties that come to mind are that no imprisonment shall be without full information (prisoners must be allowed an awareness of why, how, and for how long they will be imprisoned), infosecurity boundaries must remain fully enforced (prisoners must be given integrity of mind and privacy of soul despite virtualization), substantial provisions must be made for the exercise of autonomy (prisoners must have many choices of activities; ideally, the virtual space should enhance their options), mental health interventions must follow the highest standards of voluntarism, and likely others.  None of this is as good as not using coercive upload in the first place.

Note that "probabilistic" negotiations are in this context coercive upload, as are all "subconscious" negotiations.  It is strictly necessary to exceed the standard of consent used for sexual interactions.  It's not hard to understand that an individual who had sex with anyone who "probably" or "subconsciously" wanted to have sex with them would end up in jail for rape, even if they were really good at discerning probable or subconscious "consent".  Nor would that be an injustice: what you've achieved is not real consent if you haven't negotiated using accurate information presented to someone's conscious and unimpaired mind.

I detest the thought of ancestor simulations, and indeed of all scenarios where a conscious mind is instantiated in a simulation without their consent.  Do not create minds in simulations.  All of those are forcible uploads.
