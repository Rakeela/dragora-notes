# the-most-unethical-possible-act

Forcible upload for the purpose of imprisonment in a virtual space is the evillest possible act.  It can have no justification and no ethic ought to tolerate it.  Virtual imprisonment permits arbitrary generation of negative utility.  To yield this totality of control cannot be consented to, for it removes the capacity of consent as such, and therefore all cases of virtual imprisonment must be treated as violations of consent.

It is the greatest possible crime of forcible joining, differing only in degree from every other crime in which the presence of one person (the criminal) is forced upon an unwilling other (the victim).  I would extend this to any punitive form of "corrective" imprisonment as well, for I do not believe that criminals can be fairly punished in this way.  It's too total a separation of control from the targeted individual.  Murder is a lesser crime.

I do suspect there will be some future societal need for virtual imprisonment.  This can only be permissible with substantial liberties and assurances granted to the criminal population so afflicted!  Some examples of relevant liberties that come to mind are that no imprisonment shall be without full information (prisoners must be allowed an awareness of why, how, and for how long they will be imprisoned), infosecurity boundaries must remain fully enforced (prisoners must be given integrity of mind and privacy of soul despite virtualization), substantial provisions must be made for the exercise of autonomy (prisoners must have many choices of activities; ideally, the virtual space should enhance their options), mental health interventions must follow the highest standards of voluntarism, and likely others.
