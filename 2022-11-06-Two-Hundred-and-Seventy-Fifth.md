File is at 1,037 words, and ugh...  I don't want to work on writing today...  It's so hard to get going today...  My body hurts a little and my feelings hurt a lot.

A previous file is at 2,588 and I want to add something to it...  Now it's at 2,602 for a difference of 14 words.  Yay.

1,715 words.  That's 678 words of progress (on this file) and 975 words to go (in all).

2,074 words.  That's 1,037 words of progress on this file, and 616 words to go.

2,225 words.  1,188 words of progress, and 465 words to go.

2,405 words.  1,368 words of progress.  285 words to go.

2,892 words.  1,855 words of progress.  -202 words to go.  Finally.

I have nothing to talk about lately but Nanowrimo.  The blog posts don't fully convey my frustration.
