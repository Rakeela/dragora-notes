I ate an oil, cheese, and olives thing this morning.  It was tasty enough while I was eating it, but now that I've finished it, I regret my choice.  The aftertaste.  The burps.  They're foul.  The olives were great, but the cheese was not.  Cheese is gross.  It's upsetting because it's such a healthy food.

I caved and ate a pair of (vegan hemp) taquitos.  Hopefully that will suppress or at least reflavor the gaseous aftermath of the cheese I started with.  Oop.  There was the first post-taquito burp.  Hm.  Not too bad.  Sigh.  This is going to drive me spare though, I can tell.  Today may break my fast.

And yes I know, "You've already broken it, you ate," but I'm just dieting harshly.

There.  I bought diet ginger ale.  Hopefully that helps with the cheese burps.  I also bought some sugar cookies on clearance.  They'll be stale for sure by the time I eat them, but that's okay.  Sugar cookies don't really go stale, do they?

I tried to do other non-writing stuff, and I wasted an hour and a half somehow, but I spent that hour and a half pretty thoroughly bored.

I read a bit farther into this Silk Road book that I've got.  That was almost interesting.  It's still kinda depressing.  So much beautiful art, but also so much fighting.  People killing each other for stupid reasons.  Pogroms.  Bans against religions.  Rebels who destroy the communities they're trying to change.

America generally admires ambition, but America generally has the privilege of great pacifism.  Ambition can be very productive in dedicated pacifists.  It's very destructive in people who are willing to hurt others to get their way.

I took a nice bike ride across town and worshipped the sweets available at a grocery store on the other side of Redmond.  I didn't buy anything this time; I'm stocked!  I just wandered around enjoying the fact that sweet foods are so highly available.  They were everywhere.  Grocery stores are a little like paradise.

I almost bought some mustard BBQ beans.  Those are also a delicious, sweet food.  I can't eat them right now though.  I can go there whenever; I should save it for some other time.

6:40, or I suppose 18:40, since in theory I should be using 24-hour time.  This is the first time all day that I feel like I don't need food.  I just spent a while thoroughly distracted by reading a story on Royal Road, and I came away from it feeling not-hungry.

My artifice in The Tachanigh-Kelkaith is so inferior.  The description of the paintings on the pots!  Did I choose good concepts?  How will I ever know?  I have contacted an artist to arrange the creation of an advertisement and I have mentioned the possibility of drawing several of the pots for it.  Perhaps that will tell me if the pots as described are a good idea.

If they are not, it is surely too late to change it.

I planned to eat more cheese today, and I'm having a hard time getting myself to do it.  My sense of hunger finally faded.  Now I'm supposed to eat... of all things... cheese?  It'd be cheese and mayonaisse, but it's still a bit yikes.

I'm going to do it anyways.  I prize keeping to my plans... or I should.  I kinda don't, but I should.  Most importantly, cheese and mayonaisse is keto-kosher.  It shouldn't kick me out of fat-burning.  These cheese-and-mayo things are reaching their sell-by date, too.

One thing I think I'm going to skip is my weekday dose of tequila.  God, it feels weird to have bought tequila for a staid and regularized plan.  I think I like it, though.  The flavor is pretty good.

Oh my goodness, I have to save this!  I just looked up "What does tequila taste like?" and it turns out someone on Quora responded with this:  "Lemongrass, honey, white pepper, chamomile flowers on a frost coated dawn, grasping scents tickle your nose as burnt red clay dirt rises to the sky. Exhaust from a pickup truck intrudes as a white truck passes by. The day will be long."  Thank you, Chad Owen.  That's poetry.  I feel like I should write a character who gets deep into their sensations like that.  I want to read a book written like that.

I can't write like that.  What does tequila taste like to me?  "Pretty good."  If I try a little harder... Maybe I could call it spiky.  It's got something up front that stings a little in a way that isn't quite the same as alcohol.  There really is a touch of fruitiness to it.  A lot of the answers to the question say that, and when I think about it, I can agree.
