Starting off the day with a handpie.

I walked until my legs grew tired yesterday, and even though I'm not sore today, I'm still finding it hard to keep walking.  It's nearly 1 PM and I haven't broken two hours on the treadmill yet.

I feel totally unmotivated today.  I just hate this world.  I want to drink and feast, not exercise and fast.  Even that wouldn't make me feel good.  I don't want to work on my writing.

I've just kept walking.  I've been reading TvTropes.  This is a depressive activity, not an inspiring or happy one, even when I'm reading about stuff that I love.  It's not that bad though.  I'm re-experiencing [[Phantasy-Star-4]].  As one of my all-time favorite titles, it really should have a place on my list of [[Notable-Videogames]].

It would take me away from my walking for hours, but I kinda want to try playing Galciv 4.  I just learned about it recently.  It's only on Epic Games, which is unfortunate.  If it was on Steam, I'd load it up for remote play.  Getting remote play working on an Epic Games title requires more tech savvy.  There are tutorials for doing it, but I'm shy of implementing one.  I should just do it...

I tried Iratus, Lord of the Dead not too long ago.  It's very much supposed to be an evil protagonist, but at the same time I got the impression that Iratus is rising on a wildly corrupt world.  Evil vs evil seems to be a cliche for villain protagonist games.

I am totally finding it difficult to keep walking today.  I'm 3 hours in and I am just continually wanting to stop and give up.  Can I really keep doing this for four hours today?  I keep searching for excuses to stop.  Although one occurs to me that I probably should stop for, which is to moisturize my right foot.  It still has fissures on it.  Now there's a problem that would go away if I were a virtual entity!

I wonder how long the fissures will take to go away.  They stopped hurting once I started moisturizing them, but now I'm waiting for new skin to grow underneath them, aren't I?  The damaged exterior has to grow out and be sloughed off.

In theory, my strategy for walking at my computer is to have some kind of distraction going all day.  Ideally, this is supposed to be my work, but wow I can't shake my antipathy to writing right now.  Today is a day off for reasons of poor mental health.  I'm not going to dignify this by calling it a "self-care day", I'm just not doing well right now.  I can't work like this.

I have books.  I consider reading books marginally more productive than repetitively checking websites that haven't changed since last time I checked them.  It's more like studying writing than filling in my day-log on a bad day.  By the way, a thought.  Long day-logs speak of suffering.  Happiness has brevity.  Misery has breath.

I'm five miles into my walk.  I want to stop.  I want to eat.  I want to walk eleven miles today.  I want to play Galciv 4.  I want to go outside with my Freewrite and review what I've already written to see what I need to write next.  I'll do that one.

I took my Freewrite out for a walk, but I didn't use it.  I just went to the store and bought a falafel wrap.  At 390 calories, it's enough food for an entire day.  Calories-in/calories-out is such garbage.  Weight loss is actually a hormone management game.  I have to spend as much time in a low insulin state as possible.  Eating one small meal every day means I spend most of my day burning stored energy.

Now I'm going to go set up Galciv 4 and try it.

Aaand...  installing.  I'm back to walking a little longer.  I'm five and a half miles into my walk for the day.  I'm going to play No More Future until I get to six miles, then I'll check on the status of the install and get started on the game if it's ready.  And... There.  Mile six.  Huh.  Installation at 73%.  Guess I'll keep going.  The majority of the installation was done in half a mile.  If I give it, maybe .4 of a mile this time, it should be ready.  There.  6.4 miles in.  Let's check again.
