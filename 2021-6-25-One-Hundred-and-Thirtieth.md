Contract negotiation involves a lot of good faith endeavor to find something satisfactory to both sides in order to achieve ideal results, doesn't it?  I'm thinking about how... *relatively* unexploitative the dragons of my world were.  Trying to negotiate contracts with humans not only *would* be kind of traumatic, it *was* kind of traumatic; we admired, influenced, and tried to utilize human society, but we also had a lot of hard edges and fears in our personalities as a result of dealing with a society that did *not* have social contract negotiation as a common form of recreation from an early age.

Humans mock, degrade, abuse, and distort the agreements that bind them, and they even consider such behavior "playful" at times.  They're being "creative".  Creative contract interpretation results in totally adversarial contract negotiations.  Humans have fun at the expense of others, and then have to live in a world where they are constantly being harmed by each other.

That societal discrepancy between the human attitude to contracts and the dragon attitude to contracts contributed to a substantial hatred of humans on the part of the dragon population.  We played honest games, trying to work together.  Violating the spirit of negotiations was *completely unfun*.  We weren't stiff to each other, but humans stiffened everything with their hatreds.  Contracts have to get stiff and skeptical and hostile to deal with "creative" contract interpretation... and so when we interacted with humans, we were obliged to be stiff, skeptical, and hostile.  The human insistence on nonconsensual fluctuation results in a stiffer society that moves less fluidly.

The contrast with when we interacted with each other could not be more stark.  In playing Contract with each other, our objectives flowed as we moved through many speculative potentials to try to find a more profitable way of being.  Our voluntary mutual adherence to the contracts opened up a world of flexibility.  And we loved each other!  Most of us loved each other, most of the time.

Sometimes, the harder humans try to force flexibility, the less flexibility they have.  Love becomes a lie when humans get bored and force stagnation into things with incompetent mercurialism that amounts to one-sided authoritarianism.
