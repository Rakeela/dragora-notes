Unpublished first draft:

An Essay Written to Express Hopelessness and the Fear of Corruption in Necessary Endeavors

For sheer memorability, the most resonant climate change news story I ever read was about the pandemic quarantines leading to clear-air days in cities beset by extreme pollution.  That's arguably just weather, but I think it speaks to the degree to which humanity has been helpless to deal with the pollution that our technologies create.  A virus kept everyone out of their cars for a while, and the air became more breathable.  It seems that no force of any society on Earth can exert the amount of force that a virus can exert.

This is part of the broader problem with environmentalism.  We're obligated to dislike cars, but we can't stop people from driving.  We don't even want to stop car manufacturers from developing really cool technologies, but sometimes they make solving big problems harder when they do.  We can't make cars suck so that other people dislike them as well, and we don't want to.  We don't want to make life suck, and hardline environmentalism would tend to.  Environmentalism is popular in small doses and appalling in extremes.  Yet we need fairly extreme actions to prevent the global climate from going to horribly destructive places, and the balance between the two tensions hasn't been found.

If the media tries to present the kind of eco-industrialist response that I think is necessary for a project that amounts to rebuilding the world economy, they're accused of greenwashing polluting industry.  What is worse, that complaint is fair; actual polluting industries are more than happy to invest in greenwashing themselves!  It takes pressure off of them more than it represents them taking the problem seriously.  I don't know how to solve this.  I wish we could send the industrialists who want to reshape the whole surface of the Earth over to Mars to make that the planetary ecumenopolis that they dream of.  I would go with them!  Earth can't handle that level of development, but treating Mars that way would actually tend to improve its environment.  Hyper-industrialists are ironically the people who could make Mars start sprouting forests even though on Earth they're people who are dragging down our future.

I don't know what the media can do about this.  There's a lot of very sophisticated, nuanced people behind the production of the news, but that hardly matters.  Anything that relies on influencing public opinion is necessarily a blunt instrument.  People sympathize with charismatic megafauna, but does that sympathy translate to subsidies for vertical farming and artificial meat research that would densify agriculture, enabling more of the wilderness to be restored?  People hate coughing on choking smog, but that opinion doesn't provide municipalities with the resources for expensive redevelopment to reduce car-dependency, nor does it reduce economic dependencies on polluting employers.  It's like we need to rebuild our cities and somehow we need to rebuild them while using fewer industrial resources.  How is that possible?  The problem goes beyond perceptions.

It runs aground on one more shoal as well.  I mentioned vertical farming and artificial meat research.  I think that conjunction would be highly competent environmental policy, but I'm aware that what I'm really expressing might just be a form of my own corruption.  I'm interested in compact high-yield agricultural production environments.  I'm also interested in artificial meat and other forms of industrial cell-culturing.  I want to try to push agricultural science forward whether or not society supports me in that, but when speaking about what I wish 'the media' were doing, I'm aware of myself as someone with a conflict of interest.  Should I ask the media to popularize a subject that may someday enrich me?  Is it ethical for me to promote the development of subsidy programs, knowing that I long to spend the next few years in education developing the skills I would need to claim those subsidies myself?

Worst of all, I have to return to eco-industrialism.  I think that the problem of environmentalism requires a lot of industrial commitment to solve.  What we need is no less than societal reconstruction.  Yet environmentalism and industrialism partnered together... that's just greenwashing.  It's something corrupt.  I don't know how to make the same thing happen "except honestly".  Vast amounts of resources need to come together in good order, and great swathes of those resources seem to be held by dishonest people.  How could the media do anything about that?

Reflections on the draft:
My original thought while starting on this was, "I've almost never noticed any particular news story about climate change.  I tend to pay attention to the issue only in an ambient way, certain only that I can't impact it in the short-term by following the news on it.  How can I write an essay about the media?"
I then realized that the problem of how to direct the media is fundamentally hard.  How could I make an essay out of "I don't know the answer to the question that has been proposed for discussion?"  Well, the answer there is kind of "at impressive length," isn't it?  It's a bit longer than what the other students have put together.
It doesn't really satisfy me for quality, either.  The pandemic's effects on air quality were not that salutary on review.  Glancing briefly at the struggles to interpret the data, I'm left with a feeling that industrialization proceeded faster than science could keep up with.
"I don't know" is a pretty disappointing take, and hopelessness is not great either.  I may want to refine this.  I kinda just don't see it as a media issue?  We don't expect the media to lead the way on material sciences, so why do we expect the media to lead the way on climate change?  "It's political" isn't enough of an answer, because agricultural policy is political, yet we don't look to the media as a source of pressure to change it.  Although arguably I did just that in the essay above...  There's a whole lot "I don't know" here.

Whenever the page scrolls vertically or horizontally, the scrollbars flicker into existence.  Every so often that happens with nothing happening, and having already demonstrated to my satisfaction that the stalkertrash authoritarian hacker set watch me write these, I wonder if those are data exfiltration events.  I can readily imagine them as little moments where someone with a script-accelerated perspective scrolls the page faster than I can observe it scrolling in order to look above the current limit of what's on my screen.  I don't think that's what's really going on (I've noticed that the scrollbars flicker whenever the text substantially reflows or a new line starts), but it's a reminder of something that I think is a deeply fundamental injury to the harmony of many societies.
I wish we had a less authoritarian society.  I think that's the basic thing which environmentalism REALLY needs, though I can't say it in a college class; if society's trust basis were more rational and less exploited, we'd believe people when they talk about difficult adjustment periods and necessary privations.  We still have a society that weaponizes trust and abuses people if they try to defend anyone against hostile exploitation.  Why is it then surprising that people don't want to adjust their whole lives to suit the whims of someone who may only be expressing vapid hatred?  Yet still, the media is not the tool of repair in that case, either...  That one goes to the judiciary, and depending on the unknown true extent of the problem may even require an appetite for prosecuting corrupted people in media.

Reflections, take two:
Saying the first thing that occurs to me isn't necessary for honesty's sake, and in this case the specific form of honesty that should matter most is academic integrity.  I could create a very honest essay by looking up what others have already written about the relationship between the media and environmentalism.  I'm certain no shortage of ink has been spilled on the subject.  This could enable authoring a second draft with a different attitude on the media and less specific reliance on my personal interests.
...
...Well, I looked up one thing and then had a wildcat idea which completely sabotages the idea of looking up something with less specific reliance on my personal interests.  This article that I looked up (link at bottom of paragraph) talks about the reliance on metal of media technologies.  So I had an odd idea at that point.  Is there any sense in which society is underutilizing wood?  Relatedly, can we replace more of our metal with the products of agriculture?  I'm not talking about cooking on a grape stove; I'm thinking about agriculturally-sourced plastics.

I could try writing an essay purporting to demonstrate, with citations, that modern industry is underutilizing some kind of unusually eco-friendly plastic.  But wait, that has no connection to the media.  I could do it by crediting this blog as a media source itself, but I'm unsure about doing that.  Should I hold the media accountable for not promoting material science transition as much as possible?  It seems like an unfriendly thing to imagine.  I'm not exactly proposing to back their budget sheets if getting circulation up for boring industrial media turns out to be one Herculean task too far for the limits of consumer interest.
Manipulation of the media can only occur within various realms of possible public interest.  When we say the media has a responsibility to do better about something, the statement itself is a manipulation of media, which people would hardly bother saying if they didn't think that such senses of responsibility are a valid control lever operating in society.  Keeping it in mind for the moment as a manipulation of media, it still can only manipulate media within the limits of consumer interest.  Arbitrarily responsible media professionals might have no greater ability to shift the public than what they have demonstrated already.  Any demand made of the media must fall within the 'various realms of possible public interest' or the response might well be helpless sympathy.
Should I draft an essay about /that/ as a topic?  Yet drafting that in this context is like rebuking environmentalism for expecting too much of the media.  I can see where I got to it from my earlier position of uncertainty, too.  It's a restatement of the position that I don't know what the media could do.
Everyone wants the environment fixed, but they shun the idea of reindustrializing enough to produce the materials needed to fix the environment.  Can I write an essay about that for the class?  I kind of already did.  That's the greenwashing issue.  Industrialists have to be more sincere than they actually are about this issue for the media to help with this.
Solving society is difficult.

Reflections, take three:
Is it possible to demonstrate that more could be done to accelerate the adoption of best practices?  I'm thinking here of how much of a gap there often is between healthcare's ideal and healthcare as actually practiced.  I'm thinking about government nutrition standards and how far they've fallen from the best nutrition information available to medicine.  Is there any similar deficiency between environmentalism as scientists understand it and environmentalism as the business world understands it?  Science is always as accurate as possible.  While mirroring laboratory conditions across the whole economy is neither desirable nor possible, failing to build strong bridges between the economy and science is just ineffectual policy.
Yet proving the existence of such a gap in a domain where I do not know it exists, but have merely conjectured its existence as would be convenient for my present activity, is a little bit difficult to even start on.  Humbugging about "more should be done!" with negligent explanation would be a fine bloviation, but it's not intellectually ideal...  I can well imagine writing three paragraphs about how I think the media should do more to promote best practices without needing the slightest idea of what I'm talking about, and while I wouldn't consider it shameful, I'd like to do better.
I think I'll just write that essay if writing a better one proves a task that's going to take more than a day.
This question of best practices feels like a painful optimization challenge.  Best practices by what measure?  Where is the economy in recycling?  The business world is already full of people who are very easily persuaded by accounting.  I feel like it's a fundamental expensiveness issue.  I think most people would stop at that point, but fundamental expensiveness to me sounds like "this issue that requires the invention of new materials and material processes to be feasible".  I bet asteroid mining would help.  Off-world resources could shift many fundamental expensiveness equations.
"The media should help the environment by portraying space travel more positively!" sounds like a worse essay than strong vagueries about doing more for best practices.  At best, it's a little TOO ground-breaking.  It sounds like a topic that would take writing a book to fairly prove.  I think I'm more likely to someday read that book than write it myself.
I really think I need to read more of the essays that the other students will write.  It's a discussion board; if I'm stymied for my contribution, maybe that's just a sign of how interested I am in the discussion itself.  So far, only one of the other student essays has been posted so far.  It's a lament that climate change isn't covered more.  I think it's got about as much content as my fallback essay saying that the media should promote environmental best practices more.  I don't feel like it's actually true that the media hasn't covered climate change during the pandemic.  It's hard to tell where biases about the media have ended enough to call a thought information about the media, but be it bias or information, I tend to think the media is very friendly to environmentalism.
Which suggests hope for the "what could the media do better" question.  If the media is trying all they can, that might mean they can't do more, or it could mean that they can't tell which lens provides the most effective way to view the issue.  I've been thinking about the gearworks of the economy here, and fretting that I couldn't say anything to the media that would be straightforwardly popular... er, I still am.  Don't ask me what kind of nature documentary would sell best to the public.  I'm sure I don't know.
Well, what about a call for expertise?  Is there some specialty that could be strengthened in media to provide a clearer lens to the public?  I...  I'm sure I don't know.  Very reluctantly.  This whole question is bothering me.  If I want people to think better about environmental causes, which I very much do, I wouldn't want the media to make it better for me.  I would want to improve people's opinions myself with relevant discoveries, and I would want to support people doing the same.  I think of the underlying 'true' popularity of environmentalism as coming up from its roots in causality.
I mean, I know why I care about the environment seventy years from now.  As an immortalist, I expect to have to live in that weather, every day.  If I manage to move to Mars or the asteroid belt by then, that only means someone else has to live in that weather.  I don't expect to die ahead of those bad consequences; if I'm not sharing a world with those who are stuck in them, I'll still be sharing ethical responsibilities with those who are.

Can I make an essay titled, "I'm not qualified to direct the media"?

New Concept:  Geo-engineering.  I'll have to dig for a 2020 news article about geo-engineering and say that's what caught my attention most, but that shouldn't be too hard.  I can use the essay to ask about the local weather implications of oceanic mirror fleets, and whether attempting to use them to bias regional weather systems in economically productive ways has been attempted.

This also covers one of my two necessary citations for the essay.  For the other one, I need a better, more research-oriented source.  Something about microclimates which would be suggestive of possible future research.  I wonder if I can really excite the professor.
It's proving kind of difficult to find relevant data on microclimates.  I'm getting the impression that more studies have been done on urban albedo's influence on microclimate than rural or (especially) wilderness albedo's influence on microclimate.  Have studies not tracked the implications of albedo?  That's kind of surprising in an era with environmental observation satellites overhead.
Thought debris: if buildings could change color, they could be programmed to retune their solar absorption profile according to HVAC requirements.
Microclimate may also be the wrong word.  I'm looking for something on the scale of an airshed.

This talks about how increasing albedo lowers rainfall.  It should give me enough to talk about, though no firm conclusion.  It's not ideal, because it doesn't give me much insight into how the nautical side of this would influence rainfall.  On the other hand, it may be excellent for setting up the question and, in essence, proposing the experiment.  A mirror-fleet of sufficient size should be capable of creating observable fluctuations in precipitation patterns, and the sufficient size in question (to create an experimentally observable event) falls well short of the amount of investment likely to stress the global economy and/or existing compensatory mechanisms in climate.
It does talk a little bit about cloud condensation nuclei in the maritime environment.  I'm having a little trouble parsing that and trying to infer its implications.  This source claims that condensation nuclei are abundant over the continents, but scarce over the ocean.  That makes me wonder if some kind of oceanic fungus could be used to put up spores over the ocean and encourage cloud formation.  Floating spore-beds might work better than floating mirrors.  Yet it's easier to sell mirrors... and encouraging cloud formation all across the ocean sounds like yet another wildly chaotic impetus.  I feel like the actual right answer to humanity's global climate regulation woes is going to flatten at least one city before we get the weather into a controllable state.
