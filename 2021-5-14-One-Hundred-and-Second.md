I won't be taking classes over the summer this year.  Not taking a math course is at the request of Kistaro; not taking any course is just a bit of personal despair over the low quality of laboratory simulations available in class.  Kistaro showed me a different source of laboratory simulation, but what good is that?  It's not what the course is using.

One of my old frustrations re: health is that health services are so hard to value economically.  The value of a health service is kind of the value of the person.  Kistaro convinced me that pure market provision has problems due to "the highwayman incentive", which is that healthcare providers have a rational incentive to demand all the money from anyone who partakes.  Bizarrely, it seems like public healthcare provision behaves the same way to a lesser extent, with inflating pricetags for unlimited needs.

I think this semblance of limitlessly expensive healthcare relates to something akin to the dearth of logistical talent by which vaccinating whole communities came to seem impossible.  Recognizing the medical needs of hundreds of millions of people simultaneously is not impossible.  Meeting all needs should have finite costs.  Medicine is not a luxury; people don't overconsume it.

It should be easier than it is to define which expenditures are economical.  I'm complaining, to be clear.  I'm not saying I know how to do it.  I think this will clarify as longevity research proceeds; with sufficient longevity, the economical medical expenditures are "all of them" and the non-luxury nature of medical requirements permits full supply.  In the absence of longevity research, economical expenses can only be defined by deciding at some point that people are too expensive to live.  Once people start making *that* decision, the consequences start eating demographics and defecating generational traumas.
