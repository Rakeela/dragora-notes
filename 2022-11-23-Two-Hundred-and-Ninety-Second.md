I jumped right in today, forgetting to mark my start-o-file.  Bad practice!  Fortunately, I have yesterday's completion value to compare to.  I'm starting today at 3,983 words on the file.  I have 4,384 on the file as of the point where I remembered that I need to record my productivity.  That's 401 words of progress, 1,266 words to go.

5,004 words.  That's 1,021 words of progress, 646 words to go.

5,725 words.  That's 1,742 words of progress, 75 words over quota.  It took me 4 hours to hit quota today, for about 436 words per hour of productivity.

5,847 words.  That's 1,864 words of progress, 197 words over quota.

I've been consistently flatulent since I cut sugar.  I've eaten quite a bit of it today.  Most of the sugar that I ate today was due to some mustard bbq beans that I grandfathered in.  I'm not willing to throw them out.  They're tasty and I bought them for myself.  However, I'm very disappointed to discover that I also ate 10g of sugar due to a sugared *olive oil sauce* in a steamable vegetable dish that I bought.

Today is my least flatulent day since cutting sugar.  It's also my highest sugar day since cutting sugar.  I think this is a coincidence.  I'm hoping my digestion will adapt to replacing sucrose with fructose.

I'm going to eat a burger tonight.  I'll eat it with lettuce "buns", but there's probably going to be sugar in the sauce on it.
