I was not a good fit for Puzzlebox.  I do believe in machine-assisted free will as a (potentially) real form of free will, but I didn't like the dubious consensuality of PBX.  Strangevirus had this atmospheric aspect to it; it did not give the impression of guided hostility to the consent of others so much as it gave me the impression of being an environmental hazard that was incidentally bad for mental health.  It struck me as a protector relative to the threats in the other Warps.
