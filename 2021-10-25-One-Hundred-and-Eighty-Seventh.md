I thought of a new euphemism today!  "Talking out of your earfins" would be a good replacement for "talking out of your ass".  It replaces the farting insult from "ass" with a reference to a part that *should* be listening, the ears!  I came up with a dragon version of it, but other people should try "Stop talking out of your ears," or "I shouldn't have been talking out of my ears about that."  When people talk about things they should be listening about, it's a very risky thing!
