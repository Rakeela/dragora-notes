I thought of a new euphemism today!  "Talking out of your earfins" would be a good replacement for "talking out of your ass".  It replaces the farting insult from "ass" with a reference to a part that *should* be listening, the ears!  I came up with a dragon version of it, but other people should try "Stop talking out of your ears," or "I shouldn't have been talking out of my ears about that."  When people talk about things they should be listening about, it's a very risky thing!

I've come up with a new flavor combination worth recording.  Olives and brazil nuts work well together.  I may get my mortar and pestle out to try grinding some together.  They seem like they'll be even better together if they're carefully measured out and then ground to semi-homogeneity.

I've realized another aspect of my past life today.  I long wondered why I-as-Rakeela wandered south as I did, and I've just realized that I didn't meet something I should've: the southern nations which he thought were ruled by the priests of the wind goddess, aka the shiny scaled dragons.

Where were Kairn's people?

I've thought of a potential treatment for overweight people!  This one's a pretty horrible idea, so brace yourself for incoming medical stupidity:  What if we could tag lipid cells in a region of the body with a bunch of microinjections, and then unleash an RNA vaccine that tells the immune system to eat the cells those tags are attached to?  It could be a new cosmetic surgery!  ...if it worked.  And didn't kill people.
