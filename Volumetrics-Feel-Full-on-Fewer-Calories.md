#Volumetrics-Feel-Full-on-Fewer-Calories

2021-7-13:  I'm breaking my usual rule that I only list bibliography items when I finish them, because I've realized that I want to take a few notes along the way.  I think this is a good exception.  I need to take more notes anyways.

First, a note that I recorded elsewhere which I should start with.  The proposal in the book to add energy density to nutrition information could be a good modifier to existing nutrition information regulations.

Secondly, the info that precipitated creating this card directly: you can eat quite a bit of bran flakes for 160 calories.  If you "sugar" them with a sugar substitute, the volume of bran flakes involved doesn't decrease.  In related thought, I think I can improve on the low-calorie salad dressings I've been able to find by making my own with sugar substitutes.  I'd enjoy salads more that way.
