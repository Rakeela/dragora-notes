#Volumetrics-Feel-Full-on-Fewer-Calories

2021-7-13:  I'm breaking my usual rule that I only list bibliography items when I finish them, because I've realized that I want to take a few notes along the way.  I think this is a good exception.  I need to take more notes anyways.

First, a note that I recorded elsewhere which I should start with.  The proposal in the book to add energy density to nutrition information could be a good modifier to existing nutrition information regulations.

Secondly, the info that precipitated creating this card directly: you can eat quite a bit of bran flakes for 160 calories.  If you "sugar" them with a sugar substitute, the volume of bran flakes involved doesn't decrease.  In related thought, I think I can improve on the low-calorie salad dressings I've been able to find by making my own with sugar substitutes.  I'd enjoy salads more that way.

I've thought before that the only books you truly own are the ones that you've read... but maybe I've been harsher than strictly logical in that respect.  I've only considered myself to 'own' books that I read *completely*.  Maybe I should instead consider myself to 'own' (and have read) any book that made a meaningful adjustment to my thinking.  In that case, any book that inspires me to take notes could deserve a Bibliography entry, and the Bibliography section could begin to serve as a notes-organizing section.
