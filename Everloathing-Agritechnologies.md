#Everloathing-Agritechnologies

Everloathing Agritechnologies is a company that I'm considering founding as a [[springboard-company]] for my long-term plan to someday found [[Otter-Labs]].  Everloathing is not the company that I want to found; frankly, that's [[Black-Rose-Beverages]].  This contributed to its name.  The other reason it's called Everloathing is that, from childhood, people around me used my supposedly hateful and angry behavior as a way to rebuke and control me.

I was a tearful child who could not even speak naughty words, yet I was supposedly living on the edge of rage.  I was not to be angry.  Ever.  Really, I believe I wasn't to *complain*.  That pressure *deformed* me.  In my attempts to be what others needed me to be, in trying to be acknowledged as the polite anti-authoritarian that I wanted to be, I became someone "useless".  Everloathing's name makes a joke of all that.  The first major Everloathing product that I want to try to develop is also named to joke about that: the Chives of Wrath.

Everloathing's mission statement is going to be, "We Hate Famine and Sickness."  I plan to have that painted on the wall of the office somewhere visible.  Despite my intention to use it as a springboard, the company is meant to do very good things in the world.

I'm planning to organize my research under this card.
