I'm reading "Parable of the Sower" for class.  It's infuriating.  It blames some of the usual targets.  Lack of labor law enforcement, for example.  Too many fees on government services.  Yet what keeps striking me and upsetting me is that the whole setting is obviously *really* trash because the people who populate it are apparently sexbot replicants who don't care enough about their kids to have two or fewer of them.

Bad childcare standards.  Like natalists usually have.  So they get a violently impoverished world that doesn't care about *anyone*, because they can't think of having kids as a cause of suffering.

I'm 15% into the book and I'm taking a break.  I need to read it in a few days, but I'll get there.  Maybe I'm just bitter, but I bet the book isn't going to mention a damn thing against its good family theme.  Because even though they're the worst parents and the very ones who create nightmares for future generations if not sometimes their *own* generation, natalists always think they're good with families, and that there's a great essential beauty in their families.

This is why humanity ought to be reproducing with the help of geneticists and diversican cloning initiatives.  Cloning doesn't have to mean 'homogenous'.  It won't!  It'll mean diversity thrives as people seek different forms.  And families will finally stay small, stably.  Without small family populations getting outbred by abusive natalists.

While I'm here, I resent that the book talks about privatizing fire services as something associated with an increase in arson.  How very Nationstates.  Yeah, I know the book predates Nationstates, but it just ties it in together with a swathe of 'liberal' culture that really ruined things and set the stage for regressions in health, science, and civil rights, treating anyone who didn't agree with them and do things their way as rude and authoritarian.  I got menaced by THAT in a way that no child should be!  By liberals who weren't.

So now I'm a bitter liberal who is, because I still believe in the ideals that made me vulnerable to liberals who weren't, and I'm more rude than I was as a child though no less pacifistic, stuck living in a society that treats pacifism and civil rights as opposed to each other.  As if it were protective of civil rights to leave people to die of disease and violence!  As if civil rights were the reward of being forever on your toes in crowds that violate whoever they deem ignorant.  Awful.  Civil rights are the cause of pacifism.  Always have been.  Gay people who were getting murdered for being gay weren't having their civil rights protected, that was the issue.  Murder is contrary to civil rights.

So is disease!  Filthy societies are xenophobic.  Disease-ridden societies fear outsiders who might be contaminated.  Violence hits the same way.  The sick, coughing 'liberalism' of history brings with it this peculiarly unliberated fear outsiders might be carrying bad spirits in their head or their microbes.  Hygiene makes people willing to get closer to each other in every way.  It's good for liberalism, yet we let society get to the point where vaccinations were treated as authoritarian.  That's very Nationstates, too.  The game treats health and hygiene as hostile to civil rights.  History IRL went the other way.

The game treats populations with Islam-esque mores as polite, too.  It treats the populations that would lobotomize women and dress them in hijabs as polite.  It treats the populations that overbreed and crush the world in the misery of crying children as polite (and compassionate!).  There are ways to play the game to increase politeness without agreeing to anything horrific, and sometimes you can cram policies together in ways that make sensible judgments where the game tries to block them, but it's jammed under sick biases.  The game treats conservatism as polite, psychological abuse as political freedom, and slavery as freedom.

Parable of the Sower just reminds me so strongly of Nationstates.  It seems like it comes from the same knot of authoritarian false liberalism that damaged the first world's potential in the past few decades.  It's so polemic, and...  well, I'm only 15% in, I admit.  I just had to vent some of the frustration of having to read it.
