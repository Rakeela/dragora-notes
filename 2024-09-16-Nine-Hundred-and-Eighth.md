7:36.  I had a lot of trouble getting up this morning.  I felt very stuck to the bed, and I was in some amount of pain.  I wasn't paralyzed.  I *could* move.  My muscles just felt very fatigued.  I wanted to groan with the struggle.

7:38.  My chest hurts.  There's a sense of strain in my chest.  There was two minutes ago as well.  It's not changing.  It's not getting better or worse.  It's just uncomfortable.  I hope it passes.

7:44.  Ugh.  I can't enjoy an energy drink while my chest hurts.  It doesn't feel right to combine those sensations.

8:04.  The chest pain receded somewhat, not even completely, and I opened an energy drink.

8:15.  25,454.

20:00.  32,873.  7,419 words of progress.  Hey, coming up on twelve hours here.

20:01.  11.8 miles.  2,055 kcal.  43,752 steps.  9 hours, 5 minutes, and 14 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.

20:50.  33,706.  8,252 words of progress.

21:20.  Whoa, I got hardcore distracted.  No progress since the last time point.  I've been reading the Cupman wiki.  Man, there is so much awesome culture in this world!  I think I'm in love.  I want to live forever just to keep on top of culture.
