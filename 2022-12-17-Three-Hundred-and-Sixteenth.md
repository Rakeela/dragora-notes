134 hours in.  I went to bed feeling horribly exhausted.  I woke up feeling weak and unwell.

135.5 hours.  I'm suffering diarrhea.  There can't be much of this; there isn't much to purge from my gut.  My appetite is crazy weak.  I've been nibbling on the same protein pastry for an hour and a half.  Getting sick has always called off fasts, but according to a paper I read yesterday, transient infections aren't actually an indication for stopping a fast.

137 hours.  I finished that protein pastry.  Ugggh, I feel demoralized.  I'm not even hungry.  I'm just tempted to break fast because I feel terrible.  Despite having stocked a huge amount of candy, I've had an unusual density of meat cravings during this fast.  I'd presently rather eat a falafel ball than something from my candy stash.

138 hours.  I haven't been able to bring myself to write yet.

139 hours.  197 hours remain.  No writing.  No editing.  My weight plateaued.  Why did my weight plateau?  My mood is a complete mess today.

Starting writing on a new file.  602 words needed today.

229 words.  373 words remaining.  Progress is glacial.

143 hours.  I've been weighing myself repeatedly today.  After the first *seventeen pounds* melted off disturbingly quickly, further progress in weight loss has also been glacial.  I was expecting a faster rate of fat-burning than this.  It's not like I have no experience to inform the expectation.

I may not be getting enough exercise.

---
1,133 words.  528 words over quota.  Inspiration started flowing much more readily once I was writing to procrastinate on exercise.  I've been jiggling a leg, too.  Being just about to exercise seems to have woken up my metabolism.  Now it's time to actually do it.
