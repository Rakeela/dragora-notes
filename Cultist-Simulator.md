#Cultist-Simulator

Copied from [[2022-09-19-Two-Hundred-and-Sixty-First]]:
"I noticed something in Cultist Simulator about the Forge and the Lantern.  The lantern lore declares that reality is unmerciful, but the Forge subverts the Lantern.  You can subvert away the unmerciful nature of reality... and Forge is the path that can exalt peaceful immortals."

Extending from this, Forge is the path that "won" and all power in society is the power of Forge.  The other paths of immortality are now forbidden.  Forge ascension shouldn't be illegal per se, but the present victors don't usually like to rearrange their plans to accommodate new powers.

Welcome to my Cultist Simulator page.  I use this game to try to focus creatively.  I see its arcane principles as a suggestion of narrative causality, and I've assembled a set of my own that I use as an alternative suggestion of narrative causality.  The Cultist Simulator principles are bloodthirsty and mostly merciless; my own are peaceful and mostly merciful.
