I have thought of something that would be disastrous were it true.  It is not of course something to which I can give any evidence; it is purely a fantasy.  A counterfactual scenario of a possible horror...  Imagine that humanity were to encounter a species where pedophilia is psychologically beneficial.

I thought of this when my husband reminded me in conversation about a trait of the psychology of pedophiles that I had not given much thought to in the past: they insist that their contact with children is *beneficial*.  This puts them in the same category as many people unduly persecuted for sexual offenses with no victim, positioning the pedophile as one class among the classes of people harmed by the arbitrary intolerances of society.  We know of course that this categorization is wrong, but in many eras... that wasn't known yet, and humanity has fumbled this in multiple time periods.

Knowing as we do today that the claim of the pedophile to benevolence is incorrect in a scientific way rather than a hateful way, we have begun as a society to separate out cases that were previously conflated, most notably we now know to separate homosexuality and pedophilia.  That is one of the major advances of liberalism.

Now, having figured that out, imagine if there was another species where the same question arose and was likewise decided by science rather than hatred... but their species' minds were different such that their science yielded the other answer.  This is conceivable!  Just as some of the people who approached this issue without hatred in prior generations...  Well, for us, those made catastrophic *life-ruining* errors... but those errors were what yielded our scientific understanding of the necessary divide.  If the defense of the pedophile that they were unduly hated had simply been correct, the same experiments would have had positive outcomes.  The relaxation of authority in this matter would have been purely and simply correct, as it ultimately was towards so many 'deviant' human sexualities.

Every species likely has psychological peculiarities, and *this* peculiarity is one of the ones that would be among the most catastrophic to a first contact scenario.  It would bar the children of two species from interacting with each other.  There would be no hatred or xenophobia in noting that human children would likely be traumatized by exposure to their society.  Likewise even, their children would be raised less well among us.

I would say that if humanity encountered such a species, we should *go forth* with first contact, but we should do it only through official diplomatic channels with both sides permitting contact only between well-informed adults.  It should be above-board.  I think humanity can understand that species psychology will not always permit close integration.
