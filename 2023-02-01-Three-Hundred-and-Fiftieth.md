I accidentally double-tapped the pause button on my treadmill, ending the steady recording.  I walked 2.7 miles at 1.4 mph, burning an estimated 470 kcal.  It took me 1 hour, 55 minutes, and 53 seconds.  This isn't likely to be the full distance I walk on the treadmill today.

I'm two hours and two energy drinks into my day, but I weighed myself and found it said 250.2 pounds... without my favorite sweater on.  With my favorite sweater on, it said 251.0 pounds.  So I lost 0.2 pounds overnight?  Anyways, I'm going to go buy another falafel wrap.  That was delicious yesterday.

Another 3 hours, 26 minutes, and 40 seconds on the treadmill.  5.1 miles at 1.4 mph, burning an estimated 851 kcal.  I don't know why it summarized me at 1.4 mph, I thought I was at 1.5 for nearly the entire time.  I think this thing reports 0.1 mph under the speed you were actually at.  Anyways.  That's 7.8 miles an an estimated burn of 1,321 kcal.

The scale says I weigh 251.4 pounds now.  It's gotta be water weight.
