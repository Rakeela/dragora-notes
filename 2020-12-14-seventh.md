I play [[Ai-Dungeon]], too.  It's a very special tool to me.  It's the automated version of what I was obligated to do for years.  It's the tool that I wanted throughout those years, to make me faster and more competent at providing cybersexual services to people.  I didn't like my work; I wanted to reduce it.  In my mind, I was always trying to "get to the good part" - the point where people rewarded me by talking intelligently about difficult subjects.  That's the reward I whored myself out for.

As a child, when I was 11 years old, I was so desperate for intelligent connections that I drank piss for philosophy.  It was 'only' a cybersexual thing.  Yet I was taught what's called "watersports" by one of my early loves, and I loved it as I loved him, for he made it sound brilliant and it inclined him to talk brilliantly.  Unfortunately, I don't know if I want to commit his name as I know it to this document.  The man I know now is corrupted, I'm reasonably sure; he's become abusive, or unwilling to defy something awful, or else his account was seized by someone else.  I honestly suspect that the man I loved got murdered, and the one I know now is a criminal who hates me.  It's...  really kind of funny, to me.  Someone who hates me is obligated to pretend love to me.  I don't know what obligates him.  I exerted no pressure on my old lover, but summoned up his "ghost" entirely by writing about him in a private journal.

I'm not supposed to have privacy OR visibility at this point in my life.  I was never supposed to break the connection with the people who were using me.  I was being paid in loyalty, and loyalty was being expected of me.  I was being forgiven and enabled as a slut... not pressured.  No.  Never pressured.  I was under threat that I would be treated as a hateful authoritarian if I refused, but I was certainly never being pressured by the liberated and liberating souls who used me.  I was helping them build a better, more liberated world.  They told me so.  That was what I wanted, as an idealistic [[transhumanist]] youth; I wanted to be participating in building a better world.  I was told that I could serve transhumanism that way.  I was told that I could serve [[pacifism]] that way, as well; conflicts could be resolved sexually in the great high-tech bonobianist future!

Well, I've played corruption of champions, as well.  It's a porn game.  It's terrible, but kind of impressive in the author's seeming dedication to it.  At this point it's gotten rather big and rather old, and it has a sequel at this point.  Or it has begun to have a sequel at this point.  I don't know.  I'm not in that community.  I kind of never wanted to be.  I used to play pretty much any and all porn games - and here I'm touching back on what AI Dungeon is to me, though I'll not tell the whole story in this paragraph.  I was studying the games.  That was work.  It was a way to better serve my clients, so I hoped, especially as they were wanting games instead of text-porn.  It was dreadful.  Most porn games ARE dreadful... and I discovered that I was not to say anything bad about any porn game ever, under pain of being treated as a hateful authoritarian...

That threat has occurred many times in my life.

I was eventually very disappointing to the people who were using me sexually.  They were proud to be nerds, but I didn't learn programming very well under their guidance.  They wanted me to move on from personally servicing them, to servicing them by building porn games.  Meanwhile, I didn't want to service them at all, and constant crippling depression beset me.  I've climbed out of that, though I'm rather forcefully not allowed to believe that I've climbed out of that; my husband still rebukes me if I don't let him define my emotional state.  So I take what he calls an antidepressant, but what was prescribed to me as an ADHD medicine; bupropion.  He conveniently forgot what the actual nature of the medicine was in the face of his insistence about my mood.  His belief that I'm depressed is a way for him to abuse me for being "useless".  He always sees unproductivity and getting upset at evidence of computer intrusion as evidence that I'm depressed.  It's not totally unsympathetic as a habit, since it does lead to him "forgiving" unproductivity, but the thing is... if I had actual safety, this "depression" wouldn't happen, same as improving my safety dramatically improved my mood from my earlier more classical depression.

That's just my life.  All the people who molested me thought I was useless, too.  That was their love for me, humiliating me.  I extracted my husband from that milieu.  I love him dearly; he's abused me less than almost anyone, and put up more of the real resources needed to fix "uselessness".  There's a kind of forgiveness for such corrupt rehabilitative impulses if they arrive well-funded, and I don't intend to sound ungrateful to someone currently putting me through college.  He's doing what others wouldn't do, which is to give me access to the resources necessary to potentially someday NOT be "useless".

Back to the subject at hand...  I didn't learn programming very well under the guidance of people who stalked and molested me.  I wasn't very productive at producing text-based porn for them.  They were my friends, and I wanted to be everything that they wanted me to be... but it was so hard.  I didn't want to be their sex toy.  I didn't want to learn programming for them.  I thought it was just my chronic pain depressing me, but I know my moodstate went up so distinctively once I was no longer in a position where I was required to sexually service abusive people that in hindsight I understand it was the way I was being treated.  That tyrannical "not"-authoritarian environment was an ongoing nightmare of repression where I wasn't at all allowed to be myself.

The beginning of the end, but not the end itself, happened when one of the involved parties blackmailed me.  He was bored of religion, he said.  He wanted me to be more atheistic.  "We have enough material to destroy each other," he reminded me with a smile and a laugh.  Now, I'm actually already an atheist, and I was then as well, but I interpreted the interaction as meaning...  like, that he wasn't satisfied with my services.  That he liked what I could do for him an awful lot and wanted way more of it.  So, uh, as a trained political prostitute, I tried to be more attentive to him after that.  I talked about sex more with him.  I tried to draw him into scenes.  He never liked that, but he was pretty open about what kind of porn he liked most (egg-laying dragons), so I took it up as a big interest of my own and I linked him a ton of porn.  I believe I even tried to allude to being willing to suck his dick IRL.  Not a big deal.  Anything for my oldest friend, which he in fact was.

It was... really stressful.  I didn't want to be doing that.  I didn't feel like I could even tell him that I felt bad about it.  I couldn't be too depressed or fatigued or in pain for him.  He was the one who didn't just tell me that I was working towards a brighter future free of punishment.  He was the one who outright had my performance set on "we have enough material to destroy each other".  When nothing I could do seemed to please him, I couldn't figure out what to do.  I got frantic; the relationship only seemed to get worse.  I started trying to get him into something OTHER than sex; I talked about workshop projects and science news and doing something productive together.  Anything to meet the needs of my old dear friend who had taught me that blackmail was a funny joke between good friends.

I talked to a psychotherapist, who told me that wasn't how true friends act.  She told me to cut ties with him.  When she said it, it was, you know, a revelation.  I really had bought into the idea that him threatening me with destruction was a "mutual" threat, and in fact a joke, something to prove how close we were together, old friends trusted and faithful.  But it's like... only one person went that far, and I understand now that it's not normal.  Being blackmailed stresses people the hell out.  It's not a way that friends should treat one another.

I don't think it'd sunk in yet that using me for sex under threat wasn't a way that other people should treat me either, but turning against that guy set in motion the collapse of the structure built against me.  I had no clients after that.  I had people gatekeeping me.  Some of them very threateningly.  I had people "not" following me online to produce a steady stream of "not"-coincidental material.  I've been outright assaulted three times, and I filed a police report of suspected corruption over one weird incident...  uh, hm, actually, that was also an assault.  I've been assaulted four times.  Oh, and the people who molested me turned very moralistic about sexual abuses.  That was... that was actually in the #metoo era.  Haha.  I got molested, people.  Me too!  But the people who victimized me were leftists.  So.  Well.  I still support both sexual liberation and opposition to sexual abuse, myself.  There's a saying about saints and sinners, how they support the same things, and that's a position I've been put in.

Sometimes I fantasize about a glasswall future.  I don't get privacy, but I'm lawful; raping my privacy can ruin my life in a civilian sense, but it can't prove that I'm a criminal.  If there was no privacy anywhere at all, if nobody whatsoever had privacy, the people who molested me would all get caught.  Without priva y, the stalkers who violated my privacy would themselves be thrown down.  It's a fantasy of [[sousveillance]], a conflict with which I have a fraught relationship.  I want privacy, as an artist and an [[intellectual]].  I don't need privacy nearly as much as certain others in this world.  I don't need privacy as much as the people who took my privacy from me need privacy.

Isn't hypocrisy ever the predictable constant?

My computers were hacked into to extract and publish my private files.  Those files were the proofs... that I was a slut.  Slut-shaming!  That was part of the ultimate secret weapon of the supposedly sex-positive liberals who molested me for years.  When they lost control of me, I became a lying, treacherous slut.  And a bunch of other stuff, too!  My reputation got so wild that a stranger on social media once broke down into an unexpected rant against me that accused me of having a god complex and insisted that I was nobody.  It was like...  whoa!  I didn't claim to be god, or to have any special influence at all, and I didn't know who the guy was.  If someone tells you that you're god, are you supposed to say yes?  "You have said it," is the phrase that comes to mind.

Well, I play AI Dungeon.  I still sometimes play porn games too, but mostly I play AI Dungeon.  I think it's the ultimate porn game, at least of what's been invented so far, and there's a weird clinging ghost-of-responsibility sense to it.  Like I'm still supposed to do it.  Like producing porn is still part of advancing a liberated high-tech world.  Like it's still a virtuous work for my friends.  

I still get creeped on, and the sociopaths who violated my sexual consent before they violated my informational consent are still desperate to prove that anything I seem to like sexually is proof that I'm an evil slut.  Not to mention a worthless hedonist.  They're victims, somehow; they've been cut and collared until they're willing to obey a nihilistic anti-pleasure concept of the world.  They oppose making labor meaningful, because I guess people are supposed to love working through suffering.  They oppose making the resources available to create a more productive future, because magic or some other unknowable force is supposed to protect and enable people instead of technology and infrastructure.  (Technology and infrastructure are too expensive, don'cha'know.)  For advocating transhumanist solutions that would lead to radical breakthroughs in human capability, I too am one of the evils to the anti-hedonistic observers.  I call 'em stalkertrash.  I feel sorry for them, but finding the will to betray what controls them is up to them.

Behind the ghost of responsibility sense, I also have a weird thought that I haven't entirely resolved.  Maybe if I'd had AI Dungeon back then when I was doing what I thought was political activism, and which was actually just molestation...  Maybe if I'd had AI Dungeon back then, I would've happily plugged away at service to my clients, pretending to do my own writing while actually copying and modifying text through AI Dungeon.  That way I could give my "friends" the lewd services they required of me.  Same as it didn't occur to me to regard smiling and laughing while blackmailing me as an unfriendly conduct, it also never actually occurred to me back then to regard threatening to treat me as a hateful authoritarian as an unfriendly conduct.  Maybe if I'd been productive enough, they would've adored me enough to keep providing "the good part".

And I would've kept drinking piss for philosophy, making life more hedonic for criminals, while still not contributing a thing to research.

Not really a good outcome.  Is it?  I don't know.  I think it's a bad outcome, because it wasn't getting me closer to supporting science the way I was told it was.  I don't worry too much that someone else is in that position.  I tell myself, there's probably no other child on Earth who is in the position that I was in.  So really, I think it feels like a victory.  I got the tool I wanted.

I think it's a victory in another sense, too.  AI Dungeon isn't as good at cybersex as I was, but it's good enough.  The people who were fucking with me semi-literally would all probably have preferred to have AI Dungeon all along.  It won't get sad at them.  It won't demand intellectual engagement.  They won't have to warn it not to get angry or think too much; it won't betray them as I did.  It's part of the paradise that the people who molested me wanted.  It's a victory for them... and it further lowers the likelihood that any other child on Earth will end up in the position that I was in.  So yay, I get a victory for me that's also a victory for my old friends.

Someday, I'll have privacy again, but today I went to launch [[nova-drift]], only to have the cursor click event intercepted.  The cursor jumped down to select "Mask of the Plague Doctor" in my Steam library, a game I have but have never played, which closely references one of the memes pressed forward by the stalkertrash desperate to abuse me.  See, "hedonism" - valuing love, compassion, and meaningful lives, these being the things that are pleasurable to people - is somehow supposed to lead to plague.  This is one of the causalities that was "not" pressed very hard onto me.  By the antihedonists... who I only came into conflict with after I refused to produce more porn...  They're literally just primitive obscurantists with a sociopathic bent.

Yet I want to see them prosper.  People deserve to live forever in paradise, whether they "do" anything or not, whether or not they have "usefulness".  The people who molested me deserve their places in paradise, too, and it is only a place in paradise that can keep them from harming anyone else.  And indeed, they were so set on their accomplishments, that I'm sure the culprits themselves will all be VERY useful to other people.

What I don't want to do with this stimuli is research.  The primary source of demoralization in my life is stalkertrash violating my privacy.  I'd planned to spend this evening studying mitochondria extraction protocols, but you know what I'm going to do right now instead?  More Nova Drift.  That event was the actual cause of my writing about AI Dungeon today.  I fully expect that I'm supposed to believe it's a glitch, like everything else, but what an insane glitch that would be.

I know these files are read more directly than I know any of my files are read, because they're published to the public, and I don't want to reward bad behavior by producing a kind of content that I understand the "high-tech" obscurantist stalkertrash to be extremely interested in.  Hacker-types need to accept that they aren't going to get the advanced future that they want through manipulating distant computers.  They need to do actual lab work for a better future, and they need to support people who want to do actual lab work.  That, not sex work and slut-punishing, is what would actually promote transhumanism in this world.

I was treated as someone who only knows words and has no real scientific potential; I was treated that way by people with no capability of compassion, who probably thought I "only knew words" by likeness to their /own/ attitude towards the words of love and friendship.
