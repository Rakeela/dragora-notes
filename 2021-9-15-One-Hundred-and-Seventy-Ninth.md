I stopped reading a book that struck me as offering good and essential advice on worldbuilding, to instead read a book that struck me as offering empty advice that I can't use on worldbuilding, but which has better prose.  Eventually, I'll read both, but I was struck by the way that one is a page-turner (despite being useless) while the other (more usable) one is a slog.

Usability is only imperfectly correlated with information quality, when it comes to books.

Thinking about The Viceroy gives me an eerie sense of having been in a society it could describe in my last lifetime.  We were dangerous-yet-pacifistic shapeshifters being superceded by a shapeshifter-hunting agrarian society that outbred us...  Kairn dwelled in a cathedral, and was murdered by a mind-controlling priestess of his religion...  The wind faith was strongest in the southern nations where their priests were culturally powerful figures who walked in the open, sunlight glinting off their shining scales.

The more I think about it, the more I think there were traces of past technological attainments greatly exceeding what was 'the present' in that society, where we were just tinkering with machinery and thought crossbows were pretty cool.  We were struggling to industrialize 'for the first time', but I can explain our endowments pretty well if I ditch the idea of 'magic' and assume that there was a preceding nanotech age which collapsed into ignorant superstition.  We forgot how our senses truly worked; we forgot who we were and what we were truly capable of.  We were adopting Commonwealth mores even as we were being destroyed by a Commonwealth society.

If I were to represent that struggle in The Viceroy, I'd represent it as Panarchy->Commonwealth->Imperial, aka the Imperial Reformers, treating the feudal agrarian society that was extinguishing the shapeshifters as a bridge rather than a terminus.  That feudal society was out conquering nature in the name of natalism, but they weren't really hugely populous compared to the nations of Earth, however aghast we might've been at the way they stomped over the terrain and destroyed it with their rapacity.  That said, the Imperial Reformers aren't quite right either, because they have 'superscalar towers' and 'superconductive grids' as basic technologies.  No analogue was in sight.  So if I instead ignore the population scale mismatch, it could instead seem like an Imperial->Panarchy->Commonwealth (aka Commonwealth Consensus) struggle in which the industrial period was thoroughly gone with its ideologies abandoned, leaving behind a decayed feudal society with a monofocus on the Commonwealth and no knowledge of how to produce grand industrial wonders.

The whole scale of populations in that lifetime was a lot lower than anything in The Viceroy, and indeed lower than the scale of populations on Earth.  There were merely thousands of us (dragons), and low-tech feudal agrarianism corresponds to much lower population densities than modern Earth nations possess (millions of people, not hundreds of millions).

I think The Viceroy makes the basic populations much too large; Earth should correspond to a 5-district planet with two Wealth 2 districts (representing North America, Australia, and Western Europe), two Wealth 1 districts (representing South America, Eastern Europe, and Asia), and a single Wealth 0 district (representing Africa).  The total population of that should still be 7 billion at those Wealth levels, with most of the districts filled out.  Yet it clearly would be more in The Viceroy!  As well, take note that Africa is fast-growing IRL despite being a pre-civilization unable to contribute to the technical development of Earth, corresponding therefore to Wealth 0 (where its growth should be minimal).  This corresponds to my own intuitions about how Wealth and Population Growth interact, but The Viceroy is hostile to my intuitions about that dynamic with its massively growing 'Wealthy' populations.

*My* intuition is still that as societies grow Wealthier, their carrying capacity increases, but their crowding tolerance falls.  This means that at Wealth 0, societies badly overcrowd (slums forever), but at Wealth 1 their population *increases* even though they grow *less* crowded (more parks and taller apartments).  This trend should strengthen until eventually the intolerance of crowding is excessive enough to cause populations to start dwindling at high Wealth (a society of mansion-dwellers would surely rather not reproduce than have kids who live in tenements).

All of this would increase the value of the -Crowding and +Population technologies, which I think are undervalued by the game's current model.  The anti-crowding technologies in particular are my favorite in the game, as each one permits more people to live peacefully in more varied environments.  They don't increase population by packing people in more tightly, save in the most technical sense; really, they increase population by giving people more living space at each crowding level.  The ultimate expression of this is the Dyson Swarm technology, which expands society throughout each star system.  The ability of a Dyson Swarm to grant people massive amounts of living space is limited only by the reliance of many endeavors on a nearby planetary body.  It would increase the population density of the star system as a whole, but density would decrease on every smaller scale save the (initially zero) density of the vacuum, giving people far more living space.

I've been considering a petty creative project with *no* obvious applicability to my 'real' projects.  I want to take some of the characters in my [[character-gallery]] and have them play a game of "Our Pantheon" together.  This is the thought that moved me to add Vennaveld to the gallery, something I had been considering doing, but uncertain of.

I'd say it's more productive than playing The Viceroy, but it's kind of not at this point...  I've written so much about The Viceroy that I really do believe at this point that I'll publish a book of commentary on it.  It's become one of my 'real' projects.  Once I finish first-pass analysis, I'll create a typeset model book (with a lot of lorem ipsum) to define the content parameters that I have to match my prose to.  Then I'll rewrite-to-parameters.  Finally, I'll show the book to artists and commission the necessary graphics.

Fittingly enough, I expect to lose money.  The Viceroy truly is a game about losing money, aye.

I really see a lot more rehabilitative potential in the Panarchy's technology.  If their commitment to liberty were true enough, they *would* be the gentle power to the Commonwealth's authority.  They need more +Happiness technologies, though.  It's hard to value any "ideology" too primitive to care about the Happiness of people, and it suggests that the Panarchic commitment to the Will is deeply, deeply false, as a truly reciprocal recognition of many Wills would recognize that Happiness *is* the common objective of the myriad Wills.  Plus, there *are* ways to make people more strong-willed and more happy at the same time, hence my suggestions of Dream Reeves (for the Informalists) and Voluntary Order (for the Ritualists).

The Commonwealth seems to regard people as disposable.  No need to help the fallen, just kick 'em out and breed replacements.  The Old Empire's ideology of fungibility (from the Imperial segment right next to the Commonwealth on the ideology wheel) suggests that they have this problem, too.

Conversely, Mental Transcription is a terrifying but rehabilitative technology which would make adult education centers into something that could carry society... if the Panarchy were liberated enough.  If the Panarchy's defense of the myriad Wills and commitment to diversity were true enough.  If the Panarchy is sufficiently willing to give up controlling people, as the defense of the reciprocal Will requires, Mental Transcription becomes an apex technology of gentle love for others.  The true will is not the tyrant's single unary will, but the many wills of people who value many different things.

If the Panarchy truly does not value happiness, I would favor the Commonwealth forever.  Any government which is not organized to advance the happiness of the public is tyrannical.  Happiness is the ultimate objective of the will of sapient beings.  It is not possible to build a technology of the will without defending happiness, and to do so is deeply, deeply false.  A deep falsehood like that should never win.  Therefore, all societies must be governed in defense of happiness, else tyranny wins.

If the Panarchy truly does not value happiness, they can only be justly left behind, for the whole structure of their culture is then formed of ethically primitive psychological abuse.  Indeed, it is even *authoritarianism*.  If the Panarchy truly does not value happiness, the accusation of authoritarianism that they levy against the Commonwealth constitutes the falsehood known as DARVO, and the Panarchy are the true authoritarians.

Were my soul's allegiance judged by my work on The Viceroy, it is on this contingency that I would stake my claim: **whichever faction is most dedicated to resolving misery by helping people feel better is the truly virtuous one**.

Were I myself judged a Panarchist while another faction were judged the truly virtuous one by that metric, I would be morally obligated to undertake the reform of the Panarchy to address and mitigate its corruption and authoritarianism, so that the Panarchy would no longer have the right to devour people exceeding it in ethics.
