I stopped reading a book that struck me as offering good and essential advice on worldbuilding, to instead read a book that struck me as offering empty advice that I can't use on worldbuilding, but which has better prose.  Eventually, I'll read both, but I was struck by the way that one is a page-turner (despite being useless) while the other (more usable) one is a slog.
