I stopped reading a book that struck me as offering good and essential advice on worldbuilding, to instead read a book that struck me as offering empty advice that I can't use on worldbuilding, but which has better prose.  Eventually, I'll read both, but I was struck by the way that one is a page-turner (despite being useless) while the other (more usable) one is a slog.

Usability is only imperfectly correlated with information quality, when it comes to books.

Thinking about The Viceroy gives me an eerie sense of having been in a society it could describe in my last lifetime.  We were dangerous-yet-pacifistic shapeshifters being superceded by a shapeshifter-hunting agrarian society that outbred us...  Kairn dwelled in a cathedral, and was murdered by a mind-controlling priestess of his religion...  The wind faith was strongest in the southern nations where their priests were culturally powerful figures who walked in the open, sunlight glinting off their shining scales.

The more I think about it, the more I think there were traces of past technological attainments greatly exceeding what was 'the present' in that society, where we were just tinkering with machinery and thought crossbows were pretty cool.  We were struggling to industrialize 'for the first time', but I can explain our endowments pretty well if I ditch the idea of 'magic' and assume that there was a preceding nanotech age which collapsed into ignorant superstition.  We forgot how our senses truly worked; we forgot who we were and what we were truly capable of.  We were adopting Commonwealth mores even as we were being destroyed by a Commonwealth society.

If I were to represent that struggle in The Viceroy, I'd represent it as Panarchy->Commonwealth->Imperial, aka the Imperial Reformers, treating the feudal agrarian society that was extinguishing the shapeshifters as a bridge rather than a terminus.  That feudal society was out conquering nature in the name of natalism, but they weren't really hugely populous compared to the nations of Earth, however aghast we might've been at the way they stomped over the terrain and destroyed it with their rapacity.  That said, the Imperial Reformers aren't quite right either, because they have 'superscalar towers' and 'superconductive grids' as basic technologies.  No analogue was in sight.  So if I instead ignore the population scale mismatch, it could instead seem like an Imperial->Panarchy->Commonwealth (aka Commonwealth Consensus) struggle in which the industrial period was thoroughly gone with its ideologies abandoned, leaving behind a decayed feudal society with a monofocus on the Commonwealth and no knowledge of how to produce grand industrial wonders.

The whole scale of populations in that lifetime was a lot lower than anything in The Viceroy, and indeed lower than the scale of populations on Earth.  There were merely thousands of us (dragons), and low-tech feudal agrarianism corresponds to much lower population densities than modern Earth nations possess (millions of people, not hundreds of millions).

I think The Viceroy makes the basic populations much too large; Earth should correspond to a 5-district planet with two Wealth 2 districts (representing North America, Australia, and Western Europe), two Wealth 1 districts (representing South America, Eastern Europe, and Asia), and a single Wealth 0 district (representing Africa).  The total population of that should still be 7 billion at those Wealth levels, with most of the districts filled out.  Yet it clearly would be more in The Viceroy!  As well, take note that Africa is fast-growing IRL despite being a pre-civilization unable to contribute to the technical development of Earth, corresponding therefore to Wealth 0 (where its growth should be minimal).  This corresponds to my own intuitions about how Wealth and Population Growth interact, but The Viceroy is hostile to my intuitions about that dynamic with its massively growing 'Wealthy' populations.

*My* intuition is still that as societies grow Wealthier, their carrying capacity increases, but their crowding tolerance falls.  This means that at Wealth 0, societies badly overcrowd (slums forever), but at Wealth 1 their population *increases* even though they grow *less* crowded (more parks and taller apartments).  This trend should strengthen until eventually the intolerance of crowding is excessive enough to cause populations to start dwindling at high Wealth (a society of mansion-dwellers would surely rather not reproduce than have kids who live in tenements).

All of this would increase the value of the -Crowding and +Population technologies, which I think are undervalued by the game's current model.  The anti-crowding technologies in particular are my favorite in the game, as each one permits more people to live peacefully in more varied environments.  They don't increase population by packing people in more tightly, save in the most technical sense; really, they increase population by giving people more living space at each crowding level.  The ultimate expression of this is the Dyson Swarm technology, which expands society throughout each star system.  The ability of a Dyson Swarm to grant people massive amounts of living space is limited only by the reliance of many endeavors on a nearby planetary body.  It would increase the population density of the star system as a whole, but density would decrease on every smaller scale save the (initially zero) density of the vacuum, giving people far more living space.

I've been considering a petty creative project with *no* obvious applicability to my 'real' projects.  I want to take some of the characters in my [[character-gallery]] and have them play a game of "Our Pantheon" together.  This is the thought that moved me to add Vennaveld to the gallery, something I had been considering doing, but uncertain of.
