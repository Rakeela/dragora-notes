#Otter-Labs

Otter Labs is my childhood dream.  Well, one of them.  I wanted to be a science-allied politician in childhood.  I wrote about global unification under a pacifist government dedicated to the sciences...  I should give that it's own card in my archive someday.  Being a transhumanist CEO was second highest on my list of longings, and Otter Labs was the company that I wanted to found.

Otter Labs was meant to be a place where people to go to be turned into otters and/or dragons.  Transformation as a service!  This silly idea was part of a wide interest in transformations and cyborgs.  It was to be a biotech company advancing humanity's control of anatomy.
