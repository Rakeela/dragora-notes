I haven't really wanted to write a straight-up blog post lately.  There's still a lot of patience between myself and being able to actualize any of the things I fantasize about, even if I have reduced my present fantasy to something that utilizes known common laboratory techniques.  I still just want to start with some mitochondrial stripping experiments.

I've been playing AI Dungeon lately.  I think I had some thought about it that I was going to record here, but I forgot it while composing this post.  It's nearly midnight, so I'm going to go to bed rather than struggling to recover the lost bit of content.
