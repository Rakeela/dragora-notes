10:58.  I just finished scheduling The Fall of Foyis to publish on Furaffinity.  The final chapter will publish on the eighth of December, with publications every three days starting yesterday.

12:16.  Man, I always feel like I've played The Ascent for an age, and it keeps turning out to have been an hour.  My record marathon on that game is like two hours (ending when it crashed).  I don't schedule myself to limit my play, I just...  get sick of it again.  I'm getting on towards endgame encounters in the game.

12:29.  Whoa, was that thirteen minutes?  What have I been doing, just chatting?  Yeah?  I've just been chatting.

12:31.  817.

16:23.  I stopped work at around 15:20, and I reached 1,579 words.
