16:27.  Would you believe I got up at 4:03 this morning?  Today's been unproductive, but I want to train myself to sleep less.  I want to be able to force myself alert.  If I can get used to waking up early, and ACTUALLY waking up early without going back to sleep, I can scavenge more time out of the day.  When I spent five hours this morning playing Starfield, I felt pretty good about it.  I think I'll do that again tomorrow... IF I can get up early enough.  For now...  it is waaaay past time to get started on doing some editing.  The editing process is pretty demoralizing, and I want to be back to writing new content on the end of the file rather than tweaking the content I already have.

17:32.  I did some editing, and then I got distracted back into a game.  I've got a won state in LCS.  My unstoppable engine of background influence, with hundreds of artists and writers, has every issue pressing towards elite liberal status.  The problem is that the election gave me 59 Elite Liberal senators, when winning requires 60+.

17:45.  Credit 18 words.  It's hard to find things to change, so far.  This chapter is... not entirely satisfying?  But it's okay?  I can't put my claw on what's wrong with it.

Tomorrow I'll be back on my writing quota.  Finally!  I may write more tonight as well, but not right this moment.
