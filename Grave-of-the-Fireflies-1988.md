#Grave-of-the-Fireflies-1988

There's a scene in here where the older brother chases the little sister growling and going, "Rar, I'm a bear!"  Reminded me of my older sister doing the same thing to me.  I hated that and I hated her for doing it.  It ended up being traumatic to me, and the movie reminded me of that.  Major lost points.

It was interesting.  A story of a character who resorts to theft during wartime and a little girl who dies of hunger-related disease.
