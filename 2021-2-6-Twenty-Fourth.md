Based on my studying today, I think schizophrenia may be outright curable through the application of recent technological advances in medicine.  I'm still studying to define exactly what that cure would involve.  I have two prospective procedures, one of which is easier but sadly less probably useful, the other of which is nearer to being ready for documentation, but which would be expensive to implement at large scale.  Obviously, documenting a procedure is nowhere close to proving it, but I think it's still valuable.  Until I know what experiment I would want to run, a laboratory is nothing but a pile of peculiarly arranged and mostly-inert matter.

In a personal ambitions sense, I'd love to make a creditable breakthrough in schizophrenia treatment, because I believe that schizophrenia as a disorder is pinning back what would otherwise be good and desirable genes for human intelligence.  So I foresee success in this endeavor as something which would enable future technical advances through freeing what is currently an emotionally unstable, criminal, and/or otherwise useless population from what holds them back, and turning them into people who are ready, able, and grateful for modern technical skills retraining.  New productivity would be unleashed while reducing human stress levels, which is exactly the kind of thing that [[hedonology]] is all about achieving!

Achieving that would make it easier to recruit for founding a later transformative research corporation.  I suppose I shouldn't call it Lutra Labs anymore, as I wanted to...  eighteen years ago now?  Anyways, it's a fantasy, but I live on the fuel of ambitious fantasies.  Building a beverage company was only ever an idea for a stepping stone to my actual biotech research concepts, and I've got some increasingly good ideas for potentially profitable biotechnology work.  I still hope my xenomitochondria research might yield a next-gen biofuel crop with superior EROI, I'd like to see if something can be done to engineer superior cellular metabolism under microgravity conditions, and I've got this concept for using RNA vaccines to tackle mental illnesses...  Surely not all of this work, but if *any* of my ideas work out, I'll change history for the better.

P.S. Before I go to bed for the night, let's take a moment to consider the question of the flu.  To prevent a megaflu outbreak in future years, perhaps it would be a good idea to start looking for more highly conserved flu antibody targets and new methods of prepping the immune system *before* the high-susceptibility outbreak sets in...
