People expect being a [[dragon]] to be an impressive claim, a boast, a pinning of an archetype...  I just mean it autobiographically.  It is not itself a claim of virtue.  I hold my ethics for that purpose.  Yet nothing of my ethics says that it's evil to be a gluttonous pleasure-seeker, and so in my life I seek ways to harm-minimize that inclination.  I am a [[pacifist]].  I would have been a pacifist as a dragon in the lifetime preceding this one held I the belief that it were a survivable stance; in the lifetime before that one, I was a dragon as well, and quite certainly a pacifist.

I want to tear down this world with its harshnesses and hatreds to construct in its place a world of worlds where all inclinations can be met.  I call this concept Yggdrasil, owing the term not to mythology, but to the game Nobilis 2nd Edition, where the tree of worlds is one of the potential settings for the game.  There will be no need of war on Ygddrasil, which is not to say no war shall ever there arise, but rather who fights in Yggdrasil will fight only by their own will and desire without the right to encumber any dissident with the weight of their warfare.  In the many, many kinds of world upon the tree, there will be something there for anyone who searches, and perhaps anything that is searched for will be found.

I see this as a concept suitable for technological implementation.  Again, the concept is not mythological to me.  It is posthuman.  It is the ultimate reward of consciousness uploading if that technology can be implemented with security and honor.  It is not a plan for me, but a longing; I keep this lit as a torch, though had I myself to implement it, I cannot fathom how long it would take.  It would spend eons as a disappointing space.  It could only come together as a grand project of many people, but that would be perfect; they by their efforts would create a panoply of worlds, and the greatest of those would be remixed.

It may be fair to call it the vengeance that I seek against warriors, that I would besot them with pleasures amidst a soft eternity, but I think Yggdrasil's concept stands in violation of no rights.  It only stops people from fighting with each other nonconsensually.  Even there, I have played enough videogames that I do not imagine such a paradise for myself as wholly and forever nonviolent, much less for anyone without my pacifistic commitments; I would never implement Yggdrasil as an endless array of peaceful worlds.  Even I would find that dull!  So as I envision this, people may indeed still fight if they choose, and perhaps they'd learn in endless time to fight like demons truly.  Still I think it's very important that their only *prey* should be willing or fictional.

I want reality to be benevolent and consensual.

Someday I want a dragon's body, but I do not long for strength.  I long to lounge upon a plateau in a stormy place with a well-appointed cave behind me should I wish it... and a limitless virtual bag of candy at my side for me to munch on without consequence while I study or do other primarily mental tasks through the virtual interfaces of that realm.  Candy!  I have a tremendous sweet tooth.  There are many wondrous foods and even I can get sick of sweets, but I don't want to dwell in an everlasting banquet hall.  I'd get nothing else done.  I'm more interested in virtual snacks that won't take up so much of my attention that I'm stopped from working on other stuff while I eat.  At the very least I should always have new creative projects; in Yggdrasil, the need of art will be limitless.  I want to be an artist and a scholar, forever.
