People expect being a [[dragon]] to be an impressive claim, a boast, a pinning of an archetype...  I just mean it autobiographically.  It is not itself a claim of virtue.  I hold my ethics for that purpose.  Yet nothing of my ethics says that it's evil to be a gluttonous pleasure-seeker, and so in my life I seek ways to harm-minimize that inclination.  I am a [[pacifist]].  I would have been a pacifist as a dragon in the lifetime preceding this one held I the belief that it were a survivable stance; in the lifetime before that one, I was a dragon as well, and quite certainly a pacifist.

I want to tear down this world with its harshnesses and hatreds to construct in its place a world of worlds where all inclinations can be met.  I call this concept Yggdrasil, owing the term not to mythology, but to the game Nobilis 2nd Edition, where the tree of worlds is one of the potential settings for the game.  There will be no need of war on Ygddrasil, which is not to say no war shall ever there arise, but rather who fights in Yggdrasil will fight only by their own will and desire without the right to encumber any dissident with the weight of their warfare.  In the many, many kinds of world upon the tree, there will be something there for anyone who searches, and perhaps anything that is searched for will be found.

I see this as a concept suitable for technological implementation.  Again, the concept is not mythological to me.  It is posthuman.  It is the ultimate reward of consciousness uploading if that technology can be implemented with security and honor.  It is not a plan for me, but a longing; I keep this lit as a torch, though had I myself to implement it, I cannot fathom how long it would take.  It would spend eons as a disappointing space.  It could only come together as a grand project of many people, but that would be perfect; they by their efforts would create a panoply of worlds, and the greatest of those would be remixed.

It may be fair to call it the vengeance that I seek against warriors, that I would besot them with pleasures amidst a soft eternity, but I think Yggdrasil's concept stands in violation of no rights.  It only stops people from fighting with each other nonconsensually.  Even there, I have played enough videogames that I do not imagine such a paradise for myself as wholly and forever nonviolent, much less for anyone without my pacifistic commitments; I would never implement Yggdrasil as an endless array of peaceful worlds.  Even I would find that dull!  So as I envision this, people may indeed still fight if they choose, and perhaps they'd learn in endless time to fight like demons truly.  Still I think it's very important that their only *prey* should be willing or fictional.

I want reality to be benevolent and consensual.

Someday I want a dragon's body, but I do not long for strength.  I long to lounge upon a plateau in a stormy place with a well-appointed cave behind me should I wish it... and a limitless virtual bag of candy at my side for me to munch on without consequence while I study or do other primarily mental tasks through the virtual interfaces of that realm.  Candy!  I have a tremendous sweet tooth.  There are many wondrous foods and even I can get sick of sweets, but I don't want to dwell in an everlasting banquet hall.  I'd get nothing else done.  I'm more interested in virtual snacks that won't take up so much of my attention that I'm stopped from working on other stuff while I eat.  At the very least I should always have new creative projects; in Yggdrasil, the need of art will be limitless.  I want to be an artist and a scholar, forever.

My schedule is messed up again.  I've had lifelong trouble with insomnia, which has struck me again.  I get stressed out, and can't fathom sleeping...  There's a specific neural pattern that is the sleep induction state.  It's a twist on all my thoughts.  I can feel it pulling on my thoughts when I'm very sleepy, but I've almost never managed to shape my thoughts that way intentionally.  It generally doesn't happen when I'm stressed out.  My baseline stress carriage is always too high, and stressors can push me over the line of sleeplessness fairly easily.  These breakdowns in my schedule are not good for my engagement with anything.  My mood is usually terrible through the night, and when it does happen that I'm in a good mood while up all night, the subjective experience tends to have more in common with obsession than ordinary pleasure.

Lately I've been able to feel sad about it, to feel sorry for my future self; when I know I'm probably going to be awake during the hours I'd rather not be, I've been able to stress and worry about how I'm going to feel in upcoming hours.  Dreading to be awake all night feels like progress somehow.  It also feels like dread and stress, though it's not quite the same as the stress that makes me sleepless, somehow.  It feels more emotionally natural and adaptive.

Doing that essay on biotechnology for my college course has made me wonder if I strictly have to be class-dependent for work like that.  On the one hand, I can't adopt a task like that casually if I have much else to do.  It soaked hours and I did that voluntarily despite the difficulty it gave me with getting the rest of my coursework done in time (I managed).  On the other hand, I think I'm happier about the hours I spent on that than I am about most of the hours I've spent on most videogames.  Maybe drafting essays about my thoughts on medicine should be a new form of recreation for me.  I do voluntarily read research more than I have any obligation to.  I should be able to assemble other pieces of similar content if I choose.

I think there's potential scientific value in this.  I'm (still) a layperson (for now), but my scientific vocabulary is excellent.  I may be able to postulate explorable causalities.  Recreational biotechnology research review is likely to involve subject matter beyond the scope of my own ambitions, but that's fine.  That just means I have no reason to be territorial about it.  Kind of like the Yggdrasil concept I wrote about this morning, a lot of my medical technology hopes fall into the category of "longing".  If someone commercializes the wrong kind of beverage in the upcoming years, I get to say, "Darn, I was hoping to get that money myself," but there's no similar rivalrous factor for advances in immunology.

Medical thought rewards the more omnibenevolent attitude, too.  I look at useless and/or crazy people as a kind of... mishandled raw material.  They're people who suffer because society can't meet their needs, and all the suffering they inflict on others is because of the same thing.  I'm aware of the importance of fundamental economic limits and I understand that solving all problems is not physically possible on Earth within available resource constraints, but that drives a longing for new technologies.  I look towards medicine for that.

A news headline that I saw today stated that schizophrenia seems to be the highest COVID-19 risk factor after age, even controlling for more high-profile known risk factors such as diabetes and heart disease.  My first thought on this was based on my psychosocial expectations of schizophrenics, as I thought, "Oh, that makes sense.  Schizophrenics are hard to keep masked in quarantine.  They're prone to wandering in fear and confusion."  Yet the reporting on the issue struck me as surprisingly medically competent, and it didn't talk about the behavioral aspects of schizophrenia at all.  It instead focused on the connection between schizophrenia and the immune system.  Since reading it, I've been wondering if schizophrenia may be an immunological disorder of some kind.  Do neuroinflammatory processes contribute to the cognitive disregulation of schizophrenia?  If RNA vaccines can be used to adjust immune response profiles, do they have any potential applicability here?  I don't know the answers to these questions, but the work I would put into writing a short, well-cited essay exploring them would likely answer them for myself and others.

Schizophrenics are a good example of useless and/or crazy people who cost a lot of resources and don't get a lot of sympathy...  Writing something that focuses on possible novel treatments for them seems like it would be public-spirited, and I think I would find doing so highly hedonic as well.  I'm not committing to it yet, but since I'd enjoy it, I think it's likely that I will search for the hours to spend on that task.

Despite my basic gluttony, I also often wish I could turn off my sense of hunger.  That's another thing I'd do with my virtual paradise: I'd be hungry only when I wanted to be.  Hunger is sufficiently core hedonic engagement to me that I don't expect to turn it off THAT often if I can remove the side effects of over-eating, but I'd still turn it off sometimes.  In a pre-paradisic mode, it'd also make weight management easier.  I mean, not that I mind chowing down on the occasional bag of pork rinds as a source of keto-friendly food that comes in under my fasting target (400 calories), but just not getting hungry would work still better.

I wonder if I can draft my next class essay in my dragora archive, too.  It's a little bit trickier...  It says "two page essay" with font/margin/spacing requirements.  I wouldn't have a good sense of how much content I was producing if I drafted it here, where none of those requirements would be visible on the page.  Maybe I can at least take notes here?
