I am struggling to study.  I am not only struggling in trigonometry, but I am struggling to focus on studying it, as well.  I have dedicated my day to studying it and I don't think I have done enough.  I am convinced that I will do catastrophically upon the test that I am going to take tomorrow.

I am continuing to try new things to manage my condition.  I have added what Kistaro tells me is an OTC immunosuppressant to my medications.  Fluticasone propionate may help.

I am only taking two classes.  Math study eats up all of my time and so far is fruitless.  I wish I had the free time to continue studying my [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]] and [[notes-on-tolerogenic-dendritic-cells]] to perhaps produce essays in those domains.  That universal tolerogenesis serum, if it worked, would change history for the better.  It'd be a better treatment for overactivities in the immune system than anything currently available, and by being 'universal', it'd be cheap enough to deploy heavily.

I want to get a chance to try making it, but I truly need to be better at math to be involved in science.
