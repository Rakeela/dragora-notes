#What-Dreams-May-Come-1998

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I'd forgotten about this one, but now that I've remembered it, I remember that I really liked it.  Themes of Heaven and Hell, treated with appropriate dignity, are very appealing to me.  I think I should watch it again sometime.
