7:18.  Creating a first timepoint for the day.  I haven't done anything besides get dressed and eat a chocolate bar.  Has it been nearly half an hour since I got out of bed?  How?  Sometimes time flows in a comprehensible manner and sometimes, especially in the morning, it does not.  I didn't even finish the chocolate bar.

18:39.  OMG I have done nothing productive all day.  I read a little bit of a book?  Only one book, and not a lot of it?  I have otherwise spent today sleeping or eating.

19:02.  Actually, that's not fair.  I also took a bag of trash off the street today.  I litter-picked.

19:33.  83,759.  I can edit at least one chapter tonight.  83,768.    Credit 9 words.
