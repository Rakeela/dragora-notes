#Simplified-Guide-to-Aeroponics-Tower-Gardening

I bought a handful of aeroponics guides, and this is the one I read first.  It's by Benjamin Cole, and it could really use an editor.  It does give the impression that aeroponic gardening is pretty simple, and lead to my acquiring a few items I hadn't already prepared.

This guide strikes me as optimistic and encouraging.  It also strikes me as simplistic and incomplete, but that befits its title as a simplified guide.  I think this guide would be enough to get started with.

Although I called its tone optimistic, this book also ends with a section on potential future global food shortage issues.  The author exhorts people to look to indoor vertical farming as a means of condensing food production to scale up to meet the needs of more people.  I intend to heed such calls myself.
