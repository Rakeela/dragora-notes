#Lost-Eons-Lands-of-Iron

Too ridiculous for my tastes, though it tightens up some of the rules in the intro.  Eliminates the Outcast, Psych, and Shifter archetypes.  Reduces mutational load by eliminating most mutations from spellcasting and replaces detrimental mutations with a rule that mutations are beneficial to skill development.

Most of the book is the bizarre, comical setting that it proposes.  Too much focus on the college taken over by animals, IMO.  I wouldn't want to play with the setting, but it was quite a thing to read.  Recommended for bizarrity.
