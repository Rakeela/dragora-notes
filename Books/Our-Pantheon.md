#Our-Pantheon

Subtitled "a Dawn Of Worlds hack by D. W. O'Boyle" and "Alpha V2 - December 2019"

This is a set of rules for a game of creative collaboration where each player plays a God and the group creates a map together with biomes and civilizations on it.

It looks like it'd be a fun way for me to feel an actual connection with other people.  I tend to forget anyone who I haven't creatively collaborated with.  I remember creative projects longer than I remember people... if the memory of a creative project is associated with my memory of a person, the memories of that person become affixed in my mind.
