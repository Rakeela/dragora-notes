#Royal-Red

This would be my present favorite book if not for the [[Gryphon-Insurrection]] series taking up the favorite slot.  (I consider them collectively to be one favorite.)

I keep Royal Red on my desk and I intend to use it for inspiration in my next writing, but I'm feeling stymied right now (2022-10-30) and I can't really describe it at length yet.  I just had to say that I love it.
