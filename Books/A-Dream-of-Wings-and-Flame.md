#A-Dream-of-Wings-and-Flame

In which a kobold named Sam - whose full name I have already forgotten - develops draconic ambition and turns his back scornfully on the rest of the warren.  Good descriptions of magic in use.  It develops a setting rich in magic, but where learning magic often kills ambitious practitioners due to the practice called 'baptisms'.

There's a sequel.  I should read it at some point.
