#The-Forever-King-by-Ben-Galley

This book was rude!  The author seemeed at points obsessed with referring to shit.  An implausibly long quote is at one point attributed to being scrawled in manure on the palace of the Big Bad.  Nobody would do that.  Worse, the people were rude to each other in ways that eroded my belief in their relationships to one another.  The book seemed to be trying to present the society of people who were both nice and rude.

It also contained some editing mistakes.  I think at least nine of them were in there, most exaggeratedly being the one where a description of a character (I think it was Ko'Tergo?) is straight-up repeated.  The last error I noticed in the book is on page 653, where a warship is described as being *spliced* in two.  That was almost certainly supposed to be *sliced* in two.  It comes off as an error of editing-by-spellcheck.

Predictably, I appreciated the characters of the dragons more than I appreciated the characters of the humans, though there were two(?) points where it seemed like Fleetstar (the Mad Dragon, who is the rudest of the dragons) was erroneously assigned male pronouns.  There may also have been an error where Shivertread was described as the only dragon who changed colors, when I could swear that Fleetstar had changed colors for stealth during the infiltration of Krauslung's port.

So much happened in this book that I have difficulty remembering all of the details.  It clearly would tolerate re-reading without being immediately exhausted.  That's a good trait.  I just wish it had been re-read by an editor.

Overall, this book was a disappointment, but I still enjoyed it.  I may buy the sequel.
