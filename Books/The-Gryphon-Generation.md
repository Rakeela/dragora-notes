#The-Gryphon-Generation

Book one of a series of which I've only read the first book.  I own more of the series now, but it's been long enough since I read it that I'm rereading it.  I have a rare special edition of the first book, but I'm shy about specifying what's rare about it.  I'll come back to this eventually, probably.
