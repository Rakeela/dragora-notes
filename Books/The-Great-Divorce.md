I rather think I would climb the mountain without yielding that it is wrong of God to expect belief-by-faith-alone.  If that meant I stayed a ghost, I would do so while exhausted and complaining of the pain of the endeavor.  Yet all the exercise I have ever taken was while exhausted and complaining of the pain of the endeavor!

I have read this novel summarized as being a tale whereby the gates of hell are locked from the inside.  I agree, to a point.  I think it contains an injustice.  The ghost who defends the courage of his convictions seems to be ill-treated by the one who argues for 'narrowness' and the belief in *nothing*.  For that is what 'faith' is: the resounding belief in nothing at all.  I would rate it among the nihilisms and I am dismayed at the idea that a grand omnipotence would favor it.

As a child, I held that science was the truest worship of God, for scientists take joy in all of creation and can enjoy countless things that other people cannot enjoy.  Science is the belief in *something*, and a virtuous God should reward the belief in something, which belief should be rightly founded: upon test and rigor, to create a foundation true and solid.

Faith as a foundation is an unworthy phantom.  I wouldn't have liked this book well as a child, I think, for it condemns a guy who I as a child would have believed in very much and longed dearly to meet.

In this setting, I expect that I should be fine, for I would at least be seeking God, and that is given in this book as the true requirement.  That would be the mustard seed of faith.

How ironic, then!  An atheist who would rather believe in God, even on such a searching sliver, would do better than all the souls C.S. Lewis gives to the story.

The book does give an example of a ghost making their way all the way up the mountain.  One Sir Archibald manages to make the great trek as a phantom, for "no power in the universe" would have stopped him from staying and going up the mountain.  What a dismal showing Heaven must have made, if it could not keep someone who loved knowledge!

What an astonishing idea that is, the researcher who dies and goes to the valley of life, then climbs the mountain to Heaven, and who having seen it is then wont to choose Hell.  For if time is the strange thing it is in this story, then when 'damnation reaches back' it should prove that all that researcher saw were provinces in Hell.

In defense of C.S. Lewis on the matter of the fellow who defends the courage of his convictions, I would note one last thing about *his* story: he is described as wearing gaiters (good, stout boots) and as finding "the grey town" to be near-to-paradise.  He is described as having lost the thirst for reason.  I don't find him so!  The mention of Happiness is meanwhile itself what sends him back down to the bus.  It is as though he has a measure of joy about him even in Hell.  So perhaps that character is one who takes the bus in both directions a few times, trying to ennoble the souls in the dim Purgatory and harden his feet in the bright Purgatory.

There's another heroic shade in the book.  The one who tries to steal an apple and gets castigated by a waterfall-angel, but who persists in stealing it...  His motive is to promote community in purgatory and bring people around each other!  So it's like he's solid enough, more solid than the narrator of the story, to pick up and carry an entire apple.  The waterfall-angel says there's no room in hell for the apple, but still he carries it off.

I think it's because of his community-minded motive.  He talks of greed and of establishing a business of some kind handling things more solid than the ephemera of the structures in hell, but he also bemoans that the people in hell move apart from each other.  I think this other-oriented desire base makes him considered more solid than the others and nearer to paradise.

Yet he hides from the angels and works to steal something solid back to hell...  What a strange character.
