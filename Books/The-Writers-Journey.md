#The-Writers-Journey

By Christopher Vogler.  I picked this up at my campus bookstore.  It's a textbook for a course I'm deeply unlikely to take.  I read it anyways, hoping for some insight.  I'm not a big fan of The Hero's Journey, and this guy's commentary on The Lion King made me feel like he just doesn't get stories which don't match his flow.  I'm sure the book is very insightful for people who aren't me, but I did read it.
