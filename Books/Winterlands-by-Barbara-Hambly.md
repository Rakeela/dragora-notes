#Winterlands-by-Barbara-Hambly

The first book in this series, "Dragonsbane" is (if I remember correctly) the only dragon transformation exposure I had in a human childhood.  I thought the protagonist was completely wrong to reject the dragon transformation; I thought she was wrong to prefer a human over Morkeleb.
