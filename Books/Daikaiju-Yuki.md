#Daikaiju-Yuki

I loved this.  I wish I could've edited it before it published.  I counted 18 errors in the text, starting on page 6, or 20 errors if two counts of mispronouning Alkanoth are included.

The idea of a kaiju ibis (Alkanoth) was very unexpected.  The fast lizard kaiju described as sailing on his frill seemed very silly.  I confess I imagined him on a surfboard.
