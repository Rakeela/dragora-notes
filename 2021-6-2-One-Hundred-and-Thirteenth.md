I was reading a news article today decrying a "drug den" in a nearby city, and the opening of it surprised me.  The article starts with a quote from a local resident saying that there have been drug dealers operating there for forty years... and until recently, they were tolerable, because they were mostly dealing marijuana.

The concept of some such tolerance in society is precious to me.  I'm glad I can live in an area that has a concept of a threshold of acceptable drug trafficking.  I value legalizations as a way to deal with the crime and siphoning of resources to atrocious organizations which occurs as a result of drug addiction.  I'd love to see the issue drop from relevance.  If a local drug community can exist without being highly disruptive, that's wonderful.

I think the idea of "a tolerable drug den" says a lot about marijuana legalization.  I think that marijuana legalization occurred in part because of two things.  Firstly, there were a very large number of youth whose *only* illegal activity was cannabis usage.  Secondly, there arose some number of communities where the local dealers and stoners were seen as... members of the community!  There were communities that didn't *want* the police to round up the local petty drug traffic.

If other drugs can move into that niche, they can follow a similar trajectory.  I wonder if it can happen.  That would require building enough of a community that people don't ditch syringes in the garden, so to speak.  There are some dogmatic communities where there's no such thing as the right way to do a wrong thing, but in more liberal environs the wrong thing can be done less wrong.
