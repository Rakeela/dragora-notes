#2021-6-2-One-Hundred-and-Thirteenth 

I was reading a news article today decrying a "drug den" in a nearby city, and the opening of it surprised me.  The article starts with a quote from a local resident saying that there have been drug dealers operating there for forty years... and until recently, they were tolerable, because they were mostly dealing marijuana.

The concept of some such tolerance in society is precious to me.  I'm glad I can live in an area that has a concept of a threshold of acceptable drug trafficking.  I value legalizations as a way to deal with the crime and siphoning of resources to atrocious organizations which occurs as a result of drug addiction.  I'd love to see the issue drop from relevance.  If a local drug community can exist without being highly disruptive, that's wonderful.

I think the idea of "a tolerable drug den" says a lot about marijuana legalization.  I think that marijuana legalization occurred in part because of two things.  Firstly, there were a very large number of youth whose *only* illegal activity was cannabis usage.  Secondly, there arose some number of communities where the local dealers and stoners were seen as... members of the community!  There were communities that didn't *want* the police to round up the local petty drug traffic.

If other drugs can move into that niche, they can follow a similar trajectory.  I wonder if it can happen.  That would require building enough of a community that people don't ditch syringes in the garden, so to speak.  There are some dogmatic communities where there's no such thing as the right way to do a wrong thing, but in more liberal environs the wrong thing can be done less wrong

Extensive efforts were made to violate my privacy, and it's just kind of dumb.  If I hide something, I can't talk about it.  If I can't talk about something, what's the point in doing it?  So I don't hide things.  That way I can talk about anything.

Like earlier today.  I took a few small, ineffectual steps towards creating a nuzzle engine for simulating Swaivshon interacting affectionately.  My current design involves a few attitude states and a list of nuzzleable bodyparts.  *This* isn't something I would conventionally have to hide.

Yet I got there by looking at "My Very Own Lith", a cute game set in a blank void.  It's got a much better interface and frankly better writing than I'm capable of.  I needed the reassurance that setting up a blank test environment was 'okay'.  This part *is* something I would conventionally need to hide.

While looking at *that*, I saw that the same developer has also made "Project Wild One".  Playing this game is *deeply* something I would conventionally need to hide.  Project Wild One is a shockingly antiromantic game which stands as a testament to... antisexuality, bluntly.  It's solidly anti-tenderness, and the gameplay exists in a bizarre hell with no love and no ordinary pleasures.  Some undescribed wilderness where without sex there would *be* no pleasure; where no hunger exists save sexual hunger, and the satisfaction of sexuality mixes with the satisfaction of bloodshed in a strange way.  Who would wish to visit such a place?

It made me feel like I understand something about the vore fetish.  Is the desire to make such software like the desire to victimize and kill people by sexually abusing them?  Vore is not part of romance.  It's more like the crass fixation which people are believed to have in "love" of porn games, and which is used to prove that people deserve to be hated for having no sense of romance.  The porn game "eats" its viewer, wasting their life, and hurting them in the name of pleasure.  Hurting them potentially rather badly; the whole taboo against mentioning porn games is built on how injurious porn games are believed to be!

Vore seems to embody the desire to ruin liberal sexuality by degrading it, and not only degrading it, but literally consuming it!  Proving that liberals have no capacity of love and eating them!  It strikes me as very excellent fascism!  I'm surprised conservatives aren't into it.  AFAIK they prefer the "cuckoldry" fetish as a means to express that drive; they do use "cuckoldry" that way, degrading liberal sexuality by promoting something anticharismatic.  They'll use anything that way a little bit, lashing out by false affection, like when a thread on 4chan today claimed to be pro-bestiality in a transparently dishonest way.  It's a terrible commentary on how anti-honest our society has gotten.

Mind you that despite this review, I've also seen cute vore; it's still not my thing, but Resurrection Bloom exists and is worth a glance.  That's here: https://axiakita.itch.io/rezbloom.  I've seen high-tech vore settings that are also clearly meant to be harmless/facilitative; Mel was into that, and as I cannot count it among his faults, I regret not appreciating it more.

Since modern political thinkers successfully installed an honesty taboo, nobody is allowed to notice that anything is unpleasant, heh.  But I disagree with that, too.  I'm not denigrating Project Wild One by noticing any of this.  I think it's artistically promising.  These are the things that it strikes me as 'about', and my read is not authoritative.  It could mean other things to other people.

Posting this stuff is fundamentally sexual exhibitionism.  It was my first fetish.  I didn't want to have a sex life that I couldn't talk about or share around.  The thing is, this kind of sharing was *supposed* to be voluntary.  I got stalked by a rape cult who made it involuntary.  They didn't care about my consent.  Involuntary exhibitionism just isn't the same sex act as voluntary exhibitionism.

People DO use porn games to prove that other people deserve to be hated.  It happened to me personally.  I was supposed to provide cybersexual services to people or else, then I was supposed to program porn games or else, then I was supposed to submit to a reputation for sexual desperation when I... refused to provide sexual services.  I was hated for playing porn games, something I only did because I was trying to obey the 'or else' rules on my life.

There's nothing liberal about that.
