(Commentary:  I need a supply of loose paper in my backpack, and I wonder if there is anywhere on campus to acquire it.)

(Commentary:  The upcoming molecular models lab on Friday includes "draw a 3D sketch" of the molecular models as part of its instructions.  Even this simplest sketching task will be a major difficulty for me.  I cannot draw at all.  These will be very sketchy sketches.)

If you add bromine to an alkane, the red color of bromine persists.  If you add bromine to an alkene or alkyne, the red color of bromine disappears immediately.  This is because the alkene or alkyne becomes brominated into a haloalkane.

In hydration, an alkene reacts with water, H-OH to form an alcohol.  An -H atom bonds to one C in the C=C bond.  The -OH bonds with the other C in the C=C bond.  For example, ethene becomes ethanol (ethyl alcohol).  These reactions are catalyzed by strong acids such as H2SO4.

(Commentary:  I can use - to represent single bonds and = to represent double bonds, but I don't have anything on this keyboard to represent triple bonds.)

When H2O adds to a double bond in an asymmetrical alkene, two products are possible.  But Markovnikov's rule states that: when hydration occurs with a double bond that has an unequal number of H atoms, the -H atom bonds to the C in the C=C bond that has *more H*, while the -OH bonds to the C in the C=C bond that has *fewer H* atoms.  The example given is that propene hydrates into 2-propanol.

(Commentary:  Oops.  I have just yawned in class behind the teacher's back.  This has left me embarrassed to be wearing no mask, so I need to dig one of the spare masks out of my backpack.  I had forgotten they were there.  This mask mandate is outdated, but it does make yawning more subtle.)

In hydrohalogenation, the atoms of a hydrogen halide add to the carbon atoms of a double bond or triple bond.  The example given is alkene become alkyl halide, a haloalkane.

(Commentary:  Ow!  My arms!  I need potassium, but I don't want to take it in class.  While I'm talking about pain, ow my right ear.  That's not a potassium-linked pain, that comes from intermedius nervus neuralgia, as I discussed in [[2022-02-02-Two-Hundred-and-Twenty-Sixth]].  I wish I weren't being distracted by pains.)

When an unsymmetrical alkene undergoes hydrohalogenation, the H in HX adds to (Didn't finish this in time, loading the e-text to see if I can.  Aaand I can't.  It says the courseware isn't available yet as the instructor hasn't enabled it, but I can access it at home.  I'll have to either infer the rule from the current class exercise, or else I'll have to correct this once I get home.  Watch me forget.)

Polymers are large, long-chain molecules.  They are found in nature, including cellulose in plants, starches in food, and proteins and DNA in the body.  DNA is a polymer of nucleic acid.  They are also made synthetically, such as polyethylene and polystyrene, Teflon, and nylon.  It's made of small repeating units called monomers.  They're made by addition reaction of small alkenes.

In polymerization, small repeating units called monomers join to form a long chain polymer.  The example given is ethene (ethylene) monomers joining to become a polyethylene section.  Many polymerization reactions require high temperature, a catalyst, and high pressure (over 1000 atmospheres).

Common synthetic polymers include polyethylene (used for beverage bottles), polyvinyl chloride (used for garden hoses), polypropylene (used for fabric), polytetrafluoroethylene (aka Teflon coatings), polydichloroethylene (aka Saran wrap), and polystyrene (aka styrofoam).  (There was another one of these given, but I was a little behind in transcribing all of it.  I don't think I need these chemicals much.)

A polymer may contain as many as 1000 monomers.  Polyethylene, a polymer made from ethylene H2C=CH2 monomers, is used in plastic bottles, film, and plastic dinnerware.  Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is flexible, breakable, less dense, and bmore branched than high-density polyethylene (HDPE).  High-density polyethylene is stronger and more dense than LDPE, and it melts at a higher temperature.

Polyethylene has the chemical structure of an alkane, with CH bonds repeating indefinitely.  Polyvinyl chloride alternates Chloride atoms and Hydrogen atoms along one side of the chain.  Polypropylene alternates methyl groups every other carbon along one side of the chain.

(Commentary:  This stuff is interesting, but I bet it won't be on the test.)

Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) uses fluoride connections instead of hydrogen.   It's made from the monomer tetrafluoroethylene.  Polydichloroethylene alternates chloride and hydrogen atoms all along the length of the change.  Polystyrene is made from phylethene monomers.  Every other carbon has a benzene ring attached to it.

(Commentary:  Oops.  Study check just asked what the monomer used to make Teflon is.  I haven't been recording monomers for most of these.  I wish I had access to the textbook.  I have the physical copy at home; I may need to reorganize my backpack and start carrying the textbook physically to class.  I think I should.)

(Commentary:  I'm intimidated by Teflon's molecular structure.  Isn't fluorine extremely reactive?  Yet Teflon is so inert!  It has so many fluorine atoms and it just sits there.)
