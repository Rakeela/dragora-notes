(Commentary:  I need a supply of loose paper in my backpack, and I wonder if there is anywhere on campus to acquire it.)

(Commentary:  The upcoming molecular models lab on Friday includes "draw a 3D sketch" of the molecular models as part of its instructions.  Even this simplest sketching task will be a major difficulty for me.  I cannot draw at all.  These will be very sketchy sketches.)

If you add bromine to an alkane, the red color of bromine persists.  If you add bromine to an alkene or alkyne, the red color of bromine disappears immediately.  This is because the alkene or alkyne becomes brominated into a haloalkane.

In hydration, an alkene reacts with water, H-OH to form an alcohol.  An -H atom bonds to one C in the C=C bond.  The -OH bonds with the other C in the C=C bond.  For example, ethene becomes ethanol (ethyl alcohol).  These reactions are catalyzed by strong acids such as H2SO4.

(Commentary:  I can use - to represent single bonds and = to represent double bonds, but I don't have anything on this keyboard to represent triple bonds.)

When H2O adds to a double bond in an asymmetrical alkene, two products are possible.  But Markovnikov's rule states that: when hydration occurs with a double bond that has an unequal number of H atoms, the -H atom bonds to the C in the C=C bond that has *more H*, while the -OH bonds to the C in the C=C bond that has *fewer H* atoms.  The example given is that propene hydrates into 2-propanol.

(Commentary:  Oops.  I have just yawned in class behind the teacher's back.  This has left me embarrassed to be wearing no mask, so I need to dig one of the spare masks out of my backpack.  I had forgotten they were there.  This mask mandate is outdated, but it does make yawning more subtle.)

In hydrohalogenation, the atoms of a hydrogen halide add to the carbon atoms of a double bond or triple bond.  The example given is alkene become alkyl halide, a haloalkane.

(Commentary:  Ow!  My arms!  I need potassium, but I don't want to take it in class.  While I'm talking about pain, ow my right ear.  That's not a potassium-linked pain, that comes from intermedius nervus neuralgia, as I discussed in [[2022-02-02-Two-Hundred-and-Twenty-Sixth]].  I wish I weren't being distracted by pains.)

When an unsymmetrical alkene undergoes hydrohalogenation, the H in HX adds to (Didn't finish this in time, loading the e-text to see if I can.  Aaand I can't.  It says the courseware isn't available yet as the instructor hasn't enabled it, but I can access it at home.  I'll have to either infer the rule from the current class exercise, or else I'll have to correct this once I get home.  Watch me forget.)

Polymers are large, long-chain molecules.  They are found in nature, including cellulose in plants, starches in food, and proteins and DNA in the body.  DNA is a polymer of nucleic acid.  They are also made synthetically, such as polyethylene and polystyrene, Teflon, and nylon.  It's made of small repeating units called monomers.  They're made by addition reaction of small alkenes.

In polymerization, small repeating units called monomers join to form a long chain polymer.  The example given is ethene (ethylene) monomers joining to become a polyethylene section.  Many polymerization reactions require high temperature, a catalyst, and high pressure (over 1000 atmospheres).

Common synthetic polymers include polyethylene (used for beverage bottles), polyvinyl chloride (used for garden hoses), polypropylene (used for fabric), polytetrafluoroethylene (aka Teflon coatings), polydichloroethylene (aka Saran wrap), and polystyrene (aka styrofoam).  (There was another one of these given, but I was a little behind in transcribing all of it.  I don't think I need these chemicals much.)

A polymer may contain as many as 1000 monomers.  Polyethylene, a polymer made from ethylene H2C=CH2 monomers, is used in plastic bottles, film, and plastic dinnerware.  Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is flexible, breakable, less dense, and bmore branched than high-density polyethylene (HDPE).  High-density polyethylene is stronger and more dense than LDPE, and it melts at a higher temperature.

Polyethylene has the chemical structure of an alkane, with CH bonds repeating indefinitely.  Polyvinyl chloride alternates Chloride atoms and Hydrogen atoms along one side of the chain.  Polypropylene alternates methyl groups every other carbon along one side of the chain.

(Commentary:  This stuff is interesting, but I bet it won't be on the test.)

Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) uses fluoride connections instead of hydrogen.   It's made from the monomer tetrafluoroethylene.  Polydichloroethylene alternates chloride and hydrogen atoms all along the length of the change.  Polystyrene is made from phylethene monomers.  Every other carbon has a benzene ring attached to it.

(Commentary:  Oops.  Study check just asked what the monomer used to make Teflon is.  I haven't been recording monomers for most of these.  I wish I had access to the textbook.  I have the physical copy at home; I may need to reorganize my backpack and start carrying the textbook physically to class.  I think I should.)

(Commentary:  I'm intimidated by Teflon's molecular structure.  Isn't fluorine extremely reactive?  Yet Teflon is so inert!  It has so many fluorine atoms and it just sits there.)

The poly-x version of a polymer's name reveals the monomer of that polymer.  The monomer of polytetrafluorethene (Teflon) is tetrafluoroethene.

The alkane-like nature of these plastic synthetic polymers makes them unreactive.  They do not decompose easily.  They are not biodegradable.  They have become significant contributors to pollution on land and in the oceans.  Efforts are being made to make them more degradable.

Recycling is simplified by using codes found on plastic items.  Code 1 is PETE (polyethylene terephtalate).   Code 2 is HDPE.  Code 3 is PVC (polyvinyl chloride).  Code 4 is LDPE.  Code 5 is PP (polypropylene).  Code 6 is PS (polystyrene).  Code 7 is O (other).

(Commentary:  I really appreciate the low stress levels so far in this intro to organic chemistry class.)

Aromatic Compounds - In 1825, Michael Faraday isolated a hydrocarbon called benzene, which consists of a six-carbon ring with alternating double bonds and the molecular formula C6H6.  (A space-filling model for benzene was displayed.)

Benzene is an aromatic compound.  It's a flat ring of six C atoms, each bonded to one H atom.  The bonds in benzene are unique one-and-a-half bonds.  The 6 electrons are shared equally among the 6 C atoms.  It is represented by a line-angle structural formula using a circle inside of a hexagon.

(Commentary: I'm skeptical of that line "The 6 electrons are shared equally among the 6 atoms," as there should be more than 6 shared electrons if 6 atoms have one-and-a-half bonds.  That should be 50% more, aka 9 electrons.  Yet "the 6 electrons" was the phrase in the slide, so I copied it.)

Aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring and a single substituent are named as benzene derivatives.  Since the ring contains only one substituent, the ring is not numbered.  Some common names such as toluene, aniline, and phenol are allowed by IUPAC rules.  A methyl substituent yields toluene, which would be methylbenzene.  An NH2 group (amino) yields aniline, which would be aminobenzene.  A hydroxyl group (OH) yields phenol, which would be hydroxybenzene.

When a benzene ring is a substituent, -C6H5 it is named as a phenyl group.  (The example is given of 3-Phenyl-1-butene

When there are two or more substituents, the benzene ring is numbered to give the lowest numbers to the substituents.  Further, there are ortho, meta, and para variants in benzene, which correspond to 1,2 substituents (o-), 1,3 substituents (m-), and 1-4 substituents (p-).  (The examples are given of o-dichlorobenzene or 1,2-dichlorobenzene, m-dichlorobenzene or 1,3-dichlorobenzene, and p-dichlorobenzene or 1,4-dichlorobenzene.). The 1,X nomenclature is IUPAC, but the o-, m-, and p- version is the common nomenclature that was invented first.

When a common name such as toluene, phenol, or aniline can be used, the carbon atom attached to the methyl, hydroxyl, or amine group is numbered as carbon 1.  Prefixes are used to show the position of the subsituents.  (The examples are given of 3-bromoaniline, 4-ethyltoluene, and 4-methylaniline, which is also 4-aminotoluene.)

The common name xylene is used for the isomers of dimethylbenzene.  (The examples are given of 1,2-dimethylbenzene, which is o-xylene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene, which is m-xylene, and 1,4-dimethylbenzene, which is p-xylene.)

If three or more substitutents are attached to the benzene ring, they are numbered in the direction to give the lowest set of numbers and then named alphabetically.

Toluene is used as a reactant to make drugs, dyes, and explosives such as TNT (trinitrotoluene).  (A chemical diagram is given showing the structure of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, which is TNT.)

The benzene ring is also found in some amino acids (which are the building blocks of proteins).  (The example is given of phenylalanine, but I didn't get the name copied in time.  I'm not sure of the name I assigned it either.)

The benzene ring is found in pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen; and in flavorings such as vanillin.  (Various examples which were analyzed by the class for their functional groups, but I was not on top of this activity and did not get it recorded.)

The flat, symmetrical structure of benzene allows for interactions between the cyclic structures, which contributes to the higher melting points and boiling points of benzene and its derivatives.

Hexane -95C
Benzene 6C
o-xylene -26C
m-xylene -46C (may have been recorded inaccurately)
p-xyelene (not recorded)

(Commentary:  Recording tables before the teacher moves on is difficult again and again...  I need the book open to do this right.)

Aromatic compounds are less dense than water, although they are usually more dense than other hydrocarbons.  Halogenated benzene compounds are denser than water.  Aromatic hydrocarbons are insoluble in water and are used as solvents for other organic compounds.  Only aromatic compounds containing strongly polar functional groups such as -OH or -COOH will be somewhat soluble in water.  Benzene and other aromatic compounds are resistant to reactions that break up the aromatic system, although they are flammable.

Aromatic compounds have a very stable aromatic bonding system.  They are resistant to many reactions.  They undergo substitution reactions, which retain the stability of the aromatic bonding system.  In a substitution reaction, a hydrogen atom on a benzene ring is replaced by an atom or group of atom.

Types of substitution:
1) Halogenation -CL or -Br
2) Nitrogenation (not recorded)
3) (not recorded)

(Commentary: Yet another table copying task where I fell behind.)
