(Commentary:  I need a supply of loose paper in my backpack, and I wonder if there is anywhere on campus to acquire it.)

(Commentary:  The upcoming molecular models lab on Friday includes "draw a 3D sketch" of the molecular models as part of its instructions.  Even this simplest sketching task will be a major difficulty for me.  I cannot draw at all.  These will be very sketchy sketches.)

If you add bromine to an alkane, the red color of bromine persists.  If you add bromine to an alkene or alkyne, the red color of bromine disappears immediately.  This is because the alkene or alkyne becomes brominated into a haloalkane.

In hydration, an alkene reacts with water, H-OH to form an alcohol.  An -H atom bonds to one C in the C=C bond.  The -OH bonds with the other C in the C=C bond.  For example, ethene becomes ethanol (ethyl alcohol).  These reactions are catalyzed by strong acids such as H2SO4.

(Commentary:  I can use - to represent single bonds and = to represent double bonds, but I don't have anything on this keyboard to represent triple bonds.)

When H2O adds to a double bond in an asymmetrical alkene, two products are possible.  But Markovnikov's rule states that: when hydration occurs with a double bond that has an unequal number of H atoms, the -H atom bonds to the C in the C=C bond that has *more H*, while the -OH bonds to the C in the C=C bond that has *fewer H* atoms.  The example given is that propene hydrates into 2-propanol.

(Commentary:  Oops.  I have just yawned in class behind the teacher's back.  This has left me embarrassed to be wearing no mask, so I need to dig one of the spare masks out of my backpack.  I had forgotten they were there.  This mask mandate is outdated, but it does make yawning more subtle.)

In hydrohalogenation, the atoms of a hydrogen halide add to the carbon atoms of a double bond or triple bond.  The example given is alkene become alkyl halide, a haloalkane.

(Commentary:  Ow!  My arms!  I need potassium, but I don't want to take it in class.  While I'm talking about pain, ow my right ear.  That's not a potassium-linked pain, that comes from intermedius nervus neuralgia, as I discussed in [[2022-02-02-Two-Hundred-and-Twenty-Sixth]].  I wish I weren't being distracted by pains.)

When an unsymmetrical alkene undergoes hydrohalogenation, the H in HX adds to (Didn't finish this in time, loading the e-text to see if I can.)
