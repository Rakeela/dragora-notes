One of the things I'm grateful for on Earth relative to the world of my origin is that the food quality is much better here than it was.  I still would like to go home if I could, or to some other world of dragons.  Yet in that lifetime, I ate mostly venison, and I considered mutton a special treat.  I cared for the health of the deer herds; this was work I did consciously, willfully, but resentfully.  There are so many delicious things on Earth that weren't on that world at all.
