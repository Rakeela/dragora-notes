#Library-of-Ruina

I only played a few minutes of this, but it still stood out.  It was beautiful yet grotesque.  It made me feel sick.  You play the game, turning the people who visit the eponymous library into books.  They're lured in by promises of power, only to be then added to the collection.

I only played through the first battle.  That first encounter establishes before you start it that you're fighting murderers.  That overcame my reluctance.  The second encounter in the story... didn't establish that it was against murderers.  I suspect it *probably* was.  It seems like *that kind of setting*... but I wasn't willing to try it.

Games 'make' their players do horrible things, but you can always turn the game off.  So I turned off Library of Ruina...  Still, it impressed me.
