10:33.  I spent hours napping on the couch, wallowing in comfort rather than immediately starting my day.

10:39.  33,885.  33,940.  I don't have good ideas right now and I haven't started on my morning stuff.  Also no I didn't do that initial pair of numbers in one minute, I forgot to record when I started.

15:12.  I played too much Liberal Crime Squad again.  I've been prepping a group to do implants.

17:22.  I played more LCS.  I got distracted from implant-prepping by cheating to avoid the intelligence services, who I angered by publishing secret documents.  I also fed two of my prostitutes into the criminal justice system.  I want to play 'properly' against the intelligence services in the game, but I haven't mastered that strategy.  There aren't enough safehouses.

18:22.  I'm trying to get back into writing and I still feel like I don't have ideas.  I talked through what the next chapter has to be with Kistaro, and...  like, I can understand and think about my objectives... but I feel like I need *flavour*.

21:50.  35,020.  1,135 words of progress.  Maybe I'll make quota today despite only getting to work late in the evening.

23:08.  36,366.  2,502 words on the chapter.  2,481 words of progress.

23:54.  37,137.  3,197 words of progress.
