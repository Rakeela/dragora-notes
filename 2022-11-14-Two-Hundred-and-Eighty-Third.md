Struggled on the chem test.  Hopefully I did well.  I didn't have to abandon too many questions, in the end.  Today's chemistry lesson is stuff I think I understand already.  Maybe the final will be easy.  Maybe I won't take it.  I believe the rule is that the lowest exam grade is dropped.  If my exams are all satisfactory, the final can be skipped, because it's just another exam.  It's an opportunity to replace a bad exam grade.  That's how this semester of chemistry is being graded.

That file at 3,977 is satisfactory, so I'm starting a new day on a new file.  Should be straightforward to see how far I am from quota today!

While trying to search-replace to eradicate erroneous uses of the word "people" (all such references should be to "dragons"), I accidentally blatted out some of the instances of "people" without successfully replacing them with anything.  My document has a bunch of little holes in it now and is down a few words.  I'm not going to account for the loss in today's wordcount estimates.

1,135 words.  532 words to go.

1,423 words.  244 words to go.  Ugh.

1,676 words.  9 words over.  Disappointing to stop so close to par, but it'll count.

My computer entered in a CTRL event while I was looking at the World Anvil page with my hands off the keys...  Why does my keyboard misbehave?  I got a cluster of bad input events just then.  A great swathe of the page ended up highlighted for no obvious reason.
