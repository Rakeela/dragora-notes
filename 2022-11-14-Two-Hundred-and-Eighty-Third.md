Struggled on the chem test.  Hopefully I did well.  I didn't have to abandon too many questions, in the end.  Today's chemistry lesson is stuff I think I understand already.  Maybe the final will be easy.  Maybe I won't take it.  I believe the rule is that the lowest exam grade is dropped.  If my exams are all satisfactory, the final can be skipped, because it's just another exam.  It's an opportunity to replace a bad exam grade.  That's how this semester of chemistry is being graded.
