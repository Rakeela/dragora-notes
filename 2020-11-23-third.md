I'm medically autodidactic.  I have weird medical issues and I've never caught the attention of a doctor with quite enough of an attention span to figure out what's wrong with me.  I've only managed to get enough information out of the medical profession to be informed that, indeed, something is wrong with me, and it's not easily classified into known syndromes.  So yay, medical mystery, except I'd rather NOT have medical mysteries.  My body is a biomechanical interface device and I wish I could just take it to a body shop for repairs.  This shell is just a [[chassis]] for who I am.  As a [[transhumanist]], I'd like to move beyond it.

I've studied a lot of random medical topics.  I haven't pulled it together like a course of study.  I've pursued whatever I can, in bits and pieces, hunting for potentials.  So far 'nothing' comes of it, though I almost feel like I'm participating in something spiritually valid... what a booby prize that is for an [[atheist]]!

Anyways, today I've thought of something interesting that I'd like to record and publish here.  Can we program eukaryotic bacteria to utilize human [[mitochondria]], and then utilize vats of eukaryotic bacteria to produce mitochondria in large quantities?  We use bacteria vats to produce insulin.  It's a similar concept.  One of the factors in human aging is mitochondrial decay.  That issue doesn't seem to impair eukaryotic bacteria from proliferating.  So can we utilize bacteria to produce an eternal supply of young, high-functioning mitochondria for transfusion purposes?  This could be a very important therapy for [[rejuvenative-medical-interventions]].  If there are conditions, poisons, or diseases which hurt people specifically by impairing the functioning of mitochondria, having large quantities of transfusable mitochondria available in hospitals would also save lives quite directly!

If human mitochondrial decay is a flaw in the human mitochondrial descent, can we use mitochondrial production vats to selectively breed for more resilient mitochondria?

This map concept still seems spectacular.  I check the map at least twice as many times as I compose posts.  If I model the connections between my thoughts, can I accelerate my ability to flow between the concepts of them?
