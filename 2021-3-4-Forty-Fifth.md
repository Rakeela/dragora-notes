# 2021-3-4-Forty-Fifth

The Survivor's Guide arrived!  I'm not usually awaiting a book like this.  Although looking at it, right now, before opening it...  I'm pretty sure it won't have anything direct to tell me.  It can't do anything about the species boundary.  It can't make me fundamentally not *disinterested* in humans.

I was thinking about that as I walked through the rain to the postbox where I picked up the delivery.  I've no interest in sex with humans.  Years ago, the furry community's obligate universal interspecies connectivity gave me the impression that it wasn't *acceptable* to be disinterested in sex outside of my species.  I tried to loose my boundaries of species to match.  It didn't work.  I'm more attracted to various animals than I am to humans, and it's not actually because I'm very attracted to various animals.  Humans are just ugly.  You're missing key basic features.

This book has reflection exercises.  A lot of books do.  I've a history of ignoring them, of eliding over them.  I still don't want to copy them in right now to journal about them.  I feel pressed against the impossibility of gaining anything from this.  At the same time, there *are* hints of something to gain.  The idea of safe sex as meaning something more than condoms, of referring also to *emotional* safety...  That's something that was always very denied to me.  At first I was involved in sex, because in my upbringing it was terrible to be "prudish".  Later, I was involved in sex, because that was where I had found 'friends' and 'purpose'... people who exploited me, and destroyed my potential to achieve activities of actual purpose...

Ahem.  This book has reflection exercises.  It also has a heavy fixation on sexual acts.  I don't really think I need the sex-ed stuff... or at least, I don't think I really want it.  Maybe it'll be interesting in a more light recreational mood.

That's not to say it doesn't have emotional weight at points.  For instance, on page 57...

I do not know that I am loved unless someone is having sex with me.  Of course, once we are having sex, I think that is all they want me for.  It's a catch-22  -- Hannah

I know *that* feeling.  That sounds like finding 'friends' in sexuality... and only in sexuality.  Heh.  Page 56 and 57 hit pretty hard in general for me.  I don't think this book is the guide I need to work through Ihroun's story, but if I do write it out, I'll at least come back to this page.

Some of the stuff in this book about dissociation makes me wonder if the total anhedonia of sexual interaction is something that won't necessarily always afflict me.  On the other hand, it looks like the deeply anhedonic sex responses are symptomatic of "unwanted sex", so that may be intrinsic enough that I would have that just for not being attracted to humans.  

I'm not sure how long this book will sit around in my workspaces.  It's not as topical as I'd hoped.  I do want to highlight another quotation from it while I'm here.  

(Quoted from Source)
You didn't get hurt alone, and you can't heal alone.  Support is essential to any healing process.  Isolation plays a key role in childhood sexual abuse.  Most children never tell what is happening to them, and many who do tell are not believed or given adequate support.  Adult survivors tend to continue to live in isolation.  Coming out of isolation means coming into relationships.  This, in and of itself, is a part of healing sexually.

It seems like a lot of people in society could benefit from that.

Sorry about the date update.  I wrote this yesterday, and incorrectly dated it to the fifth.
