I was falling asleep in a meeting until I did something direly awful that I'm not happy about, which was to join another meeting while opening up my notes files to work on a third project.

That woke me immediately, but it wasn't good for my quality of participation in any of the contexts.  I'm disappointed by the wakefulness effect.  It seemed suspiciously useless that I woke up like that.
