I've submitted an exam in chemistry.  I've done fine so far and yet every test is a particular misery.  I worry my GPA won't be good enough to get the higher level degree that I need in order to pursue immunology.

Math courses seem more likely to drag down my GPA than the main science courses.  I'm just not fast enough at math.  My most recent test in Trigonometry came up a C.  I don't think I can get a PhD as a C student.
