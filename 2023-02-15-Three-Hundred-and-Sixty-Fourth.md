I have bought a huge amount of sweets this week.  This weekend is going to be a massive temperance challenge for me.  I have waaaay more than I can eat, but I could easily eat myself sick if I don't restrain my eating.  It'll set back my weight loss, too.

Meanwhile:  Mm!  I drank an overpriced coffee beverage laced with protein and MCT oil.  It was low in carbs and surprisingly filling!

If I ate lightly enough, alternate day fasting would cause me to lose weight.  I'd have to eat veeerry lightly though.  Experimenting with my metabolism reveals the difficulty of losing weight!
