Alcohols are classified by the number of alkyl groups attached to the carbon bonded to the hydroxyl.  Primary alcohols are attached to a carbon attached to one alkyl group.  Secondary and tertiary alcohols are attached to a carbon attached to two and three alkyl groups, respectively.

Because there is a large electronegativity difference between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the -OH group, the oxygen has a partially negative charge, the hydrogen has a partially positive charge, and hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen of one alcohol and hydrogen in the -OH group of another alcohol.  Alcohols have higher boiling points than alkanes and ethers of similar mass, because a higher temperature is required to break their hydrogen bonds.

Hydrogen bonds cannot form between ether molecules because they have no polar -OH groups.  The boiling points of ethers are similar to those of alkanes of similar mass, because neither can form hydrogen bonds.

Alcohols contain polar -OH groups and form hydrogen bonds with water.  With 1-4 carbon atoms they are soluble in water.  With 5 or more carbon atoms they are not.  The extra carbons are too cumbersome and will cause the alcohol to separate out.

Ethers can form hydrogen bonds with water.  They have fewer hydrogen bonds possible than alcohol and will form fewer.  They are only slightly soluble in water when they have fewer than 4 carbon atoms.  They are not soluble in water if they have 5 or more carbon atoms.

(Commentary:  Nobody raises their hand to answer the study checks, so there's an interesting little social game I play every time, trying to predict when someone else will respond so I can choir them.  I don't want to speak too soon and be answering all of them myself, nor too late such that I seem like I picked up the answer from others.)

Phenols, once used as antiseptics, are slightly soluble in water thanks to the -OH group that can form hydrogen bonds with water.  Phenols can react with water to produce phenoxide ions.  In water, the -OH group of phenol ionizes slightly, which makes it a weak acid (Ka=1x1-^=10).  (The reaction is given that Phenol + H2O <-> Phenoxide- + H3O+, a reaction where the -OH group on the phenol loses its hydrogen atom to the H2O molecule.). Phenols are corrosive and irritating to the skin.

Antiseptics, substances applied to the skin to kill microorganisms that cause infection were once made of dilute solutions of phenol.  They were once used to disinfect wounds to prevent post-surgical infections such as gangrene.  They are not used in Lysol, used to disinfect surfaces, and contain the antiseptics 2-phenylphenol and 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenol.  (The molecule is given of 2-phenylphenol, a molecule with two benzene rings and an OH group.). (The molecule is given of 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenyl, a molecule with two benzene rings, an -OH group, and a chorine atom.)

(Commentary:  Phenylphenol is an interesting name.  That indicates that a benzene ring (phenyl) is attached to a phenol (a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group).)

Hand sanitizers containing ethanol as their active ingredient kill most bacteria and viruses that spread colds and flus.  They are apprxoimately 60% (v/v) but can be as high as 85% (v/v).  They are highly flammable and burn with a transparent, blue flame.  They may also contain triclosan, which can accumulate in the environment, promoting growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  (Commentary:  The teacher recommends avoiding hand sanitizers containing triclosan.)  (The molecule is given for triclosan, which contains two benzene groups, one of which is a phenol, connected by an oxygen.  The benzene ring has two chloride atoms while the phenol ring has one chloride atom, both of which are in the 1,3 or m-positioning.  We won't need to memorize this one, but it looks interesting.  Is that called a diphenyl ether?)
