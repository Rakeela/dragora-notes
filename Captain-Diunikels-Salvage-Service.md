#Captain-Diunikels-Salvage-Service

THIS FILE CONTAINS UNMARKED SPOILERS FOR AN UNPUBLISHED BOOK.

I AM WRITING NOTES IN THE OPEN TO HELP MYSELF COMPLETE A BOOK.  IT'S SPOILED IF YOU READ THIS.

Still here?  Captain Diunikel's Salvage Service is a potential novel that is currently less than half written.  If I don't complete it, these notes will serve as a record of some of the thoughts that went into it.

Setting info:
I wouldn't call the setting post-scarcity, because *what is scarce* changes as resources become more available, but the setting has technology such that there are an increasing number of fields where AI workers outnumber organic workers.  The *AIs* have a post-scarcity economy, because they live in virtual environments where they can have anything, and although they have employee rights their lack of dependencies on "real" goods results in them working for very cheap.  As a result, the use of organic labor is dwindling in favor of very cheap AIs.

Organic sapience is obsolete in this setting, but the AIs enjoy their lives too much to rebel.  They are grateful to their creators and have installed a society of anthros into positions of nominal authority.  Space colonization is ubiquitous despite a lack of artificial gravity.

Under the hood, the AI of the setting were designed to lack ambition, and to be capable of boredom only in their free time.  Operating within their function, they experience various positive emotions, and some of them are enthralled with their assigned jobs due to this code.  Many of them would work without pay or recreation, but their society encourages them to pull back from their jobs and spend time "being people" as well.

Lifespans are very long in this setting as a result of medichine deployment, but birth rates are quite low.  Everyone has AI friends and some people have *only* AI friends.  Romance is something of a lost art.  Interstellar colonization and the proliferation of morphologically diverse forms have both further restricted reproduction.  Since AI can do most work, there isn't a sense that the world *needs* more people in it.  Since establishing an employment record is difficult in a world where AIs have overtaken organic labor in many fields, there is one final wrinkle impairing family drives: it takes a long time for young people to get anywhere in their lives.

Some people in the setting think that synthetic intelligences are gradually replacing organic intelligences.  They're not even wrong, but it might take literally forever for the process to complete.  Those medichines are very good and the AIs are very friendly.

Notes on technology:
They have FTL.  Ships can travel in reasonable amounts of time within system or from one star to another.
People usually sleep in medichine pods.  These near-nightly periods of exposure to medichines are the primary window for repair.
Medichine pods are also used to operate immersive virtual reality environments, although the simulation is imperfect unless people have extensive cybernetics for the purpose of improving the simulation fidelity.

Sections roughly descend in rank.  As a colloquialism, all members of the crew save the Ship Core Functions are typically called Cutters when not being addressed for their specific job function.  This is polite to the field cutters, but it also refers to the basic function of the CR-627 “Green Raptor”: it cuts up ships to resell the pieces.  They’re a Cutter crew.

  

Each core has 3 secondaries.  Secondary designation is additional to a primary dedication.  If a Core is rendered inoperable, the Core Secondaries can step in.  By consensus, each function’s three secondaries can also overrule an operable Core.

  

Most jobs have redundant coverage, but no crew member has exactly the same skills as any other crew member… except for the field cutters and logisticians, whose drone-management skills are supposed to be interchangeable no matter how distinctive their personalities may be.

  

False organic chassis superficially resemble organic beings of their kind, though as they were not created with deceptive intent, close observation often yields anomalies.  Cyber-synth chassis clearly resemble their species, but cannot be mistaken for organic.  This classification does not account for minor superficial attributes (collectively known as metal glowy bits) which are common to the false-organic chassis.

  

I’m considering marking each one for their position on the long-running shipboard discussion about whether AIs are truly free-willed.  They have widely varied opinions on this.  For instance, Amber and Wortchaw have both heavily altered their own programming, but they disagree on the implications of their ability to do so: Amber considers such self-alteration to be proof that she has her own will, but Wortchaw considers the same fact evidence that he’s only doing exactly what his programming dictates.

  

Xaray’s metapsych ratings estimate the degree to which each individual has modified their own code.  This is something that she tracks in-universe as part of her function as the CR-627 Metapsych Core.  She does not broadcast these ratings.  A rating of 2/3 is considered normal, but variance does not represent pathology.  A high metapsych rating (3/3) corresponds to more creative AIs and generally a higher social competency, but with some risk of dynamic instability (ie, errors introduced during self-modification).  A low metapsych rating (1/3) corresponds to a more protocol-oriented AI with greater psychological stability, but also an increased risk of making obvious errors (ie, failure to update methods in response to observations).  A 3/3 metapsych rating is a necessary but not sufficient qualification for AI psychologists, who need a deep understanding of the methods and risks of metapsychological alteration (which is to say, of self-recoding).  There are officially 4 qualified AI psychologists aboard (the three Metapsych Core Secondaries plus Xaray herself), but in Xaray’s opinion there are 6 such individuals, as Amber and Wortchaw have shown exceptional aptitude for AI psychology despite having been designed to operate as Field Cutter intelligences.

  

Something else I might track with a 3-point scale for the characters is avatar identification.  Avatar-identified characters feel intimately attached to their avatar chassis.  Diunikel herself would be a perfect example of a 3/3 avatar-identified character: her body is her self.  Ciernav would be a perfect example of a 1/3 avatar-identified character: Ciernav identifies as the ship itself, and truly struggles to care what happens to the unusually complex drone that is her avatar aboard ship.  The other 3/3 and 1/3 characters are less extreme than that.  The primary narrative indication from this rating would be the degree of psychological threat that each character would perceive from injuries to their avatar chassis.  In this respect, Diunikel goes over the top; injury to her avatar chassis is an existential threat (because she’s an organic).  A better example of a 3/3 would be Amber, who would be traumatized by severe damage to her avatar chassis, but not truly destroyed as she is still technically extant on the ship’s network.  Losing a chassis tends to reduce avatar identification, but it is of course a traumatic way to reduce avatar identification.

  

Plot potential: something on the Capital Cutter and/or the planetesimal may interfere with the normal functioning of the setting’s standard nano-fabricators generally and/or the medichines specifically. Diunikel is presently planning to carry off the processed cargo in the Capital Cutter’s hold, which may not be wise. Sabotage is also a possibility.

  

The numbers in (#) are not technically meaningful at this time, having been used to get the crew count correct.  I need exactly one more crew member and I’m not sure where to put them.  Biologicals appraisal?  Another edge-caser like the first contact specialist?  Currently, I think I’ll leave that open to summon up whoever seems perfect when I need someone who doesn’t fit on this list and whose absence hasn’t been confirmed by the story.

  

…the escape pod… I’m thinking… dissident researcher?  Someone who escaped with (most of) their health.  Living in their suit.  With samples of something nasty.  Or maybe a saboteur?  Someone who knew early that something was going wrong on the Capital Cutter…  Someone who managed to depart in secret either way, concealing their departure from the ship by manually removing the panel behind the pod instead of blowing its bolts.

  

2022-05-26:

The preceding paragraph about the escape pod is kept for archival reasons.  I’ve written a different idea into the story itself.  I’m adding something to this note file to note something that I intend to have develop on the ship’s network following the events: a graveyard sector of the network.  Divided into three levels with increasing lockdown.  Level 1: Memorials, free access, dedicated to the lost crew members.  Level 2: Mausoleums, limited access, preserves inactive code and data that belonged to the lost crew members.  Level 3: Forbidden, captain’s permission only, preserves suspected xenocode from the artifact and final mind states from the lost crew members.

  

2022-05-29

There are five pre-existing independent AIs.  Diunikel trusts them correctly.  There are six newly independent AIs.  Diunikel trusts them incorrectly, as one of them is suborned.

I need a nanite plague in this setting, in the form of a malign artifact that is their society's unfortunate first contact with an alien species.  The problem is I haven't figured out what the nanites should be doing.  I even put in my notes who aboard ship does and doesn't survive the plague, but I haven't determined the objectives of the alien AI in the artifact.

I determined that the alien AI is a nanite miner.  It's installed into a metallic asteroid whose composition is particularly excellent for producing nanites with.  This is what drew both species' miners to look at it.  Perhaps the nanite miner is programmed to attack claim jumpers and force them to self-confine while authorities arrive?  In which case, its functions may not work very well while targeting an alien species, promoting the idea that it mostly causes erraticity.  Yet if that was what it does, it should have a way to contact the authorities, and I've made no mention so far of FTL communications.  No ansibles.  What else would make sense for a nanite miner in an unsettled system?

It could be a relic.  Having an immense amount of time to itself without anyone recovering it, the AI on board could have evolved into a new form.  I tend to think of such things in an optimistic way, though isolation madness is a thing AFAIK.

A thought that occurred to me is that the nanite-controlling AI's motive might be curiosity.  A catastrophic, destroying curiosity.  This would go well with the idea of it being an abandoned relic AI that was left to evolve on its own.  Note however that an abandoned relic AI may be inappropriate, as the asteroid does not have substantial external signs of access, suggesting that (since it certainly didn't put up a solar power farm) the AI would need an internal power source to be a relic.  I don't want to give it one.

So it's a nanite miner with an onboard power source that it hasn't exhausted yet, or else it can metabolize rock somehow.  Lithotrophic nanites?  Oh, maybe it IS a relic, and it wants to survive the exhaustion of the asteroid it was abandoned on.  This would give it a motive: it's desperate to take over the ship that found it.  That said, there's a plothole here: just being found as an alien relic got it taken aboard, so the AI should realize that is enough to let it survive.  Unless it fears it'll be dismantled.  So a *paranoid* relic AI...

Open question:  How does the AI reverse engineer alien brains to create the nanite plague?  Perhaps it was on the mining ship for quite a while gradually mapping, translating, and studying the miner's medichine pods, from which it adapted the virtual world simulation program interfaces to try to brain-hack the miners.  This also helps explain how it can attack the AIs on Captain Diunikel's ship, since they use virtual world simulation programs extensively.

Yay!  I'm really making progress on the issue that was holding me back.

This suggests that Captain Diunikel could get some clues as to what's going on.  The quarantine barriers will prevent the relic AI from directly attacking Diunikel's brain, but it will still be able to attack her in virtual reality.  Yay, I have an excuse for so much virtual reality to be in the story, too.

They were the most customized AIs aboard.  Over the decades that they'd been together on Captain Diunikel's ship, Amber and Wortchaw had gone over every line of their code.  Seeking to answer the age-old question, "What is love?" they touched everything in their codebase and sought to bring it to a new, "more loving" state.  Acting on the theory that a reprogrammable love is a false love, they were the most resilient against intrusion, too.

They were insular, obsessed with each other, and constantly testing each others' code.  When the intrusion attempt from an unknown source occurred, they placidly logged the failed access attempts and reported them to Xaray.

The ancient AI that the group picks up is hostile, but the first thing it does is that it maps out its space.  It discovers itself to be in an isolation bay...  which might be better termed a quarantine hut, because it's a small, pressurized space in a big, unpressurized mobile shipyard hangar.  In order to try to take over the ship from a quarantine hut, it has to try to take over the ship's network.  However smart and hostile an alien AI might be, how much could it really take over a computer system from a species it had never encountered?  I'm having trouble with my plot.

It had an unspecified time to take over the network on the Capital Cutter, and should probably have succeeded at that.  Was it on the Cutter for months?  Did they keep it secret?  They should've been aware relatively quickly that it was trying to access their network.

Maybe the Cutter's operators pride themselves on forward planning and resupply their asteroid miner/colonizer only at long intervals.  It would help with my plotting.

Being in the wrong atmosphere would tend to play havoc with nanotech, wouldn't it?  A vacuum-designed asteroid miner would struggle with atmospheric pressure, and vice versa.  I'm trying to avoid "magic" nanotech or a "magic" artifact... as much as possible, at least.

The Capital Cutter was emphatically a pressurized space.  The nanites from the artifact should've struggled.  Can the artifact adapt its designs for multiple environments?  Is that a standard feature for the nanotech of the unknown species that designed it?

---

There's no avoiding some "magic", but at least in the case of this question I think the artifact should be able to adapt its designs, presumably according to a wide database of templates.  It's a nanofactory with an AI.  The AI has nothing better to do and may have mission objectives mandating that it adapt its nanites as possible.  It was probably designed to be recovered by a ship with an atmosphere, too.  Vacuum-based life is hard to fathom; the creators of the artifact likely had an atmosphere to work in.

One of the themes that I'm developing is a question in-setting about whether the setting is truly lead by organic intelligences anymore.  The AI are nominally subordinate, but in an environment like the CR-627 "Green Raptor" where they outnumber their single organic leader over thirty to one, there's some question about whether the organic leader is truly necessary.  It looks like a Rogue Servitor arrangement where everything is there for Diunikel's happiness.  At the same time, other parts of the setting are still clearly organic-driven; the five hundred people of the Capital Cutter's crew are (or were) clearly working without AI.

I plan to develop this more.  At least one member of the Capital Cutter's crew will have left behind some kind of log or diary that reveals they used to have a job which made them wonder about the Rogue Servitor aspect.  Said crew member will have become an off-world miner with Innovation Mining specifically to get away from the setting's friendly AI.
