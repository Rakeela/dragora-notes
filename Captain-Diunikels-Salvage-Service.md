#Captain-Diunikels-Salvage-Service

THIS FILE CONTAINS UNMARKED SPOILERS FOR AN UNPUBLISHED BOOK.

I AM WRITING NOTES IN THE OPEN TO HELP MYSELF COMPLETE A BOOK.  IT'S SPOILED IF YOU READ THIS.

Still here?  Captain Diunikel's Salvage Service is a potential novel that is currently less than half written.  If I don't complete it, these notes will serve as a record of some of the thoughts that went into it.

Setting info:
I wouldn't call the setting post-scarcity, because *what is scarce* changes as resources become more available, but the setting has technology such that there are an increasing number of fields where AI workers outnumber organic workers.  The *AIs* have a post-scarcity economy, because they live in virtual environments where they can have anything, and although they have employee rights their lack of dependencies on "real" goods results in them working for very cheap.  As a result, the use of organic labor is dwindling in favor of very cheap AIs.

Organic sapience is obsolete in this setting, but the AIs enjoy their lives too much to rebel.  They are grateful to their creators and have installed a society of anthros into positions of nominal authority.  Space colonization is ubiquitous despite a lack of artificial gravity.

Under the hood, the AI of the setting were designed to lack ambition, and to be capable of boredom only in their free time.  Operating within their function, they experience various positive emotions, and some of them are enthralled with their assigned jobs due to this code.  Many of them would work without pay or recreation, but their society encourages them to pull back from their jobs and spend time "being people" as well.

Lifespans are very long in this setting as a result of medichine deployment, but birth rates are quite low.  Everyone has AI friends and some people have *only* AI friends.  Romance is something of a lost art.  Interstellar colonization and the proliferation of morphologically diverse forms have both further restricted reproduction.  Since establishing an employment record is difficult in a world where AIs have overtaken organic labor in many fields, it takes a long time for young people to get anywhere in their lives, and there isn't a sense that the world *needs* more people in it.

Some people in the setting think that synthetic intelligences are gradually replacing organic intelligences.  They're not even wrong, but it might take literally forever for the process to complete.  Those medichines are very good and the AIs are very friendly.

Notes on technology:
They have FTL.  Ships can travel in reasonable amounts of time within system or from one star to another.
People sleep in medichine pods.  These near-nightly periods of exposure to medichines are the primary window for repair.
Medichine pods are also used to operate immersive virtual reality environments, although the simulation is imperfect.

I need a nanite plague in this setting, in the form of a malign artifact that is their society's unfortunate first contact with an alien species.  The problem is I haven't figured out what the nanites should be doing.  I even put in my notes who aboard ship does and doesn't survive the plague, but I haven't determined the objectives of the alien AI in the artifact.

I determined that the alien AI is a nanite miner.  It's installed into a metallic asteroid whose composition is particularly excellent for producing nanites with.  This is what drew both species' miners to look at it.  Perhaps the nanite miner is programmed to attack claim jumpers and force them to self-confine while authorities arrive?  In which case, its functions may not work very well while targeting an alien species, promoting the idea that it mostly causes erraticity.  Yet if that was what it does, it should have a way to contact the authorities, and I've made no mention so far of FTL communications.  No ansibles.  What else would make sense for a nanite miner in an unsettled system?
