#Captain-Diunikels-Salvage-Service

A potential novel that is currently half or less written.  I wouldn't call the setting post-scarcity, because *what is scarce* changes as resources become more available, but the setting has technology such that there are an increasing number of fields where AI workers outnumber organic workers.  The *AIs* have a post-scarcity economy, because they live in virtual environments where they can have anything, and although they have employee rights their lack of dependencies on "real" goods results in them working for very cheap.  As a result, the use of organic labor is dwindling.

Organic sapience is obsolete in this setting, but the AIs enjoy their lives too much to rebel.  They are grateful to their creators and have installed a society of anthros into positions of nominal authority.

Under the hood, the AI of the setting were designed to lack ambition, and to be capable of boredom only in their free time.  Operating within their function, they experience various positive emotions, and some of them are enthralled with their assigned jobs due to this code.  Many of them would work without pay or recreation, but their society encourages them to pull back from their jobs and spend time "being people" as well.

Lifespans are very long in this setting as a result of medichine deployment, but birth rates are quite low.  Everyone has AI friends and some people have *only* AI friends.  Romance is something of a lost art.  It takes a long time for young people to get anywhere in their lives.
