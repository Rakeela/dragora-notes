#Captain-Diunikels-Salvage-Service

THIS FILE CONTAINS UNMARKED SPOILERS FOR AN UNPUBLISHED BOOK.

I AM WRITING NOTES IN THE OPEN TO HELP MYSELF COMPLETE A BOOK.  IT'S SPOILED IF YOU READ THIS.

Still here?  Captain Diunikel's Salvage Service is a potential novel that is currently less than half written.  If I don't complete it, these notes will serve as a record of some of the thoughts that went into it.

Setting info:
I wouldn't call the setting post-scarcity, because *what is scarce* changes as resources become more available, but the setting has technology such that there are an increasing number of fields where AI workers outnumber organic workers.  The *AIs* have a post-scarcity economy, because they live in virtual environments where they can have anything, and although they have employee rights their lack of dependencies on "real" goods results in them working for very cheap.  As a result, the use of organic labor is dwindling in favor of very cheap AIs.

Organic sapience is obsolete in this setting, but the AIs enjoy their lives too much to rebel.  They are grateful to their creators and have installed a society of anthros into positions of nominal authority.  Space colonization is ubiquitous despite a lack of artificial gravity.

Under the hood, the AI of the setting were designed to lack ambition, and to be capable of boredom only in their free time.  Operating within their function, they experience various positive emotions, and some of them are enthralled with their assigned jobs due to this code.  Many of them would work without pay or recreation, but their society encourages them to pull back from their jobs and spend time "being people" as well.

Lifespans are very long in this setting as a result of medichine deployment, but birth rates are quite low.  Everyone has AI friends and some people have *only* AI friends.  Romance is something of a lost art.  Interstellar colonization and the proliferation of morphologically diverse forms have both further restricted reproduction.  Since establishing an employment record is difficult in a world where AIs have overtaken organic labor in many fields, it takes a long time for young people to get anywhere in their lives, and there isn't a sense that the world *needs* more people in it.

Some people in the setting think that synthetic intelligences are gradually replacing organic intelligences.  They're not even wrong, but it might take literally forever for the process to complete.  Those medichines are very good and the AIs are very friendly.

Notes on technology:
They have FTL.  Ships can travel in reasonable amounts of time within system or from one star to another.
People sleep in medichine pods.  These near-nightly periods of exposure to medichines are the primary window for repair.
Medichine pods are also used to operate immersive virtual reality environments, although the simulation is imperfect.

I need a nanite plague in this setting, in the form of a malign artifact that is their society's unfortunate first contact with an alien species.  The problem is I haven't figured out what the nanites should be doing.  I even put in my notes who aboard ship does and doesn't survive the plague, but I haven't determined the objectives of the alien AI in the artifact.

I determined that the alien AI is a nanite miner.  It's installed into a metallic asteroid whose composition is particularly excellent for producing nanites with.  This is what drew both species' miners to look at it.  Perhaps the nanite miner is programmed to attack claim jumpers and force them to self-confine while authorities arrive?  In which case, its functions may not work very well while targeting an alien species, promoting the idea that it mostly causes erraticity.  Yet if that was what it does, it should have a way to contact the authorities, and I've made no mention so far of FTL communications.  No ansibles.  What else would make sense for a nanite miner in an unsettled system?

It could be a relic.  Having an immense amount of time to itself without anyone recovering it, the AI on board could have evolved into a new form.  I tend to think of such things in an optimistic way, though isolation madness is a thing AFAIK.

A thought that occurred to me is that the nanite-controlling AI's motive might be curiosity.  A catastrophic, destroying curiosity.  This would go well with the idea of it being an abandoned relic AI that was left to evolve on its own.  Note however that an abandoned relic AI may be inappropriate, as the asteroid does not have substantial external signs of access, suggesting that (since it certainly didn't put up a solar power farm) the AI would need an internal power source to be a relic.  I don't want to give it one.

So it's a nanite miner with an onboard power source that it hasn't exhausted yet, or else it can metabolize rock somehow.  Lithotrophic nanites?  Oh, maybe it IS a relic, and it wants to survive the exhaustion of the asteroid it was abandoned on.  This would give it a motive: it's desperate to take over the ship that found it.  That said, there's a plothole here: just being found as an alien relic got it taken aboard, so the AI should realize that is enough to let it survive.  Unless it fears it'll be dismantled.  So a *paranoid* relic AI...

Open question:  How does the AI reverse engineer alien brains to create the nanite plague?  Perhaps it was on the mining ship for quite a while gradually mapping, translating, and studying the miner's medichine pods, from which it adapted the virtual world simulation program interfaces to try to brain-hack the miners.  This also helps explain how it can attack the AIs on Captain Diunikel's ship, since they use virtual world simulation programs extensively.

Yay!  I'm really making progress on the issue that was holding me back.

This suggests that Captain Diunikel could get some clues as to what's going on.  The quarantine barriers will prevent the relic AI from directly attacking Diunikel's brain, but it will still be able to attack her in virtual reality.  Yay, I have an excuse for so much virtual reality to be in the story, too.

They were the most customized AIs aboard.  Over the decades that they'd been together on Captain Diunikel's ship, Amber and Wortchaw had gone over every line of their code.  Seeking to answer the age-old question, "What is love?" they touched everything in their codebase and sought to bring it to a new, "more loving" state.  Acting on the theory that a reprogrammable love is a false love, they were the most resilient against intrusion, too.

They were insular, obsessed with each other, and constantly testing each others' code.  When the intrusion attempt from an unknown source occurred, they placidly logged the failed access attempts and reported them to Xaray.

The ancient AI that the group picks up is hostile, but the first thing it does is that it maps out its space.  It discovers itself to be in an isolation bay...  which might be better termed a quarantine hut, because it's a small, pressurized space in a big, unpressurized mobile shipyard hangar.  In order to try to take over the ship from a quarantine hut, it has to try to take over the ship's network.  However smart and hostile an alien AI might be, how much could it really take over a computer system from a species it had never encountered?  I'm having trouble with my plot.

It had an unspecified time to take over the network on the Capital Cutter, and should probably have succeeded at that.  Was it on the Cutter for months?  Did they keep it secret?  They should've been aware relatively quickly that it was trying to access their network.

Maybe the Cutter's operators pride themselves on forward planning and resupply their asteroid miner/colonizer only at long intervals.  It would help with my plotting.
