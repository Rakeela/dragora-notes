I've realized that I can tighten up my fasting schedule with little loss of hedonic potency by instituting a new rule that I skip dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday.  That creates space for a 24 hour fast in the middle of the feasting period, which is long enough to enable some good deep ketosis in the middle of the fast break.  I can only eat one really large meal per day anyways, and this lets me further concentrate the two 'primary' large meals just as well as I could before.  A morning feast and an evening feast are hedonically distinct!

When I said to Kistaro that it seems like I really want to eat about two meals per week, zie said, "That's very komodo dragon of you," and then went on to describe that as a very lizard pattern of food consumption.  I was very pleased by this response and I wish to preserve the event of it.  I didn't do it intentionally, but yes, it *is* more like the pattern of meals I used to prefer.

It looks like if I carve off all the food consumption except the bits that I actually want most, my weight goes down.

There's been a great thunderstorm this evening as well, with hail!  I'd like to record that, too.  A virtual world perk someday will be the ability to create weather patterns with very 'fun' weather - harsh without violating safety limits.

I bought some mung bean cakes imported from Vietnam, and they're delicious.  Planty-sweet flavor, and I love the texture.  I haven't eaten through the two boxes that I bought, and they're about to go uneaten for a week; I'll see if they're still just as good next weekend.
