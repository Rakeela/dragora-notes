# Intellectual

Intellectuals believe in the life of the mind and deriving value thereof.  Independently of needing to think things through, they *want* to think things through.  Intellectuals will think things through even if there's no gain from doing so; overthinking is a real thing.

Some people try to define intellectualism by status achievements and reject false intellectuals as "psuedointellectuals", but in my experience the people who would actually want the title "intellectual" aren't strongly motivated by the intellectual status achievements that would "earn" it.  Rather, would-be intellectuals want to arrange their life so that thinking things through in great detail is productive to themselves and others, whatever that looks like.
