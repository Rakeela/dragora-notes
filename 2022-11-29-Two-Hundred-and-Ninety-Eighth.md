#2022-11-29-Two-Hundred-and-Ninety-Eighth

This is one of the latest starts I've gotten on my daily writing!  I've just felt so stressed today.  Crushed by the stuff I have to keep up with.  I don't have large responsibilities, but today what little I have is just too much somehow.

I think I spend too much time sitting at my desk, because part of my right thigh has gone numb.  My thigh!  That is such a strange, disquieting region of the body to experience numbness in.  I'm setting up my treadmill and shifting my desk into standing mode so that it will help me get some exercise.
