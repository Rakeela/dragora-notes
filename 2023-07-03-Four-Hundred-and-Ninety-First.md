09:16.  46,008.  But I'm not done with morning stuff yet.

11:18.  I have gotten sidetracked working on a cover commission.

13:55.  46,670.  Ugh.  I'm not doing well today.

15:24.  46,796.  I watched two playthroughs of the Goodbye Volcano High demo.  I watched another variation of Naser's speech - the one you get if you refuse to help him.

15:29.  Today's writing is SO HARD.

15:35.  Credit 79 words of editing.

20:35.  47,046.  I may not get a lot more done.

21:33.  47,597.  1,589 words of progress.  Okay, so today is another quota-day.

21:55.  47,941.  1,933 words of progress.  I'm going to call my writing done for the day.
