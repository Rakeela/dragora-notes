I still think technological solutions are necessary for diseases of abundance.  Continued research into chemical interventions into the metabolism is excellent, for instance.  I'm writing this as I've thought of a different approach.

Imagine an artificial kidney for filtering out blood sugar spikes, specifically.  If it returned sugar to the blood during blood sugar lows, it would reduce the incidence of low blood sugar as well, reducing hunger.  Smoothing glycemic response in this way would effectively lower the glycemic index of the implantee's entire diet.  This is an example of a *chemical reservoir* implant, a kind of thing that I think should be installed for various purposes... if only any of them had been invented.

I was wondering if it could also be helpful to link such a sugar-filter to the start of the small intestine.  Emitting some of the gathered sugars to the small intestine would feed them to the gut bacteria.  Some of the sugar would also be reabsorbed, but the round-trip would still slow its absorption and provide the opportunity for some interception.  Promoting intestinal bacteria with surplus sugar could present a (disgusting) way to emit excess sugars from the metabolism.

If it also promotes diarrhea, at least it'll be promoting diarrhea only in hyperglycemic people who are overnourished and inclined to drink tons of water.  There shouldn't be any fatalities from *that*.

Intuitively, this feels like focusing unduly on a first world health problem, which I'm not inherently afraid to do.  I think the first world is well-developed in an emotional sense as well, but is failing to return maximum value to the world due to failing its own health.  My Health textbook also claims that many developing countries also face rising obesity rates.  Anything that really works against obesity could make economic growth a smoother, more evenly valuable process in poorer countries as well.
