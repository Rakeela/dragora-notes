I feel like eating cheese for a week has damaged my love of food.  I am stopping this foolish idea a little early, even though it was causing me to lose weight, because it has destroyed my digestion.  However, it has not left me hungry.  I have lost weight without being hungry.  I like cheese more now, and I am not beset by my customary desperation to end the fast.  I don't know what I want to eat.  I wasn't neurotically obsessed with food this week like I usually am while fasting.

I considered my cheese fast officially over earlier while eating a pack of crispy okra, but honestly I'm not sure it had enough carbs to even kick me out of ketosis.  I still feel unhungry.  If it weren't for the scary constipation, I would just embrace the cheese.  I kinda want to eat more cheese right now.

The constipation is finally alleviating, but I had to take milk of magnesium to achieve that.  Maybe next week I can eat a ton of cheese, but also take milk of magnesium on wednesday to try to force a minimum amount of... "regularity".
