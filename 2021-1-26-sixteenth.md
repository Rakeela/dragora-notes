I need to figure out what kind of organizational structure I want this archive to be in.  Ideally, I want navigating the links to be helpful.  A top-down structure of rising specificity strikes me as likely to be the most intuitive to utilize, but I'm concerned that the widely disparate thought categories will impair the construction of such a system.  These date-marked files are clearly one category of their own, subcategorized by date to whatever precision is necessary for legibility.  How should I define other categories?

Thoughts about media, perhaps.  Thoughts about science.  I don't think those separate very cleanly for me.  The link between SF&F with actual science may be inconvenient in its truth, not in an intrinsic truth discovery sense itself, but in a sense of being a discovery about the nature of current known sapiences.  Where does species-dysmorphic transhumanism fit?  That's science.  The things I seek with those thoughts are wholly tangible.  Yet it's always going to contain a lot of links across the categories...  I suppose that may not necessarily have to stop me from just linking across the categories.  I'll have to decide between potential ambiguities for every entry, but that's the categorization job itself.  Eh.  I think I just nullified this paragraph.  That was supposed to be an actual dilemma.  Nevermind, carrying on...

I think about books, videogames, futurism, science projects, classwork, climate, geo-engineering...  Aha.  That's a conflict.  Is geo-engineering of the category science projects, climate, or futurism?  What is the hierarchy between those four topics?  What happens when the per-semester topic shifts of schooling mean that any kind of material can potentially be class-work, as geo-engineering thoughts are currently surfacing in my classwork?  This messes with my usage ideal.  If all the category labels can just co-apply, I haven't created a top-down structure of rising specificity.  I've only pushed the wiki-chaos to a higher level of abstraction.

I don't know how to categorize my output.

I often enjoy reading science journalism.  I've occasionally appreciated pop sci publications.  It occurred to me this morning that the flow of science journalism is an actual indicator of the progress of various fields, and if I gathered up the links I found interesting, I'd be extending an archive of the status quo over time with a particular interest in my own subjects of interest.  It would increase my ability to refer my attention to the information content available over time.  Building this reference archive might help me make better choices in biotech markets; if it didn't help me, it would make my errors easier to analyze.

I'm not committing to uploading a bunch of science news links yet, but I'm thinking about it.

Creating citations for my current pair of science classes has resulted in a few news articles being linked, and it has made me wonder about the value of creating such a trace for myself to self-evaluate with.  A record of news articles is a kind of picture traced in the medium of history - a record of how broader events influenced a distant life.  This sounds almost too much like a cultural motive, yet (if I can be forgiven for overusing a word) I traced a profit motive first.  I feel like I need this info.  I always want to know what's state of the art in biotechnology.

...I think I can name something distorting my thoughts right now.  It's the emotional conflict in the essay that I'm trying to build up citations for.  Filling out those citations feels like a monumental task.  It's like it has brought together the emotional reality of every time I've looked up biotechnology with the emotional reality of how I felt two decades ago in public schooling while trying to write about how my summer vacations went.  This is pitting what I consider extremely good in life against what I consider extremely bad in life, and it's kind of saying, "On balance, you'll enjoy collecting these links, even if you suffer extraordinarily while doing so."  By implication that says, "You favor this task enough that you should prepare to do it very well."  If that's true, I absolutely should start accumulating links to what I've seen in journalism that I've enjoyed.
