I need to figure out what kind of organizational structure I want this archive to be in.  Ideally, I want navigating the links to be helpful.  A top-down structure of rising specificity strikes me as likely to be the most intuitive to utilize, but I'm concerned that the widely disparate thought categories will impair the construction of such a system.  These date-marked files are clearly one category of their own, subcategorized by date to whatever precision is necessary for legibility.  How should I define other categories?

Thoughts about media, perhaps.  Thoughts about science.  I don't think those separate very cleanly for me.  The link between SF&F with actual science may be inconvenient in its truth, not in an intrinsic truth discovery sense itself, but in a sense of being a discovery about the nature of current known sapiences.  Where does species-dysmorphic transhumanism fit?  That's science.  The things I seek with those thoughts are wholly tangible.  Yet it's always going to contain a lot of links across the categories...  I suppose that may not necessarily have to stop me from just linking across the categories.  I'll have to decide between potential ambiguities for every entry, but that's the categorization job itself.  Eh.  I think I just nullified this paragraph.  That was supposed to be an actual dilemma.  Nevermind, carrying on...

I think about books, videogames, futurism, science projects, classwork, climate, geo-engineering...  Aha.  That's a conflict.  Is geo-engineering of the category science projects, climate, or futurism?  What is the hierarchy between those four topics?  What happens when the per-semester topic shifts of schooling mean that any kind of material can potentially be class-work, as geo-engineering thoughts are currently surfacing in my classwork?  This messes with my usage ideal.  If all the category labels can just co-apply, I haven't created a top-down structure of rising specificity.  I've only pushed the wiki-chaos to a higher level of abstraction.

I don't know how to categorize my output.
