I found a new 24-hour grocery store!  And they even have vegetarian sandwiches, plus lox!  As well as several kinds of cake that I've never eaten.  They're only six miles away, a distance that I can easily travel, so I can go there lots.

I'm trying to convince myself to commit to finding piscivegetarianism 'real' vegetarianism, too.
