I found a new 24-hour grocery store!  And they even have vegetarian sandwiches, plus lox!  As well as several kinds of cake that I've never eaten.  They're only six miles away, a distance that I can easily travel, so I can go there lots.

I'm trying to convince myself to commit to finding piscivegetarianism 'real' vegetarianism, too.

The voices in my head wanted to hear my old favorite song from childhood.  "Iris", by The Goo Goo Dolls.  I complained to them about the opening, because I always think down on it.  It's sex.  I hate it.  I hated it then.  But the guy breaks into talking about feeling perpetually misunderstood, and that's the chorus.  He talks about wanting to be understood by a world that he doesn't want to see him, because they won't.  I always found that reassuring.  Someone else knew what it was like.

That's... what it's like to complain about sex.  It's to be perpetually misunderstood.

But no, they say.  That's what sex is like.  It really is supposed to be the whole of a person.  The carnal knowledge is supposed to be the whole knowledge.  The private understanding.  The last truth.

THAT IS DEGRADING.  That's something I hated as a preadolescent!  People whose whole self is defined by sex live horrible lives of emotional misery.  They're the ones being misunderstood, because that's NOT the whole of any person!  Sex is not even the true whole self of porn stars and diehard sluts.

Ihroun had her statues and her courier job.  Marchosias had sculpting too, though she was a demon who had no friends.  Ihroun came off as even more totally defined by sex than Marchosias, and still wasn't.  She suffered less for having more real friends.  Sexual people are still complete people.  That song "Iris" should not have been totally about sex!

I wanted it to be an asexual lament...
