9:12.  I woke up ten minutes ago or more, but I spent a while in bed reviewing Discord first.

14:32.  46,659.

15:10.  47,051.  I wrote a bit, I got stalled, I got distracted.  Logging time points helps me return to the task when I feel stalled.

16:19.  48,549.

17:11.  49,800.  3,141 words of progress.  4,629 words on the chapter.  Kind of a long chapter?  It's what it has to be, that's how it feels.
