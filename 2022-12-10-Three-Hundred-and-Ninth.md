Starting with a new file.  Today's target is 826 words.

0 words on the file.  826 words to go.  I've been stalled for hours.  Blank page problem.  I don't know what the next scene should include.

430 words on the file.  396 words to go.  I like this scene.  It's something I need to write.  But I'm not sure how to continue it.  It's a blank page problem again.

1,126 words on the file.  300 words over quota.  I feel like I could do better, but to do better I'll have to start in on the next scene.

1,362 words on the file.  536 words over quota.  I didn't open up a new file, but I saw more to expand upon in this one.
