I'm making a note about a dream I had last night, as it contained concepts that haven't occurred to me for quite a while.  I was attempting to enter into business with two employees for the purpose of manufacturing frictionless linkages using small-scale mag-lev.  These would be sold to other businesses for industrial purposes.

It's not something within my current plans and potentials, but it's an old interest of mine that I may someday return to if possible.

With my concept that the only books I truly own are the ones that I have read, my [[Bibliography]] is a little like my 'true hoard'.  My library is what matters to me.  It's what I most miss from my prior lifetime, and the Bibliography page here lists the books that I can recall having read in this lifetime.

In grade school I read thousands of books that I can no longer recall.  I suspect I'll retain my comprehension of the ones I list in my bibliography for much longer than I've retained my comprehension of the books I read in grade school.  Though I keep thinking that to truly 'own' it I possibly ought to reread Mr. Popper's Penguins (no link), as I can only remember *that* I read it, but hardly a word of what was in it.  Something about performing penguins?  It hardly seems important, though I surely loved it well at the time to have recalled its title ever after.

That humanity offers such a surfeit of good books to read is another of the many reasons I long to live forever.
