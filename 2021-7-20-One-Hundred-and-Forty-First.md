#2021-7-20-One-Hundred-and-Forty-First

I'm making a note about a dream I had last night, as it contained concepts that haven't occurred to me for quite a while.  I was attempting to enter into business with two employees for the purpose of manufacturing frictionless linkages using small-scale mag-lev.  These would be sold to other businesses for industrial purposes.

It's not something within my current plans and potentials, but it's an old interest of mine that I may someday return to if possible.
