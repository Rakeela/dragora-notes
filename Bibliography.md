# Bibliography

I'm thinking of filling this with a listing of books that I've read, and saying a little bit about each.  This structure of wiki-style thought arrangement still seems pretty awesome nearly a month after I started it.  I was scared of publishing so much.  I definitely have had the people who stalked me notice this and try desperately to dump on it in places where I'd see them comment.  Yet despite the online harassment, the things I put here still feel a little more real, stable, and comfortable.  Thinking about it tonight, in the stability of my personality I've been starting to wonder if I might be less traumatized than the people who hate me desperately.

That word 'real', that's doing some esoteric heavy lifting here.  I like being surrounded by laden bookshelves.  I like stroking the spines of books and thinking about them.  Yet I feel like I fall out of sync with a lot of my own thoughts, and I'm mentioning that here because I think "books that I've read" is a category that I'm typically 'out of sync' with.  There's a petty thing, too.  I've read a lot of books.  If I seriously start cataloguing and rereading them in order to catalogue them well, I'll end up pinning a boast factory on the side of my notes files, hah!  It'll be something to talk about, and a fairly extensive collection of stuff that I *could* talk about.

This might be kind of barren for a while, though.  I'm not sure how badly I'll actually want to fill it out.  The list will be forever incomplete, quite certainly, as I don't remember every book I've ever read; in childhood, I read with deranged obsession, seeking escape from the violence of human society by imagining other worlds.  I had good reading comprehension of the two books I read per day... for a few days each, before I overwrote them with still more texts.  I'm also not presently excited to do the part where I say a little bit about each entry.

Note that as this list expands, it is not mostly expanding by my reading books.  It is mostly expanding by my refreshing my awareness of books and affirming to myself that I have indeed read them.  There is presently no specific organization to the numbering on this list, but rather the items in it are listed in the order that I thought of them or noticed them on the shelf.

People think they own their books of paper, ink, and thread, but the only books they truly own are the ones that they have read.

Sections;
1) Series (Fiction) (I haven't necessarily read every book in every listed series; I'll have to fill in the sub-pages for these to be fully informative)

I'm considering putting a list of unusually notable video game manuals onto here as well, though it will likely only be two items long to begin with.  My favorite videogame manual is the game manual for Sierra's Arcanum: of Steamworks and Magick Obscurum.  I would probably add in video game strategy guides in the same section; the strategy guide for the game Outpost is more of a work of art than the buggy, incomplete game itself.  I wish the game Outpost had been successfully completed!
