# Bibliography

I'm thinking of filling this with a listing of books that I've read, and saying a little bit about each.  This structure of wiki-style thought arrangement still seems pretty awesome nearly a month after I started it.  I was scared of publishing so much.  I definitely have had the people who stalked me notice this and try desperately to dump on it in places where I'd see them comment.  Yet despite the online harassment, the things I put here still feel a little more real, stable, and comfortable.  Thinking about it tonight, in the stability of my personality I've been starting to wonder if I might be less traumatized than the people who hate me desperately.

This might be kind of barren for a while.  I'm not sure how badly I'll actually want to fill it in.  The list will be forever incomplete, quite certainly, as I don't remember every book I've ever read; in childhood, I read with deranged obsession, seeking escape from the violence of human society by imagining other worlds ([[Broken-Child]]).  I had excellent reading comprehension of the two books I read per day at my peak reading rate...for a few days each, before I overwrote them with still more texts.  That was second grade.  I don't remember all those books.  I'm also not presently excited to do the part where I say a little bit about each entry.

This list once expanded mostly not by my reading books, but by refreshing my awareness of books and affirming to myself that I have indeed read them.  That well seems to have dried up.  It's been ages since I remembered anew a book I read long ago.  Since then that's been overtaken by my actually reading things, although I no longer speed-read as well or as obsessively as I did in childhood.

People think they own their books of paper, ink, and thread, but the only books they truly own are the ones that they have read.  Credit to the Pun Pony blog for the poem in the previous sentence!

Some of these are credited to the series name alone, others are credited to the series name by the author.  This arises when the series name strikes me as likely to have a reuse conflict.  An example of these is "Winterlands".  Too many things could be called that.

I'm considering putting a list of unusually notable video game manuals onto here as well, though it will likely only be two items long to begin with.  My favorite videogame manual is the game manual for Sierra's Arcanum: of Steamworks and Magick Obscurum.  I would probably add in video game strategy guides in the same section; the strategy guide for the game Outpost is more of a work of art than the buggy, incomplete game itself.  I wish the game Outpost had been successfully completed!
