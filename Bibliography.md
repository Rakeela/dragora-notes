# Bibliography

I'm thinking of filling this with a listing of books that I've read, and saying a little bit about each.  This structure of wiki-style thought arrangement still seems pretty awesome nearly a month after I started it.  I was scared of publishing so much.  I definitely have had the people who stalked me notice this and try desperately to dump on it in places where I'd see them comment.  Yet despite the online harassment, the things I put here still feel a little more real, stable, and comfortable.  Thinking about it tonight, in the stability of my personality I've been starting to wonder if I might be less traumatized than the people who hate me desperately.

That word 'real', that's doing some esoteric heavy lifting here.  I like being surrounded by laden bookshelves.  I like stroking the spines of books and thinking about them.  Yet I feel like I fall out of sync with a lot of my own thoughts, and I'm mentioning that here because I think "books that I've read" is a category that I'm typically 'out of sync' with.  There's a petty thing, too.  I've read a lot of books.  If I seriously start cataloguing and rereading them in order to catalogue them well, I'll end up pinning a boast factory on the side of my notes files, hah!  It'll be something to talk about, and a fairly extensive collection of stuff that I *could* talk about.

This might be kind of barren for a while, though.  I'm not sure how badly I'll actually want to fill it out.  The list will be forever incomplete, quite certainly, as I don't remember every book I've ever read; in childhood, I read with deranged obsession, seeking escape from the violence of human society by imagining other worlds.  I'm also not presently excited to do the part where I say a little bit about each entry.

There is presently no specific organization to the numbering on this list, but rather the items in it are listed in the order that I thought of them or noticed them on the shelf.

I'm considering putting a list of unusually notable video game manuals onto here as well, though it will likely only be two items long to begin with.
