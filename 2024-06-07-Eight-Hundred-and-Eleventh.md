10:40.  98,890.

11:28.  98,890... but I've been thinking about my story, I swear.

13:04.  99,379.  489 words of progress.  Ugh.  It's so hard to advance.

14:09.  99,866.  976 words of progress.  I guess that was a good hour.

14:36.  100,235.  1,345 words of progress.

14:38.  100,317.

14:50.  100,317.  I got discombobulated, because I just finished a subscene.  Now I need to work on the next one, and I'm having switching costs as I try to regear my mind to tackle the new variation.  Like, I don't know how it'll sell what has to be sold.

14:52.  I am horribly tempted to be like, "Oh, I hit a mini-milestone, I don't need to work any more!"  Sigh.  I am going to take a break, but I intend to come back to the work.

15:31.  100,844.  1,954 words of progress.  Okay, this is turning into a respectable day.

16:49.  101,245.  2,355 words of progress.  A little more than six hours in.  I didn't take much of a break earlier when I threatened to do so.

17:49.  102,070.  3,180 words of progress.
