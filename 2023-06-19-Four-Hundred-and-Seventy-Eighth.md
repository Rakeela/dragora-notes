7:38.  I have bought snacks.  The mature and responsible thing to do with them is to throw them away.  They are not that good and they are not that healthy.

10:18.  I have eaten too much this morning.  I overate and have been napping on the couch.  This has mostly felt really, really good... until I've tried to do anything, then it's felt pretty bad.

11:26.  I devoured sub-par chocolates!  Mostly.  I threw out a third of the remaining Mr. Beast chocolate.  It's not good enough.  It goes right in the hall of shame section and I won't buy it again.

11:31.  It's remarkable how gluttonous I am for how bad I feel when I overeat.  Even laying on the couch for hours - while unexpectedly pleasurable - was not a great way to spend the morning.

11:42.  10,631 words on the file.

17:47.  11,546 words on the file.  3,111 words on the chapter.  915 words of progress.  Today has been... a distracted day, more than a hard day.  Even some of my writing time has been plagued by distraction.

18:!6.  11,920.  3,482 on the chapter.  1,289 words of progress.  A conversation about the drug trade in Theoma.

18:48.  Eleven days.  It will take eleven days of walking for Zolcha to get from Oriaryo to Skrend.

19:43.  12,543.  616 words on the chapter.  1,912 words of progress.

20:51.  13,341.  1,424 words on the chapter.

21:11.  13,475.  1,558 words on the chapter.

21:18.  13,547.  1,630 words on the chapter.  2,916 words of progress.  I've set up a challenger to the group.  Just a social/emotional challenge.  I'm not sure how they'll tackle it.
