10:31.  I am depressed this morning.  I cannot think of work.  It's always hard to start.  Well, not always.  It's usually hard to start.  Then I don't want to stop for hours.  Then I can't do anymore.  That's the daily cycle.  I have a dermatology appointment today at 11:30, for variety.

10:43.  40,650 words on the file.

10:49.  My weight loss is hitting a plateau again.  The problem is one of adherence.  Weight loss is very steady if I adhere to my diet, but periodically I lose the will to do so.  Presently I am eating one meal per day with at least 24 hours between meals (so slightly less than one meal per day), but I am not strictly minimizing my intake.  Just restricting when I eat.

12:05.  I am such a chocolate heathen.  Hershey's still seems tasty to me.

12:31.  41,452.  802 words on the chapter.

13:58.  42,031.  1,407 words on the chapter.  Quota get.  But ugh, my back.  It hurt when I woke up.  It still hurts now.  I'm going to lay down for a few minutes.

14:26.  42,216.  1,592 words on the chapter.  

15:29.  2,751 words on the chapter.

15:42.  43,426.  2,797 words on the chapter.  2,776 words of progress.  I did some editing, too.

15:48.  Oh, and chapter complete.  I got distracted reading an article about "vegan fat", a new advancement in plant-based meat.  Vegan pork belly that sizzles like the real thing when cooked.  How remarkable.

16:48.  I got pretty distracted there.  Phew.  Some of that was spent playing Flight Rising.  Some of it was spent catching up on a huge discussion of police brutality in a Discord server that I"m on.  No ideas for what to do in my writing.  One chapter is "acceptable" as a day's writing productivity goes, but it's not optimal.  I usually love writing Kaire, but right now I'm flailing.

16:54.  43,427.  I'm going to credit myself with 2,995 words of editing today.

17:15.  43,728.  301 words on the chapter.  I have a heat wrap on my back.  The spot under it stopped hurting, but the spot above it hurt.  I shifted it up.  The spot under it stopped hurting, but the spot below it hurt.  I shifted it back down.  In a few minutes, I'll probably shift it back up again.  Maybe I should put on two heat wraps, but that seems wasteful.

17:41.  740 words on the chapter.

17:50.  960 words on the chapter.  I love Kaire.

18:26.  1,691.

18:42.  1,804.  I'm slowing down as I contemplate the role of religion in the story.  I'm reading a book about Manichaean theology at the same time.

18:50.  19,75.  I only have so many words to give.  I'm in a conversation I was looking forward to, but it's intensely difficult.  I don't know what role the conversation serves.  I haven't shaped it right.  It *has* to exist, for the characters.

19:03.  2,223.  I'm ruminating on whether one of my characters can pursue divine levels.

19:16.  2,402.

19:26.  2,627.

19:33.  2,780.

19:47.  2,882.

19:56.  46,405.  2,978.  5,755 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  Hm.  If I work into the next chapter, I can break my record again.

19:58.  I'm taking a break.  I may come back.

20:15.  25 words on the chapter.

20:27.  303 words on the chapter.

20:34.  46,880 on the file.  473 on the chapter.  6,230 words of progress.  The record is mine!  Back to back 6k days!

20:59.  895.

21:10.  1,026.  Kinda struggling.  It's not just that it's a Kura chapter.  I'm working through dissonance between the versions.  In the first version of the story, Kura recruits a bunch of 'demons' as summoning contracts.  Can I reuse those characters?  How do I get Kura to look at them now that she's not an "imp summoner"?  She could look at brighter planes now, so why doesn't she?  Ooh!  Complaining here helped me come to an answer.

21:37.  47,708.  1,301.

21:56.  47,922.  1,515.  I think I'm going to go back and regender one of my characters to establish that another character is bisexual.

22:09.  47,930.  1,515.  Earlier edit in.

22:18.  47,984.  1,569.  7,334 words of progress.  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm stopped at a point where the story flexes a bit and I need to determine where it flexes *to*.  I'm getting a headache.  Maybe I've done enough.

22:21.  Yeah, I'm done for the night.  New 2023 writing record!

22:24.  0.6 miles.  131 kcal.  2,715 steps.  36 minutes and 36 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.  I didn't do a lot of walking today.

22:26.  I think I spent more than ten hours writing today.  Maybe even more than eleven.
