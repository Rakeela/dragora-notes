# Moral Hazard of Existential Threat

The ethical issue arising when moral hazard is used to justify extraordinary conducts is the moral hazard of existential threat arguments.  Misusing the x-risk argument in this way is a form of duplicity.  It tends to promote hatred and conflict between people.  A [[pacifist]] should never do this.
