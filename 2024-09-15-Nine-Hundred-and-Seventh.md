5:27.  This time, I got up much closer to when my alarm goes off.

6:02.  Was that half an hour?  z.z  21,015.

6:56.  21,866.

7:02.  21,929.  I'm a bit stymied, and it's still crazy early, so I'm going to go play a mission or two of The Ascent.

8:10.  Wow, the next mission in The Ascent is killer, and it doesn't let me go back to safe zones.  It's the final mission!  I walked past the point of no return.  Now I have to beat the game with the kit I have.

9:47.  23,042.  2,027 words of progress.  I'm taking another break, this time to get some food.

10:27.  Yum yum yum!  Footlong veggie delight.  I had the lady behind the counter apply honey mustard to the sandwich.  This was a questionable choice.  It was still tasty, but garlic aioli would've been *delicious*.

13:43.  24,460.  I had to do some rewriting that slowed me down, but I did it!  Two of my characters should've been long dragons.

14:44.  25,059.  4,044 words of progress.  Going to take a break and play some more The Ascent.

20:03.  I played an awesome TTRPG session.  15.5 miles.  2,519 kcal.  53,614 steps.  10 hours, 19 minutes.  Average speed 1.5 mph.

21:09.  I'm at 50% on the reread of Stone and Paintings.
