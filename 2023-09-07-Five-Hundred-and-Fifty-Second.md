4:24.  I'm up crazy early, and I intend today to be more productive than yesterday was!

4:36.  I had a good dream that I can't remember.  I was really enjoying it, though.  I think there was something about alien societies... with a lot of hang gliding..?  Definitely something about alien societies.  The only part I remember clearly about the dream was the way it concluded by someone trying to sell me churros and getting offended when I told them I didn't like churros.  So they handed me an oversized churro from their stock, free.  I took a bite, and it was a churro, but it was *amazing*.  Like the best churro that I'd ever had.

4:51.  I was wide awake when I woke up, but now I'm starting to feel seriously tired again.  I'm starting to teeter on my feet.

8:53.  I fell asleep on the couch.  I got up, and I'm almost caught up with Nationstates for the day.

9:28.  Ugh.  I still haven't started on my writing.  My gut is misbehaving.  The flatulence is pretty disgusting.

9:34.  Amazing how the minutes fly by.

10:31.  I can't do anything this morning, and I'm weirdly hungry.  Or...  not hungry exactly.  Craving food.  I don't need food.  I'm already overfull from my morning meal.
