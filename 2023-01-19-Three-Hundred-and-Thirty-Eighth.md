I got to sleep around 12:30 AM this morning.

Today, Kistaro is sick.  I guess it wasn't dietary OR foodborne illness, but a contagious pathogen that got me.

I've got 9,057 words recorded on my most recent project.  I haven't changed the file since I recorded that, but today the file reports itself as having 9,094 words on it.  I guess I get a few freebies?  Anyways, I'm not working to a quota today, but I wanted to record my starting point so I'd have an easier time calculating my words written this evening.

10,868 words on the file.  1,811 words of writing today.  Why am I so unproductive?
