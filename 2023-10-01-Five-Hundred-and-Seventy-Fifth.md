09:36.  Just got up.  I snoozed my alarm once and then slept through its recurrence.

11:35.  I need to get to work.  I have some idea of what I'm writing next, but I have this whiny reluctance.  "Ugggh, I don't wanna!"  So I'm poking at a Hc Svnt Dracones character sheet for a tabletop group that I'm trying to set up.

11:50.  Working with tabletop gaming ideas is a bit more... fun.  It's still writing-adjacent.

11:53.  58,287.

12:24.  58,754.

12:49.  58,780.  I got distracted, so I wasn't very productive since the last time point.

1:10.  58,852.  I'm having trouble focusing.  Thinking about Hc Svnt Dracones today is awesomely fun.  It's not *that* bad for my productivity...  I feel like I'm always thinking about at least two things at once.  One thought line is conscious, one thought line is semiconscious.  I used to think I was always thinking of four things at once.  One conscious, one semiconscious, and two unconscious.  I think that might still be an accurate perspective, but obviously I can't access the 'underwater' thought lines with my conscious mind.  What I can do is switch between conscious and semiconscious contemplation of Hc Svnt Dracones and Kura.

1:24.  58,921.  I'm going to head out to a local restaurant for lunch, so I'm stopping here for the moment.

(This part added the next day.)  So I never got back to it after lunch, huh?  What a show of my work ethic.  Fail.  7.0 miles.  1,284 kcal.  26,092 steps.  5 hours, 56 minutes, 14 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.
