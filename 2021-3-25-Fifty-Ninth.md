I gave the chocolate Huel another try.  It was much better this time.  Difference: I watered it down more.  Apparently, it needs that.

Men in our society are treated as though they cannot want anything but sex, and cannot have any purpose other than sex.  I don't think women want equality with that; they would correctly see it as hideously sexually objectifying.

I don't think feminists understand just how much they would have to lift up the social role of men to make it into something they'd be willing to have.  Women in our society have the social power to avoid being treated in the sexually objectifying way that men are, and I hope someday that men achieve equality with them.

The sexual objectification of men is so complete that any man who is isolated is presumed to be sexually depraved.  When I rejected providing sexual services to others, I fell into a splitting void where I was simultaneously a rapist and an incel; being biologically male, I was not believed to have desires other than the sexual, and as far as I can tell, my rejection of sexual exploitation was treated as a demand for the people who sexually exploited me to be *more sexually willing*.  The people I was refusing were not people who I wanted *more sexual willingness* from.

Women have the privilege of being assumed to be actual people, and the privilege of defending their sexual boundaries.  I wish I'd had that.  If 'equality' for women means they get to be people, when do men get to have 'equality', too?
