I gave the chocolate Huel another try.  It was much better this time.  Difference: I watered it down more.  Apparently, it needs that.

Men in our society are treated as though they cannot want anything but sex, and cannot have any purpose other than sex.  I don't think women want equality with that; they would correctly see it as hideously sexually objectifying.

I don't think feminists understand just how much they would have to lift up the social role of men to make it into something they'd be willing to have.  Women in our society have the social power to avoid being treated in the sexually objectifying way that men are, and I hope someday that men achieve equality with them.
