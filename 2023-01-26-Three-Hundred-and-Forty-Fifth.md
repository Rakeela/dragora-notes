2,969 words on the file.  This isn't exactly where I left off yesterday, but I disliked the last few words I wrote yesterday so much I had to delete them and try again to feel right about continuing.

3,944 words on the file.  975 words of progress.  I wrote this much while being completely pinned down with exhaustion.

4,323 words on the file.  1,354 words of progress.  I was actually less productive when I broke free of exhaustion for a few hours.
