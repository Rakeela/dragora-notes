9:09.  I got up at 5:30, but then fell asleep on the couch.

11:49.  I finished Pridelord and have submitted my notes on it.  I've caught up with morning stuff after a good while laying on the couch arguing with voices in my head...  Well, wait.  I still have Flight Rising.  BRB.

12:00.  Okay, done with Flight Rising as well.  And, I want to say, in defense of arguing with voices in my head, it's like an exercise in philosophy.  Reading philosophy books is stimulating to that activity, I think.  I have mixed feelings about philosophy.  I still have a theology book to read.  I think I'll finish it today.

16:58.  What have I done today?  I have been in a pleasant fugue.  I took more notes on the magical system of Theoma.  That was very relaxing.  I am not thinking at my most clear, but I am enjoying myself greatly.  In this state, I have few expectations.  I feel I should edit another chapter of Taltios' Travelogue.

17:01.  82,797.  Wait, yesterday was 82,796.  I guess that change didn't change much in a word count sense.

17:15.  82,896.  127 words of progress.  Credit 2,413 words of editing.

18:41.  32,766 steps.  1,624 kcal.  9.6 miles.  6 hours, 57 minutes, 55 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  I'm done walking for the day.

20:13.  Credit 2,910 words of editing.  83,051.  255 words of progress.  I didn't find anything substantive to add to the work today.  I really enjoy what is currently Chapter 15 in Taltios' Travelogue.  It flows quickly... to me, at least.  3,065 words on the chapter.  I worry it wouldn't be interesting to anyone else.  I see flight as fundamentally introspective, especially soaring vashael flight where the wind is always perfect.

20:20.  83,021.  225 words of progress.  Found something to blat out.  Doesn't help me add space.  I could've expanded it instead of destroying it, but I don't know where to fit the expanded content in, and it tickles at something that I didn't actually think through.
