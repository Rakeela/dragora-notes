19.1 Proteins and Amino Acids

Protein molecules, compared with many of the molecules we have studied, can be gigantic.  The horns of animals are made of proteins.  (An image is given of a grazing cow with very large horns.)

Proteins in the body are polymers made from 20 different amino acids.  They differ in characteristics and functions that depend on the order of amino acids that make up the protein.  They form structural components such as cartilage, muscles, hair, and nails.  They function as enzymes to regulate biological reactions such as digestion and cellular metabolism.  They include hemoglobin and myoglobin that transport oxygen in the blood.

(This slide is dedicated to a table of protein classifications that I should probably come back and copy later.)

Amino acids, the molecular building blocks of proteins, have a central carbon atom called the alpha carbon, bonded to two functional groups: an ammonium group (-NH3+) and a carboxylate group (-COO-), as well as a hydrogen atom and an R group or side chain.

Zwitterions: At physiological pH, the ionized ammonium and carboxylate groups give an amino acid a balance of positive and negative charge, which gives an overall zero charge.  A neutral amino acid, which is called a zwitterion, occurs at a specific pH value known as its isoelectric point (pl).

Amino acids are classified according to their specific R groups.
	* Nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids have hydrogen, alkyl, or aromatic R groups.
	* Polar amino acids have R groups that interact with water, which makes them hydrophilic.
	* Polar neutral amino acids contain a hydroxyl (-OH), a thiol (-SH), or an amide (-CONH2) R group.
	* Polar acidic amino acids contain a carboxylate (-COO-) R group.
	* Polar basic amino acids contain an ammonium (-NH3+) R group.

A summary of amino acid types and their interaction with water. (A table is given about the types of amino acids.)

Nonpolar Amino Acids:  An amino acid is nonpolar when the R group is H, alkyl, or aromatic.  (Condensed structural formulae are given for glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, proline, and tryptophan.)

Polar Amino Acids, Neutral R Group:  An amino acid is polar when the R group is an alcohol, a thiol, or an amide. (Condensed structural formulae are given for serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, asparagine, and glutamine.)

Amino Acids, Charged R Groups:  An amino acid is charged when the R group is a carboxylate (-COO-) or an ammonium (-NH3+) group. (Condensed structural formulae are given for aspartate, glutamate, histidine, lysine, and arginine.  Aspartate and glutamate have carboxylate R groups, while histidine, lysine, and arginine have ammonium R groups.)

(Commentary:  I have in my study materials a sheet of paper that also contains these condensed structural formulae.)

Amino acids have three-letter abbreviations derived from their names, given in Table 19.2, as well as one-letter abbreviations to enable faster transfer of data.  Of the 20 amino acids, 11 have one-letter abbreviations that are the same as the first letter in their names and 9 use different letters.  Arginine R and tyrosine Y use the second letters in their names; phenylalanine is F; and lysine is K; which is near L in the alphabet.

Amino acids can exist as D and L stereoisomers called enantiomers. We draw Fischer projections for alpha-amino acids by placing
 * The carboxylate group at the top
 * the R group at the bottom
 * the -NH3+ group of the L isomer on the left
 * the -NH3+ group of the R isomer on the right.
(The Fischer projection for L-alanine is contrasted with the fischer projection for D-alanine.)  (Commentary: I've been called things condensed structural formulae when I believe they may have been Fischer projections.)

Of the 20 amino acids used to build the proteins in the body, only 11 can be synthesized by the body.  The other 9 are essential amino acids that must be obtained from the proteins in the diet.  (A table is given listing Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine as the essential amino acids.)

Complete proteins such as eggs, milk, meat, and fish contain all the essential amino acids.  Incomplete proteins from plants such as grains, beans, and nuts are deficient in one or more essential amino acids.

19.3 Formation of Peptides

A peptide bond is an amide bond that forms when the -COO- group of one amino acid reacts with the -NH3+ group of the next amino acid.  The linking of two or more amino acids by peptide bonds forms a peptide.  (The example is given of a glycine molecule bonding to an alanaline molecule to form a glycylalanine peptide (aka Gly-Ala or GA) and water.)

The linkiung of two or more amino acids by peptide bonds forms a peptide.  Peptides from from two amino acids are called dipeptides.  From three amino acids, tripeptides.  From four amino acids, tetrapeptides.  From five amino acids, pentapeptides.  Longer chains of amino acids are called polypeptides.

A peptide bond is an amide bond.  It forms between the -COO- group of one amino acid and the -NH3+ group of the next amino acid.

The name of a peptide begins with the name of the N-terminal amino acid residue.  It gives all the following amino acid residues up to the C-terminal amino acid in which the ine or ate endings are replaced with yl.  It retains the complete name of the C-terminal amino acid.  A tripeptide consisting of alanine, glycine, and serine residues is named alanylglycylserine.  (Commentary:  I asked the teacher, who clarified that the C-terminal is the one that has its carboxylate unbonded.  This means the N-terminal must be the one that doesn't have its ammonium bonded.  Makes sense.)

19.2 Amino Acids as Acids and Bases

When an amino acid with positive and negative charges is overall neutral in charge, it is said to be at its isoelectric point (pl).  (An image of a glycine molecule is given with the caption, "Glycine at its pl of 6.0")  Learning goal: Using the zwitterion for an amino acid at its isoelectric point, draw its ionized structures at pH values above or below its isoelectric point.

The isoelectric point of an amino acid is the pH at which the charged groups on an amino acid are balanced and the amino acid is neutral.  An amino acid can exist as a positive ion if a solution is more acidic (lower pH) than its pl, or as a negative ion if a solution is more basic (higher pH) than its pl.

The pl values for nonpolar and polar neutral amino acids are from pH 5.1 to 6.3.  (The condensed structural formula for alanine is given with the caption "Alanine, pH=6.0")  Alanine has zero overall charge at its pl of 6.0 with a carboxylate anion (-COO-) and an ammonium cation (NH3+).

Alanine adds an H+ to the carboxylate group (-COO-) when the solution is more acidic than its pl (pH<6).  (The example reaction is given that zwitterion alanine + hydronium yields alanine+ and water.)  Because the -COOH group is neutral now, alanine has a positive charge (1+) at a pH lower than 6.0.

At a pH higher than 6.0, the -NH3 group loses H+ and forms an amino group -NH2 that has no charge. (The example is given that zwitterion alanine + hydroxide yields alanine- and water.)  Because the (-COO-) group has a charge of 1-, alanine has an overall negative charge (1-) at a pH higher than 6.0.

(Commentary:  This table is a pain to transcribe and it just repeats the content from the preceding paragraphs.  I'm leaving it out of the record.)

(A slide is given to the transformations of aspartate, which has a positive charge at pH<2.8, forms a zwitterion at pH 2.8, has a positive charge at pH 7, and which forms a doubly positive charge at pH>10.)
