Starting at 1,305 words on the file.  Today's target is 856 words.

Stalled at 1,618 words.  Today is hard.  I had to stare at the page for quite a while before I came up with anything at all, and I keep stalling.

1,755 words on the file.  Another hard point.  Writing conversations between characters is difficult.  I'm also a bit frustrated because I don't know which of these conversations will be kept in the next draft.  450 words of progress, 406 words to go.

2,524 words on the file.  1,219 words of progress, 363 words over quota.  My new favorite Theoman character is a land god.  He's so much fun to write.

2,810 words on the file.  1,505 words of progress, 649 words over quota.  This should end the file and the chapter.  The next scene will start the next chapter.
