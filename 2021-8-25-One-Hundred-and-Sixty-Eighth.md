I still play NationStates.  One of the issues cracks a joke about parents being 'up to speed' with the latest parenting techniques.  It's a stimulants joke.  My first response was a reflexive negativity.  My second response was to be intrigued and to think about it.  This morning, I realized: that joke reminds me of my father's mother - on Earth, at least.  My grandmother.

*She* used speed.  Wonderful woman.  Somewhat disturbing aesthetic preferences.  Murderous aphorisms.  Still an absolute lifesaver.  I miss her.

Why did it take me half a day to be reminded of my grandmother?  I'm glad I didn't react immediately on the issue when it arrived; I obviously still needed to think about it more.  It was so unintuitive at first to take the joke as a sign of something that works *right*... but it can work right.  It worked right for my own family.

I'm (appallingly) convinced that common biases regarding parenting quality are horrifically wrong, and I remember from the early internet period my belief that [[pharmacoutopianism]] should be explored.  I'd say it still hasn't been given as much of a chance as it could be given.

What I'm thinking about is just a NationStates issue, but...  I think dredging up cultural commentary is something cultural products are *for*, and people are too shy to credit disreputable influences sometimes.
