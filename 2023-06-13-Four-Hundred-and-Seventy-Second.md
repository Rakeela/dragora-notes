10:08.  I woke up at 8:30.  It took me this long to "get started on my day".

19:19.  84,378.  2,060 on the chapter.  As usual, I got stopped the prior day on something after which I could think of nothing, but I came back this morning and I can immediately think of how to continue it.

10:29.  The thing I thought of to write was immediately faulty.  The characters wouldn't say that.  It was also narmy.

10:44.  84,393.  2,088 on the chapter.  I went through tweaking something from earlier in the story.

10:51.  Credit 751 words of editing.  34 words of editing.  10 words of editing.  795.  Not an adequate tally, but representative of a bit of editing effort.  84,447 words on the file.  2,088 on the chapter.  I've added a detail to the gryphons.

11:19.  84,523.  2,164 words on the chapter.  Struggling with a lack of inspiration.  I need to conclude the story now, in a chapter from now, or in a chapter from that.

11:55.  84,559.  2,198 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?  I really don't want to pad it out any further.

12:00.  I've decided what the last two chapters should be, but they're novel POV shifts that could occur in either order.  Which should I number first?

13:14.  85,705.  1,057 words on the chapter.

13:32.  85,945.  1,297 words on the chapter.  I'm pinning together what I think will be the final chapter in this draft of Kura and Kaire #1.

14:44.  86,976.  1,029 words on the chapter.  Draft complete.

14:48.  The last two chapters of Kura and Kaire are seriously shorter than the others.  That's fine.  They end nicely.  2,598 words of progress.  I wrote one chapter worth of material, then ignored the usual chapter target and split it into two chapters.

16:52.  I have damaged my favorite reusable bag!  Hauling diet soda across town is not feasible.  The price is too high, and by that I mean the price to my poor bags.  None of my reusable bags are durable enough to handle the number of bike-strikes that they are subjected to when they swing next to my front wheels.

17:47.  I am wasting time thoughtlessly.  I feel done for the day, and there's so much day left to experience.  I do not know what to do.  I am just walking on my treadmill and poking at the internet.

17:50.  I completed a major milestone and my mind went splat.  I should at least read my book on Manichaeism, but it has gotten hard to focus on.

18:06.  I complained, and that helped me get a span of good focus on the book.  It's fascinating.  It is talking about how the Manichaeans literalized their doctrines to a very great degree, and how their Elect saw their digestion of the light and dark as a true and literal process.

18:38.  I have found a history book "War Before Civilization" that accords to my own bias that most ancient world societies were extraordinarily violent.

19:20.  86,997.  163 words of editing.  2,619 words of progress.  I thought of something to modify in the text.  I think I just busted a 3k limit on one of the chapters, but I don't care.  I added a world-building detail.
