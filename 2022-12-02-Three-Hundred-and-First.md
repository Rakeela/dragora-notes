Argh!  I didn't complete my writing quota yesterday.  I got to 228 words on the new file and I stopped there, for a total of 588 words of progress.  My quota for the rest of the month goes up because of my day one miss.  I need to write 980 words to stay on track today.

I won't be keeping my writing quota as strictly this month.  The goal isn't so much to produce as many words as possible this time.  It's to finish the story I have in the month of December.  I've estimated I need another 30k words, so 30k is my December goal.

504 words on the file.  276 words of progress, 704 words to go.

889 words on the file.  661 words of progress, 319 words to go.

1,716 words on the file.  1,548 words of progress, 568 words over quota.
