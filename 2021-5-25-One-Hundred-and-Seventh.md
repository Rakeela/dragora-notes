I still remember the shock of discovering that Mel was blocked.  Considering how much I miss him, the idea that I would ever block him seems almost incomprehensible.  Almost.  That last roleplay with him - the "Supercrow" roleplay - really horrified me.  If I blocked him, it was probably because of that.

I hope someday I can talk to him again.  An apology from him would still mean the world to me.

"Would mean the world to me", I got that phrase from DMFA, a webcomic.  I'm not thrilled to mention it.  The author has the social status to creep on others and deny it.  I don't even have the social status to mention media without it being assumed that I'm creeping on others and denying it.  That seems to be how modern social status works.  If you reference anything or anyone from a position of low status, you're a creep who deserves no rights.  If you reference anything or anyone from a position of high status, you have the right to hurt people at will.

Anyways, it's not the fault of any particular person that society is built like that.  I hope someday we get a more liberated society with more equal respect for people.
