I DON'T HAVE A BOOK TO STUDY.  The course didn't list a book.  It doesn't seem to have an online book.  The teacher is going right in to teaching something, but I don't know what he's teaching.  He referenced chapter 0 and I don't have a chapter 0 to open to.  This is a nightmare opening.

He's explaining something titled "A Preview of Calculus".  I get that calculus is about finding the area under a curve.  I'm going to have to go up and ask what book I should be studying.  Chapter 0.1 is "A Preview of Calculus"

Chapter 0.2 is "Lines" and I don't know how to take notes on this lecture.  I don't know how to do the homework assignment, it doesn't display on Canvas.  I found a PDF on the website in the files section that looks similar to what's being taught on the whiteboard.

Section 0.2 seems to be about calculating line equations.  If I can find the homework for this, I'll be okay.  I can practice calculating line equations without too much difficulty.

I've installed a graphing calculator on my computer.  I don't think I need it yet.  I should bring my accustomed graphing calculator to class soon.

Formula from today's lesson and homework:
Finding a line slope is rise/run: m=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
The distance between two points: d=squoot((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2)
To calculate the midpoint between two points, add the x values and halve the sum, then add the y values and halve the sum.

Okay.  I think I understand today's lesson.  I'm still stressed, but now I'm also bored.

Okay.  I think I found the Section 0.2 homework.  Should I just start working on it?

d=squoot(-5-14)^2+(11+20)^2
d=squoot(-19)^2+(31)^2
d=squoot(361+961)
d=~36.359
Correct!

That's 1 of 15 homework problems down.  This guy does give daily homework, doesn't he?  I hope I can handle the workload.  Math homework is slow.
