9:47.  The treadmill is giving me trouble today.  I don't like standing still at my desk, but even the very slow speed to which I'm accustomed feels like too much effort.

9:56.  Time slips by.  I thought I just posted that previous time point.  I'm aching today.  I'm so tired.

9:57.  15,218 on the file.

10:34.  I haven't been working on the file.

10:48.  15,215.  I've been working!

11:58.  15,804.  Progress is difficult, and I've hit another stall point.

14:51.  17,441.  2,223 words of progress.  Hey, I hit quota a little faster this time.

15:23.  17,805.  2,587 words of progress.  My document froze, so I guess I'm taking a little break.

15:54.  18,014.  2,796 words of progress.

16:40.  18,211.  2,993 words of progress.

17:12.  I stopped at my last time point.  I got distracted.  Drifted elsewhere.  I still have a few more hours of evening left.  If I decide what to write in my next chapter, I'm sure I can continue.

19:55.  I'm picking up the writing.

20:28.  18,653.  3,435 words of progress.

20:58.  18,658.  3,440 words of progress.

21:20.  I didn't work steadily between the last two time points, obviously.  I got distracted talking to someone, then watching part of an anime episode.
