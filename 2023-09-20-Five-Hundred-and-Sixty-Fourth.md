9:40.  I got up a few minutes after 9:00 and lost track of time without *doing* anything.

11:23.  Finished with morning stuff.  Ugh.  I don't want to write.  I'm trying to decide between more Starfield and going across town to the imported goods store to check their candy stock.  I think I'm up-to-date on the candy stock of the imported goods store.

11:28.  There are a couple of interesting items at the import store.  It's exercise, I think I'll go do that instead of playing Starfield.  I'll bring a book and get some reading done along the walk.

15:57.  I took a book along and read a lot of it while on the walk.  Like wow.  That was a good walk.  I used to read while walking when I was a kid, and I read a lot.  I bought a bag of candy at the import store, and when I got back I played Starfield for half an hour.  Then I did...  I'm not sure.  Social media, I guess?  Social media passes time without feeling like doing anything.  It's kinda bad for my self-esteem to do things that don't feel like doing something.  Starfield isn't good for my self-esteem, but social media may even be a bit worse.  That's painful, because I kinda need social media.  I need to build up friendships in order to prosper as an author.

16:29.  I talked myself into some more social media engagement.  Forum posting on Royal Road.  Maybe that'll draw someone new into looking at my stories.  If I were really good at being a forumite, that would be free advertising.  Unfortunately, I'm not really good at it.
