9:40.  I got up a few minutes after 9:00 and lost track of time without *doing* anything.

11:23.  Finished with morning stuff.  Ugh.  I don't want to write.  I'm trying to decide between more Starfield and going across town to the imported goods store to check their candy stock.  I think I'm up-to-date on the candy stock of the imported goods store.

11:28.  There are a couple of interesting items at the import store.  It's exercise, I think I'll go do that instead of playing Starfield.  I'll bring a book and get some reading done along the walk.

15:57.  I took a book along and read a lot of it while on the walk.  Like wow.  That was a good walk.  I used to read while walking when I was a kid, and I read a lot.  I bought a bag of candy at the import store, and when I got back I played Starfield for half an hour.  Then I did...  I'm not sure.  Social media, I guess?  Social media passes time without feeling like doing anything.  It's kinda bad for my self-esteem to do things that don't feel like doing something.  Starfield isn't good for my self-esteem, but social media may even be a bit worse.  That's painful, because I kinda need social media.  I need to build up friendships in order to prosper as an author.

16:29.  I talked myself into some more social media engagement.  Forum posting on Royal Road.  Maybe that'll draw someone new into looking at my stories.  If I were really good at being a forumite, that would be free advertising.  Unfortunately, I'm not really good at it.

16:34.  I want to write, and I just have no ideas.  Like.  The story to this point is good.  It's set up a thrilling question to make the reader want to keep reading.  And...  and nothing.

16:38.  It's just so tempting to shove off writing and be like, "Nope, nothing.  Today isn't the day."  But the idea is that every day should be the day.  I have a relatively low quota intended to promote the idea of absolutely daily productivity.  And I just don't know how to answer the cliff-hanger.  It's hard to focus on without...  *focusing* on it.  It's improbable to just do something else expecting inspiration to strike.  I've found that it generally doesn't.  Inspiration strikes while staring down my story.  It's not something I can count on to interrupt other activities.

16:42.  I just weighed myself.  212 pounds.  My weight spiked from a few days of eating, but then came down quickly from a few days of fasting.  It's obvious at this weight that if I seriously complete a new fasting record, I'll set a new low weight.  It's so tempting to say, "My productivity this week is fasting."  Like, "It's an investment in my health.  I'll gain more than a week of extra lifespan from this."  Is that true?  It's a thought.  I don't know if it's true.

16:55.  It's amazing how long I can spend catching up on messages on social media sites.

16:56.  I give up.  I'm going to log another half hour on Starfield.

(This part added the next day.)  I witlessly started the treadmill again, so these figures are slightly inflated, and by contrast the next day's numbers will be slightly reduced.  8.6 miles.  1,402 kcal.  28,966 steps.  5 hours, 45 minutes, 3 seconds.  Average speed 1.5 mph.
