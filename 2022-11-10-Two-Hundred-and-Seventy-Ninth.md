I'm starting the day on a fresh file, so measuring my productivity will be really easy again.

Oop.  I want to edit the previous file again.  So it's at 5439 words...  What?!  I added a paragraph, and now it's at 5394 words.  Something happened to this file.  There's no way that I deleted more words than I added.  Argh.  This is too long a file!  I wish I had a backup of it.  I have reread it, and it still seems no shorter than it was.  I deleted a sentence, added a paragraph, and somehow the word count went down.  I've added a little more to the file and it stands at 5,405 words.  I'm going to retally the whole project.

The project stands at 21,657 words.  Less the existing 4,589 words that already existed, my nanowrimo contribution is 17,068 words.  Less the 36 words in the new file I made, that's 17,032.  That's 59 words less than I've reported on the nanowrimo website, which tracks with how much I feel I've added to the file, because the reporting anomaly on the nanowrimo website was just north of a hundred words when I checked it before starting.  I must have made a reporting error when I reported 5,439 words.  Maybe the file actually stood at 5,339 words instead.

I'd like to work the file to about 1,900 words today, and then update it on Nanowrimo with my total word count rather than my session word count.  That'll dissipate the anomaly on the reporting.  I'm going to assume I wrote nothing on the 5k file and start from scratch on the new file, so I've thus far written...  36 words.  1,864 to go.

1,234 words.  666 to go.  Wow, 1,234 is 666 from 1,900!
