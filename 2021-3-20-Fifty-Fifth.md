#2021-3-20-Fifty-Fifth

Starting the day with another peanut butter cookie, and making sure I open a day post promptly.  As strange as it is to have breakfast while fasting, it's in my plans and my diet.

I've really woken up thinking about how in my private life, people only seemed to reject me for "only wanting sex" literally when I refused to have anything further to do with sex, and after I'd spent years being broken depressed by meeting sexual desires that I didn't want to meet.

If other people had all along been faking sexuality to meet "my" needs?  I didn't ask for them to do that, they didn't tell me they were doing that, and I wasn't responsible for their decision to do it.

We need a Glasswall Grid.  Old liberalism knew that mercy in light was the key to success, like I do.  LGBT rights didn't advance in stealth and secrecy.  It advanced in openness and compassion, through charitable organization and service to others.  It wasn't an intrinsically altruistic campaign and it didn't need to be; "charitable organization and service to others" doesn't preclude hedonism and it never did.

When I read [[the-ethical-slut|The Ethical Slut]], one of the things that wowed me was that it asserted something which was never part of *my* life: that integrity matters in sexuality.  That's so true.  For years I had been disallowed to protest any dishonesty, but I understand now that's because I was mired in a rape culture that didn't respect my right to say no.  The only people who need to be dishonest in sexuality are rapists, and we need better than a rape culture.

When sex positivity is honest, it expands and strengthens in society.  Love grows where pleasure and honesty are shared together.

This is different.  Kistaro has asked me to stop fasting because I seem too exhausted today.  Specifically, calling off tomorrow's fast was requested.

I'm not too hard to convince.  The hardest part for me is being like, "Why tomorrow?"  I didn't actually ask that, because I don't urgently need more energy today for anything.  I'll have plenty of work to do tomorrow, but I can just keep being exhausted now.

I asked "Why tomorrow?" and Kistaro explained that switching my 'off' days generally was requested so that I'd be more energetic on the weekends.  This was initially proposed as Friday-Saturday, but I pointed out that I have tests on Sunday and eating then could have the biggest impact on my productivity, so we've decided to move my 'feasting' days to Saturday and Sunday.  At least while my coursework continues to assign tests on Sunday, I will take to eating only on weekends, and fasting during weekdays.

---
Is this going to result in my having only one day off from fasting this week?  ...no way.  I've been saving a Nerds Rope from Valentines' day, and I'm going to eat it.

I'll eat some Huel soup, too.

There have always been anomalies in my life, but the biggest one is that, I don't think the world I grew up in exists anymore.  This is always true for everyone eventually, but in my case the maps of the area where I grew up don't even look the same.  The towns have been shuffled around.  Human societies don't redevelop that way, that fast.  I feel like a refugee from a slightly different Earth.

I think I'm grateful.  The world I grew up in was awful.  This one, I don't know as much about.  Although I guess as an outsider, I should be humbler about trying to change everything... well, I think that I would be, if I really believed that I came from a different Earth.

Atheism doesn't offer much of that.  I have to assume that my experiences were real, and all that really happened is I forgot the shape of a map.  From that perspective, I do not want to leave much of this world unchanged.  I grew up in an awful world.

We order out too much here.  I know it.  I love it!  I can't cook, but I love food.  That's where my love of processed food comes in; it exemplifies efficient service to people whose talents lie elsewhere.  I really don't think it'll all be unhealthy forever.  Mm, I'm off topic.

I'm looking over food options trying to decide what to order for brunch tomorrow.  Kistaro wants red meat.  I didn't come into the question with any very strong preference, but immediately upon looking at one of the food ordering apps, it recommended to me a place that sells fried chicken livers, fried chicken gizzards, and fried okra.  That's three things I want.  There aren't many restaurants in the area that I know sells organ meats!  That's what *I* want.  That said, Kistaro's preference is probably going to be overriding here; ordering a half pound of fried chicken livers is going to have to wait for a different week.

There's another restaurant in the area that sells steak and kidney pie, which is another favorite of mine.  I may recommend it tomorrow.  I can live without meat, but...  when I do eat meat, I don't know why people always prize pure muscle tissue so much.  The really flavorful meats are in the organs.

I wonder if anywhere in the area sells beef liver served with onions.  I wonder how many centuries will pass before someone invents a vegan chicken liver substitute!  ...I wonder if I'd like haggis.

There's also a local restaurant that'll sell me a peanut butter bacon burger on a pretzel bun.  I'm not sure that's a good idea, but maybe I'll try it tomorrow.  It's been way too long since I last ate a pretzel bun.
