The first time I drank alcohol, it tasted terrible.  It was hard to understand how anyone would drink.  I pushed through that, and eventually I developed a tolerance for it, then a taste for it.  It tasted...  okay.  Not great, but it no longer was an awful flaw to other flavors.

I dipped a marshmallow in my peppermint liquor to try that, too.  Both the cherry liquor and the peppermint liquor taste the same kind of 'bad' to me.  It's not just one or the other.  Alcohol once more tastes like it tasted the first time I had any, which is bad.  I don't want that flavor in my mouth.

Now my attempts to acquire alcohols to cook with are running into the problem that alcohol is back to tasting like an awful flaw again.  I'm starting to think that I should try using cherry concentrates for flavoring, instead of cherry liquor.  I have yet to spot cherry concentrate at the store.  Is there some technique to cooking off alcohol?  I've heard of the phrase 'cooking off alcohol' before, so I'll look it up.

It won't use up my stock, but before I acquired cherry liquor, Kistaro recommended boiling cherry juice to concentrate it for use as a flavoring.  I might try that.  Ideally, I would want a non-water-based cherry flavoring for candy-making, which is why I had thought that alcohol would be preferable to boiled-down cherry juice.

In other news, I also have those food-grade waxes I bought.  I have some dreadful waxy sweets in the freezer that are more likely to get thrown out than eaten, yet I still see potential in this ingredient.

Specifically, I'm thinking about packing mungbeans into a tablet shape and then pouring wax over them.  I'm not sure anyone else would want them, but I think I would.

Pouring is a good enough strategy for initial experimentation, but since I don't want to block up my intestines by eating too much wax, I'm considering if I can produce edible wax films.  Melting those onto the mung tablets with a heat gun would minimize the digestive side effects of my wax tablet mungbeans.

Mung tabs!

I've been playing the demo for The Fermi Paradox heavily lately.  I like that it (unlike The Viceroy) doesn't tie technology, wealth, and population together so much.  The utopian horse species in the Fermi Paradox is small and has growth problems.  That is so much more appealing!

I'm properly studying for my last tests today... and I have been progressing on that, I swear.  Yet here I'm going to post again on another adventure in cooking, because while taking one of my excessively-numbered breaks from studying, I prepped a prototype beeswax-encased sweet from a container of chyawanprash I recently acquired.

Unlike a lot of my prototypes, it worked!  For flavor.  The flavor worked; it was a delicious piece of candy.  The beeswax casing, I clearly need to figure out how to do better.  Most of all, I think I need to innovate on my tools.  If I could produce thin flat sheets of beeswax, I could cut it apart into little squares, sandwich the chyawanprash between them, and then melt the beeswax with a heat gun to seal up around them.

I'm not sure how to produce thin flat sheets of beeswax, but that seems like a doable thing.
