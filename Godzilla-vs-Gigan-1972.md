More of Anguirrus!  Anguirrus in a heroic role!  There was even a scene of Anguirrus and Godzilla talking to each other!  I love this one.

The alien roach shadow reveal was lame, though.  So's the sawblade belly on Gigan.  The city destroyer shots are some of the worst in the series, and there's so much in the way of questionable shots and reused footage that it seems like Toho's budget was low.

I watched it subbed, for the record.  No, I don't plan to go back and add whether I watched subbed or dubbed versions to the others in the series.  I've already forgotten.

There's good and bad here.
