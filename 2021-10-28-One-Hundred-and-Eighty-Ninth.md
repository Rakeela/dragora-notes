I've been having trouble writing lately.  Indeed, I've been having trouble *reading* lately, since I went into a psychotic state.  My hearing is clogged with harassment for hours every day.  Yet I've been having trouble writing in a more prosaic way that has bothered me many times: my writing lacks a sense of place.

I write without sensation.  I'm like the opposite of a gonzo writer.  My characters are lost in their heads, always.  Like me.  I think that way, sort of.  Wherever I am, I find beauty in what I see... but I don't find words for what I see.  My words are all for other things that I'm thinking about.

So my characters wander in their heads... and I see a sign of why I don't meet people very much.  It's a bit unreal.  I can see it clearly on the page, and wishing alone can't create a wondrous sensorium.  My imaginarium is too empty for the worlds I want to build.  How do I fix that?
