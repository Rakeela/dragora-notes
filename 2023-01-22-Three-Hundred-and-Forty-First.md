So...  I'm trying to write another story.  And the way to get it done is to work steadily.  Day by day.  In the spirit of that...  1,609 words on the file.

Part of keeping insulin response down is eating lightly.  I've seen various guides claim that nut butters are okay on a keto diet.  They're not actually sugarless.  If I ate enough of them, they'd trigger an insulin response, too.  How much is okay?  Is a spoonful okay?  I think it is.  That means eating nut butters is only keto-kosher if I eat them in modest quantities.

I don't think I can bear another week of eating cheese, though.  I ate a small amount of goat gouda just now and I had to rinse my mouth out.  Bleh.  Why does cheese taste so bad?  It's not even the worst I've had...  I need to pick up more bucheron.  That was okay.
