My SO has made several ill-explained references to "hard disk defragmentation" lately.  It's a reminder that I'm not allowed to have an honest social environment, even in private.  I don't think it's necessarily my SO being dishonest either; something improbably weird seems to be at issue in my life.  It's like something cosmic is manipulating people around me in annoying ways that the victims of the manipulation would not give their consent to.  The unknown something cosmic in turn desperately wants me to be more evil than I am so that it can "reciprocate" evil, even though it would also never want to face the reciprocal of its own conduct by something entrapping it and trying to prove that *it* is evil in punishable ways.  Meanwhile, I'm still of the opinion that we should save everyone and seek utility maximization through egalitarian development, culminating in a society of immortals at peace with one another.  As I have been for *more* than twenty years now...  I was a peaceful child, despite everything, and as a dragon I had longed for a more peaceful life.  I got this one... eh...  

My artistic mentor, Mel, gave me the impression of having a fuller form of my own ethics.  I *was* then a person under the impression that loyalty was valuable, though my comfort with the idea had been greatly eroded by mistreatment from other individuals in the dragon community who had sworn loyalty of which they provided none.  Following that, Mel was then the last person who ever tempted me to loyalty, and so much more than anyone ever had before; it was a disaster which only impaired my ability to communicate with others.  I believe I will never do that again, but instead my current intent is that I will remain honestly willing to betray the truth forever now.  Lies can only persist when people let themselves be broken into loyalistic adherence to them.  I greatly prefer documenting my thoughts exhaustively over time and living an unconcealed life.

Obscurantism never advanced science, nor is it reciprocal to my conduct... and I very greatly wish we lived in a fairer world.  I want a world where my willingness to serve others would've gotten me something better than years of sexual abuse.  Sure, I'm back in college now, but with better support I would've gotten back to school faster, and I could've been more support for others.  I found my need for potassium on my own, but I did that years ago now.  The other puzzle pieces were apparently just bupropion and melatonin.  Neither of those are new.  More support from others would've meant faster resolution of my chronobiotic needs, which would've meant that I would already be in my career rather than trying to get started years late.

Unfortunately, I was treated as a desperate slut...  Mel taught me that transhumanism needed cybersexual bonobianism and porn games.  I had always been told by adults in my life, "Wait, things will improve," so I was pretty comfortable trusting that society was going in the right direction.  In humility I was willing to take an extremely peripheral position at the direction of someone so awesomely creative as Mel was.  He made an unpaid prostitute out of me and yet I still really miss him...  I fantasize about him talking to other people to find out where I went and then seeking me out to say, "Hey, I'm the guy you knew as Mel years ago.  I'm sorry I boasted about my contract with Alcor; I'm not actually a wealthy transhumanist, I'm just a guy from Texas.  I'm sorry I pushed you towards bonobian cybersexual services; I think your biotech interests are really a lot more like what transhumanism needs, and I hope you can get involved in science the way you hope to.  I hope you can forgive me."  To which I'd say YES!  But like, I want to tell him, "Okay yes, but it'll be a thousand years before I'll suck your cyberdick again.  And even then I might just buy you an ironic sex toy for Christmas."

I don't know that he's from Texas btw, there was just someone who behaved very weirdly around me who once put up a banner saying something about Texas being in Britain?  I am not intentionally mangling the recounting of that, but my memory doesn't have it flashbulbed.  I can*not* present the story well at this point.  Still, there's some more detail I can mention.  That was someone who I met on NationStates.  I originally made my (last remaining) nation in order to respond to a region invite that he sent me!  But... that guy who shut down his forum in anger because I was participating cheerfully came off like a total authoritarian stalkertrash type.  I hope he wasn't actually Mel.  Though I'd still accept an apology if he was!

Heh.  That guy shouted at me about how everything wasn't just about what makes me comfortable.  And it's like, wow.  When have I in my life been allowed to have what makes me comfortable?  If that *was* Mel, he's up there in the stars at the top of the ranking of people who most should've been respecting my comfort levels more.

I love Mel despite everything because his all-preserving pro-transformative rehabilitation-centric ideals were really good, and his idea of an eternal art-space empowering to the imagination was awesome.  He was one of the people who contributed to my ever-regenerative hedonic setpoint, and even though he caused me a lot of suffering, I think my life was enriched by his presence overall.  I want him to benefit from my research, too.  I want to someday tell the world that I love all the men who helped set me on my path, Mel included.  I know he was big on morphological freedom too, so I want to give him whatever body he wants, though of course that's a very long-term objective...  and I want all of that even though he kind of molested me rather directly, going so far as setting up a creepy childhood roleplaying scenario at the end which was basically the absolute last straw.  I don't think Mel ever detected my discomfort with doing what he wanted, but rather I think he perceived me as a slut eager for more than he wanted to give!  And, well, I wasn't really willing to keep going, because my emotional needs were being so profoundly transgressed that at the end there I felt like Mel was trying to retroactively molest my childhood self.  Which is kosher by simulation ethics, right?  No actual child being hurt by a fiction..?  Just 'working through' something 'necessary'..?

It was appalling.  It didn't even break my loyalty; for years after I praised him unqualified.  Yet I couldn't... be near him.  The thought of making porn for him was just crippling to me.  It hurt.  I wasn't willing.  I described myself as depressed, then.  I took it as the dark twin to 'compulsive positivity' (something I'd described to Mel), just a 'compulsive negativity' that I'd someday get over since after all, writing porn was what my life's ambitions required of me.  It was what transhumanism needed!  Well, I eventually realized that I wasn't willing.  It took a long time for me to realize that where sexual 'compulsive positivity' wasn't something I was feeling all the way to my core, sexual unwillingness *was* something I was feeling all the way down.  It wasn't compulsive negativity.  It was real negativity.  I didn't like it.  I didn't want to be present.

Yet from every nonsexual interaction I had with Mel, and all I saw of the art he contributed to the world, I still adore and miss him.  I think if he'd been more honest to me, and more honest with the way he used the influence he had over me, we'd probably still be friends, and he'd be someone who I'd really want to see grow more prominent in society alongside me.

I wish I'd met more liberal sex-positive people.  I was always *told* that I had the right to refuse sex, but it didn't seem real.  Sex was what I was doing for science and bonobianist pacifism.  Sex was supposed to be the finest possible pleasure, the purpose of life, etc.  It was nearly all cybersexual, but considering my lack of attraction to humans, that's very real to me.  I did a lot of it 'as myself', too.  It took a long time to understand why that hurt so much.  Yet somehow the fact that I was a nervous wreck in nearly all cybersexual encounters only made *almost nobody ever* realize that there was something wrong with *my* consent.  I wish there'd been more of those.  They helped a lot.  Among all the people who stalked my online history looking for ways to sexually use me, I wish at least one of them had considered that there might be something wrong with behaving that way.  Something wrong with sexually "getting away with something", as The Ethical Slut would excoriate.  Sex shouldn't be used abusively.

I never understood the porn games aspect of what was desired of me, either...  I don't think that plan worked.  Most porn games are basically trash.  I think they've even gotten worse, haha.  I studied them for years, because I believed it was important to my work.  I was encouraged to do so.  I tried to force myself to take notes, write scenarios...  I hated it, but I wasn't allowed to hate it.  It was bogus.  Few if any porn games represent anything like an honest liberal sexuality of the kind described in [[the-ethical-slut]].  They're not charismatic.  They spread misinformation and hatred among people, undoing progress in sexual ethics rather than advancing it.  Maybe the inability of anyone to perceive or tolerate such observations was symptomatic of the (lack of) insight in the environment around me at the time.  Anyways though, I was totally supposed to learn programming in order to make porn games.  I wasn't motivated to do that.  I found the prospect disablingly depressing.  Nobody understood my complaints or thought there might be a reason for me to find my life circumstances spectacularly depressing, but instead the people in that environment deemed me stupid, primitive, and a slut.  Just a slut.  Something they could use sexually and discard.

GOD I wish I'd met more liberal sex-positive people.  I'd literally be in the workforce today if I had!

It's the same day, so I can hardly make another post, but I've just realized something.  It's a lot easier to document the things I'm doing when I'm happy with my work.  I hated writing porn.  One of the clues I could conceivably have noticed (though I didn't then know to look for it) was the question of how happy I was to let others see my thoughts in progress.  I have always had subjects where I was happy to be arbitrarily disclosed.  Lots of them!  The fact that I hated showing off any piece of pornographic writing was a clue that should've more intuitively struck me as a hint that I didn't want to be doing the work at all.  I didn't want to publish it.  I'm not ashamed to publish porn, so for years I only thought of myself as wanting to work in privacy.  But if I'd been working with material I didn't hate, it wouldn't have mattered very much.
I wish that the privacy-rapist types who stalked me had been empathetic enough to understand any of what I in hindsight call 'sad whore' characters as the expressions of basic misery they always were.  I never needed privacy, because I didn't act illegally; thinking about how it's felt to dramatically increase my output on topics that I actually enjoy and am uploading immediately, I'm starting to feel less need of privacy in a different sense.
