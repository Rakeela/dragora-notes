#Toy-Story-1995

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Forgotten

I think I've watched this one twice.  I want to say I found it highly memorable, but my memory has degraded to a pile of flashed images, mostly focused on the character of Sid.  The creep-out moment against Sid made me feel bad for him.

I thought the sequels were sad cash-ins.  I only watched one, [[Toy-Story-2-1999]]
