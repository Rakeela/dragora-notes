#Shrek-2001

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I'm surprised I forgot to include this one.  It's highly memorable.  I feel like the Donkey and the Ogre are some grand metaphor reaching beyond the usual attempts of a comedy, but I don't feel like going into it, or much of anything else about this movie.  I'm not the biggest fan of comedies.
