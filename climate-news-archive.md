# Climate News Archive

This is for unsorted links to climate news with headlines, potentially also with commentary.  I also intend to use this category for geo-engineering articles.

Commentary:  I think this concept needs to find more synergies.  For instance, are there ways to suck carbon out of the air with obvious benefits to local environments?  Can these plants be placed so that they are valuable to their localities in addition to the less immediate concerns of global climate?  This also includes siting them so that they are in the immediate proximity of carbon emitters (for maximum absorption) as well as end-users for their synthesized gas (for local economy).  Findng applications that sink carbon will also help make these more useful.  If hydrocarbons captured from the air by carbon-absorping plants could be processed into plastics instead, we would be trapping that absorbed carbon in a form that would not leach into the atmosphere for a very long time.  If a biodegradable plastic is chosen, that carbon can be even be returned to the availability of other biological processes...  carbon rich soils are a carbon sink for the rich vegetation that they sustain.  My intuition, right or wrong (and confessedly not at this time researched) would be that it may be better to process this hydrocarbon input materially for biodegradable plastic production, and then to grow biofuels in the enriched soil.
