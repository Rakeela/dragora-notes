I'm 94.4% done with my wordcount goal for December, and the story is not close enough to its ending.  I'm not 2,000 words from being done.  I'm like 8,000 words or more from being done.  This story will need substantial trimming.  A lot of the words I put into it during Nanowrimo will need to be removed again.
