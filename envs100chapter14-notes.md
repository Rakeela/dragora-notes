# Envs100chapter14 Notes

I haven't started on this, but it's the next segment that I'll need to do for class.  I may as well create the page.

This would be going faster if I used the method I used in chapter 1 of reading and recording my thoughts as I go.  It's strange to think of that as an acceleration strategy.  There's so much more to it than if I could just get a reading trance going and soak the material!  Yet it's so much more interesting to go through line by line writing down thoughts that interest me.  My task focus is much higher if I do it that way.  If 'use a reading trance' isn't working, 'study and author notes' should.

Chapter 14 turns out to be about global warming.  It starts with anecdotes about Miami, which it describes as flooding due to water upwelling from the ocean during exceptionally high tides through porous stone beneath the city.  Miami, it claims, is the city with the largest dollar value of assets at risk from global ocean level increases.  After a number of very basic definitions on what climate, climate change, and global warming are, it starts describing influencing factors.  Here it says that the Earth absorbs 70% of incoming solar radiation, and reflects 30% back out into space.  That is how it describe's the sun as a factor influencing climate.

"Atmospheric gasses having three or more atoms in their molecules tend to absorb infrared radiation." - Noted for chemistry interest.  I wonder if beams of infrared light could be used to sort samples mixed between 2 atom and 3+ atom constitutes.  Purification of O2 samples comes to mind as an application for that if so, since unwanted constituents in an O2 sample are very likely to have greater infrared absorption than O2 molecules.

I think this material could stand to be organized a bit better.  It didn't return as directly to the relevant verbiage as I would have liked, but it appears that the three factors it referred to are the sun, greenhouse gasses, and aerosols.  Greenhouse gasses contribute positively to radiative forcing (defined as "the amount of change in thermal energy that the factor causes"), whereas aerosols may be positive or negative contributors.  It mentions soot particles as an aerosol with positive radiative forcing, and sulfur dioxide as an aerosol with negative radiative forcing.

The total strength of radiative forcing is, per this text, estimated to be 2.3 watts per square meter.  This is the amount of energy that the planet is retaining rather than re-emitting.  It is here claimed that the pre-industrial Earth of 1750 was in balance, emitting as much radiation as it was receiving.  That 'balanced' absorption profile of 1750 would be 340 watts per square meter received and emitted, whereas the presently observed profile is 340.05 watts per square meter received and 337.75 watts per square meter emitted.  The small additional energy input is due to fluctuations in solar output.

"Aside from atmospheric composition, our climate is influenced by cyclical changes in Earth's rotation and orbit, variation in energy released by the sun, absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans, and ocean circulation patterns.  However, scientific data indicate that none of these four natural factors can fully explain the rapid climate change that we are experiencing today." - Now it's talking about four factors?  This could've used a review pass.  Consistent verbiage matters in a pedagogical text.  At least this time the four factors are presented in a list, with subsequent headers describing them.

Looking at the absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans section, I wonder if we could cool the oceans somehow to induce more carbon storage.  It talks about how warming oceans absorb gasses less readily and names this a positive feedback mechanism accelerating warming, which makes me wonder if increasing the availability of cold water on Earth would increase the planet's resistance to greenhouse gasses.  Cooling the oceans is a fairly foolish thought though, as I can't imagine any way to do it besides launching a solar shade.  A solar shade is probably the most materially efficient way to cool an ocean, and it's not because it ranks highly in material efficiency.  There's just so much ocean to try to impact.  Something like that is surely a mega-engineering project any way it's done...

Although, I wonder...  Continuing this digression, ocean currents typically carry heat from the tropics to the colder northern latitudes, right?  I wouldn't want to directly reverse any established current, but I wonder if there stretches of water where the currents are notably not flowing from the tropics with warmer water.  The reason why I'm thinking about this is that I'm wondering if engineering downdrafts in the water column at extreme latitudes could achieve an ocean-cooling effect with less extraordinary investments than a solar shade.  It'd have to be done where it wasn't disrupting the currents carrying heat away from the equator, lest we disrupt the necessary heat transfer away from the equator.  At least in my imagination, accelerating currents would even strengthen the existing oceanic currents against other sources of disruption.  Eh, though...  Thoughts like this make me wish humanity was already a multiplanetary species.  Tampering with major currents sounds like something that could either go very well or significantly impair the habitability of a planet.  For instance, if cooling the ocean through increasing the mobility of colder waters increased heat retention at the equator, it would tend to promote the development of a desert band, which probably isn't good for climate maintenance courtesy of albedo issues and the loss of carbon-sinking biomass.  Alternatively, if current-based cooling didn't promote heat retention at the equator, that could only mean acceleration of heat transfer was occurring instead.  Accelerated heat transfer would increase the intensity of storms.  Ironically, an engineered downdraft installation might even self-wreck by becoming an unusually probable vicinity for extreme storms... which could be desirable itself if it were in fact a controllable occurrence...  No, surely not; accelerated heat transfer would be too much of a diffuse and chaotic instrument.  I love thinking about this stuff, but it'd be a miserable project to try to prove safe.  Even if some method were devised to attempt it, I'm not sure humanity has enough supercomputing power to safely tamper with planetary ocean currents yet.

Which is kind of the problem with climate change, isn't it?  Any truly effective intervention is going to have wide-ranging and unpredictable repercussions.  It's impossible to control the climate if you can't change the climate, but it's very possible to change the climate without being able to control it.  That's about where we are.  Humanity very emphatically can change climates.  We will eventually need to also be able to control climates, and it's not clear that we can do that.  If we change the climate too many times before being able to control the climate, the need to control the climate will intensify.  The intensification of an unmet need tends to be a special kind of unhealthy...

This text mentions fleets of mirrors as a geo-engineering strategy.  It's only talking about it as a means to control albedo, but I find myself wondering about the chaotic implications of weather manipulations.  What happens to local air temperatures around a fleet of mirror on the sea?  Does that region of the sea become cooler as the light is reflected, or does the air warm as solar rays pass through it in both directions?
If mirror fleets create low pressure areas due to lowering local temperatures, dispatching the swarming mirror fleet may be useful for preventative storm-mitigation.  Entering areas of cooler air and water would encourage large storm masses to shed precipitation far from shore.  This sounds like a recipe for drought if misused, but it also sounds like something that would be good for reducing the intensity of very severe weather events such as hurricanes.
Conversely, if mirror fleets bake the sky in solar rays and therefore raise local temperatures, condensing the fleet where there is not evidence of extreme weather activity could be good for promoting gentle regular precipitation in coastal communities.
Intuitively, I would expect mirror fleets to cool the sea and heat the sky, as they are blocking heat absorption in the ocean while twice-baking the local skies.  Cooling the sea has the merit of increasing its carbon absorption power.  However, as with other proposals likely to induce major fluctuations in sea temperatures, the implications for oceanic currents warrant some caution.  Colder waters sink.  Sinking water in a rising-water zone would weaken global currents.  It may be healthiest to use mirror fleets where the water is already quite cold and the local climate is not dependent on rising warm currents.
I think this is all very interesting to think about, but I am struck by the stakes.  We don't have two planets to engineer this way.  The unknowns involve rather vast amounts of energy, and yet inaction is not an option.
