# Envs100chapter14 Notes

I haven't started on this, but it's the next segment that I'll need to do for class.  I may as well create the page.

This would be going faster if I used the method I used in chapter 1 of reading and recording my thoughts as I go.  It's strange to think of that as an acceleration strategy.  There's so much more to it than if I could just get a reading trance going and soak the material!  Yet it's so much more interesting to go through line by line writing down thoughts that interest me.  My task focus is much higher if I do it that way.  If 'use a reading trance' isn't working, 'study and author notes' should.

Chapter 14 turns out to be about global warming.  It starts with anecdotes about Miami, which it describes as flooding due to water upwelling from the ocean during exceptionally high tides through porous stone beneath the city.  Miami, it claims, is the city with the largest dollar value of assets at risk from global ocean level increases.  After a number of very basic definitions on what climate, climate change, and global warming are, it starts describing influencing factors.  Here it says that the Earth absorbs 70% of incoming solar radiation, and reflects 30% back out into space.  That is how it describe's the sun as a factor influencing climate.

"Atmospheric gasses having three or more atoms in their molecules tend to absorb infrared radiation." - Noted for chemistry interest.  I wonder if beams of infrared light could be used to sort samples mixed between 2 atom and 3+ atom constitutes.  Purification of O2 samples comes to mind as an application for that if so, since unwanted constituents in an O2 sample are very likely to have greater infrared absorption than O2 molecules.

I think this material could stand to be organized a bit better.  It didn't return as directly to the relevant verbiage as I would have liked, but it appears that the three factors it referred to are the sun, greenhouse gasses, and aerosols.  Greenhouse gasses contribute positively to radiative forcing (defined as "the amount of change in thermal energy that the factor causes"), whereas aerosols may be positive or negative contributors.  It mentions soot particles as an aerosol with positive radiative forcing, and sulfur dioxide as an aerosol with negative radiative forcing.
