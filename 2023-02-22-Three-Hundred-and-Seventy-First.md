Last week, I ate freely on Saturday, but I only ate breakfast on Sunday.  That seems to have contributed to getting my weight lower this week.  I started my 'fast' a little early.  Having only one day of free eating should also have reduced the conversion of stored carbohydrates into fat.  It's pretty easy to max out glycogen stores in a single day of eating, since AFAIK the body can only store 2,000 calories of glycogen.

Mm!  A dozen handpies that I ordered have arrived, and I have eaten one.  The rest will keep in their boxes.  Truthfully, the handpie ("strawberry and cream" flavor) isn't that good.  That's the thought I had with the last dozen of them that I ordered, and still I ordered again...  Well, I got a different kind this time, and no other appeals to me... or does it?  I could get banana pies next time...  Well, I have used up my calorie budget today with a single item.  The caloric load is not severe, but the insulin spike is the true measure.  This will not be good for my progress.

The last set were "Boston Cream" flavor.  I think I'll eventually have tried all the flavors from this brand that I want to try, and then I'll stop.

Kistaro estimates that each pastry I eat while fasting is equivalent to half a day of extra fasting added to the total duration needed to lose all the weight I intend to lose.  Again, I can eat a pastry in a day within my "fast-simulating" calorie target, but counting calories isn't as important as restraining insulin.
