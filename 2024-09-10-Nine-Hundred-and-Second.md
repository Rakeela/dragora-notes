5:53.  Good morning, daylog.  I slept an hour past my alarm.

8:18.  Something goes well, I want to eat.  Something goes poorly, I want to eat.

9:29.  Oh!  I forgot to mark my start.  New story, working title 'Language Enchantment', 0.  392.

11:16.  414.  Language Enchantment file downgraded to world-building.  Starting a new file, working title 'Thirty'.  0.  505.

13:06.  1,914.  I'm going to go play The Ascent for a bit.  I'm getting close to finishing its content.  I'm not sure what I'll play after it.  Probably Creatures of Ava, but that won't last long.

14:25.  Okay.  I'm a little closer to finishing The Ascent.

14:35.  1,946.  I haven't done anything to the file, I just had a little more progress on it than I'd recorded?  Oh no, I added a little more starting at the 14:25 timepoint.

17:04.  2,643.  2,643 words of progress.

17:13.  10,512.

17:50.  10,574.  I'm going to reread one of my books.  I need to authorize a paperback copy.

19:49.  I am immensely dissatisfied.

20:26.  13.3 miles.  2,184 kcal.  46,662 steps.  9 hours, 1 minute, and 17 seconds.  Average speed 1.5 mph.
