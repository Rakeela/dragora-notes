Starting on a new file.  801 words needed today.

1,060 words on the file.  I got stuck here, and I only just noticed when I went to record the stuck moment that I'm already over quota.

1,109 words on the file.  308 words over quota.  89 words under my average for the month.

In other news, I'm going to attempt a 14 day fast, starting at 6:45 PM on 2022-12-11 and ending at 6:45 PM on 2022-12-25.  Merry Christmas to my waistline.  If I succeed, I'll buy myself a jug of brandy eggnog to celebrate.

14 days will set a new personal record for longest fast.  If I succeed.  Obviously, I can't really do this.  We'll see how it goes.
