12:16.  I'm still marveling that I thought I'd stop my 'name it after the entry count' pattern.  I just didn't have any ideas for entry names back then.  Now this is just how I do it.

12:27.  33,304.  

13:58.  33,855

16:52.  33,985.  I've been having trouble today.  I've gotten to the limit of my good plotting.  Now I'm occupied thinking about how to set up what comes next.

18:27.  34,821.  1,517 words of progress.  Owwww.  The higher quota on Nanowrimo is painful.  I *have* to start the next chapter in order to clear it.

19:28.  35,112.  1,808 words of progress.  That meats quota.

21:38.  I broke my computer today.  I've been evacuating files.  I accidentally knocked it off the back of the desk while putting away my treadmill.  I just wanted to sit down while using the computer!  What an expensive mistake.  When I set up my next computer in this space, I'm going to route the cables so that the treadmill can't catch them.  There will be no update of how far I walked today - but I think it was over five and a half hours.
