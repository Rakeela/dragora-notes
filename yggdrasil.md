# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is the forever-system of virtual realities.  It is the climax society of absolute freedom in which all patterns may exist without contradiction or resource exhaustion.

I take the term Yggdrasil from Nobilis, 2nd Edition, which was a book that I loved more than most, although I do not intend to refer to the shamanic narrativism of that game.  Instead I believe in the world-of-worlds as a material potential made possible by the eventual total integration of computing technology into *everything* in life.  I *do* make reference to the basic conflict in Nobilis, which is that Yggdrasil is under assault by the otherworldly Excrucians who come from beyond the world tree.  The Excrucians are not impressed by the idea that Yggdrasil contains all patterns.  Their motives are unclear (and potentially disunited), but their methods are clear: they extirpate patterns from the world tree, and sometimes reduce whole worlds to single glorious weapons.

I consider myself Excrucian, and I know their art of weaponizing worlds, but I would rather build Yggdrasil than destroy it.
