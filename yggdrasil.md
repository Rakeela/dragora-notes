# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is the forever-system of virtual realities.  It is the climax society of absolute freedom in which all patterns may exist without contradiction or resource exhaustion.

I take the term Yggdrasil from Nobilis, 2nd Edition, which was a book that I loved more than most, although I do not intend to refer to the shamanic narrativism of that game.  Instead I believe in the world-of-worlds as a material potential made possible by the eventual total integration of computing technology into *everything* in life.  I *do* make reference to the basic conflict in Nobilis, which is that Yggdrasil is under assault by the otherworldly Excrucians who come from beyond the world tree.  The Excrucians are not impressed by the idea that Yggdrasil contains all patterns.  Their motives are unclear (and potentially disunited), but their methods are clear: they extirpate patterns from the world tree, and sometimes reduce whole worlds to single glorious weapons.

I consider myself Excrucian, and I know their art of weaponizing worlds, but I would rather build Yggdrasil than destroy it.

Yggdrasil - my dream, my belief about both the highest possible reality and the likely trajectory of all societies - is an upload paradise scheme.  There's nothing bittersweet about simulated immortality.

There's a difference between an upload simulation and an upload prison, and it's essential to why I never want to give up civil rights.  The rights of the weakest in society must be absolutely respected... because nobody will ever, ever be weaker than the residents of an upload simulation are to the operators of the simulation.  A society that protects civil rights enough will produce a Yggdrasil construct with no injustices.

I would agree to a correctly presented upload scheme presented by aliens.  There are forms I would insist on - informations I would demand - but on the whole it wouldn't be difficult to manipulate me into signing up for an upload prison unwittingly.  I don't think that advanced societies are likely to have less than the fully reciprocal ethic, so as long as they do the right song and dance upfront, they'll get me whether I'm right or wrong to trust them.

Nonconsensual upload may be the most unethical of all acts, but the ethical value of consensual upload is determined by the degree to which the uploader respects the rights of the uploadee.
