I weigh 247 pounds, plus or minus two.  My highest weight was 324 pounds, plus or minus two.  I was born overweight and have never had a normal weight in the whole span of my life on Earth.

Due to quirks of my metabolism that I talked about yesterday ([[2021-1-17-twelth]]), the only way I've ever lost weight is by fasting.  All 77 pounds I've lost from my peak weight was due to fasting.  I think given what I discovered yesterday that it may also be possible for me to use a keto diet to lose weight, and I think that's what I'm going to try when I decide that my weight is where it ought to stay.

The last month has been one of my most successful periods of weight loss, and one of my most comfortable periods of weight loss as well.  I've been scheduling on a five-days-fasting, two-days-eating pattern.  My previous successful fasts were on the 12-14 day range, which was much more difficult and exhausting to perform.  Five day fasts are a little easier.  Frequently recurrent five day fasts seem like they're being a productive tool for weight control.

My success has been enabled by tracking my fasting on an app.  Something that infringed my life is that I was treated as primitive and concealment-dependent by people who hurt me badly and then in their desperation to remove me had to invade my life quite comprehensively... all while presenting me as someone whose success would somehow require the removal of other people from this world.  I was faced with this though I have respected the consent of others and the laws of society all my life.  Why do I mention this again here?  My purpose is to present myself as someone who was presented previously in opposition to all data-gathering, all scheduling, and all self-monitoring.  I was presented as someone whose plans are wholly and ineluctably false!

Whereas from my POV, I have consistently held that data-gathering must be made productive to the individual and voluntary in order to proceed stably.  We shouldn't consider it scientific and progressive that we violate civil rights and conceal systems of secret observation throughout our society.  Science is the shared, testable world that is revealed to all!  The idea of science is that people participate in it and are empowered by it not through falsehood, but through open integrity and presenting the world as it is.  The fasting app that I've been using is like that.  It's productive to me and my usage of it is voluntary.  My notes are like that.  They're productive to me and my publishing of them is voluntary.  Nobody has to collect this data illicitly; it's out there in the open!

Everything in society could be like that, but we need to root out some of the people who violate consent in data-gathering.
