11:07.  I'm stuck in inappropriate hunger.  I ate enough already.  I feel unwell.  Eating more would make me more unwell.  I want more food even though it would make me feel unwell.  This isn't egosyntonic.

11:23.  The hunger has eased, but not entirely.  It's still there, upsetting me.

11:29.  I ate a bunch of pecans, btw.  While stuck with the hunger.  I just kept eating pecans.  I wasn't totally abstaining from food.

11:38.  I thought about playing a game, and... uh...  I don't want to.  I want to work on Greeve's Ambition.  91,243.

11:39.  I mixed a liter of cola with amaretto.  I need to avoid buying amaretto, it's really hard for me to use responsibly.

22:36.  Wow, this evening was totally wasted.  I tranced out on a porn game.  I am, like, stuck in my addictions...  No, that's not fair.  I don't believe in porn addictions.  Anyways, most porn games on the market are absurdly bad... and overproduced.  The ones that hold my attention are relatively simple.

22:37.  What's funny is that for hours I meant to be playing a different porn game, and... it would've been 'smarter' material, but...  it wouldn't have been a more productive use of time.

22:38.  I had fun, I guess.  Being in a trance is weird.

22:39.  It's hard to suffer while in a trance.  When life is suffering, trance is tempting.

22:42.  The editing work lately has been really hard.  I've really been trying to pry at my writing and add sensory details.  It's so slow.  My attention doesn't focus very well on the task.

22:44.  12.0 miles.  2,025 kcal.  41,465 steps.  8 hours, 39 minutes, and 2 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.

22:50.  Sometimes I can trance out while writing, but so far I can't trance out while editing.  I can't get so absorbed in the work that everything else falls away.  I think the problem is that I'm consciously testing and checking my writing, so it doesn't trigger that flow of solving problems in a regular way.

23:00.  The potential to go into trance while writing, and just come out of it having written a few thousand words, is one of the draws of writing...
