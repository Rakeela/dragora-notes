An edit has occurred to me for the prior file in Nanowrimo, so let's try take two on editing it.  It's at 5,405 words.  5,405.  5,405.  The overall story is at 23,522 words.

Now the file is at 5,475 words, and the overall story is at 23,592 words.  Seventy and seventy.  All is as it should be.

Next up, the file I left at 1,902 words.

This is hard today.  I'm at 2,405 words and it's just not flowing.  573 words of progress, 1,094 words to go.

2,833 words.  931 words of progress, 736 words to go.
