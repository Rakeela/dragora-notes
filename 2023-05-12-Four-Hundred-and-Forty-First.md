Kistaro took today off of work to play a videogame, "Tears of the Kingdom", the latest Legend of Zelda title.  This one features floating sky islands.  I don't think I'll be playing it, but I'll watch some of it.

14:54.  I've watched "Tears of the Kingdom" for much of the day.  It's a very huge game.  I don't think I'll ever play it.  The time commitment staggers me.  I have books to read, even books to write!

15:01.  I didn't let myself out of my writing quota today, but wow am I distractible.  I'm hungry, too...

15:03.  82,215 words on the file.

15:19.  82,321 words on the file.  106 words of progress.  I have no idea what I'm writing today.

16:42.  82,665 words on the file.  450 words of progress.  I'm having to noodle over a bunch of unimportant characters.

17:07.  82,764 words on the file.  549 words of progress.

17:34.  82,812 words on the file.  597 words of progress.  Argh!  I solved one puzzle and now I don't know what to do next.  I'm filling time in the narrative.  Things have to happen.

17:43.  82,861 words on the file.  646 words of progress.  754 to go.  I'm less than halfway through and I'm so restless.  I can't stop jiggling my leg.  I want to go somewhere.  I want to eat something!  

18:17.  I've bought myself a cheese and mayonaisse dip that I'm just eating straight.

19:10.  83,354 words on the file.  1,139 words of progress.  261 words to go.  Argh!  I got to something that's a natural stopping point.  I also ended up writing something that's a natural cutting room floor candidate.  It illustrates something out of my worldbuilding files, but it's unnecessary, and I don't know how to do it.  Worse, I clearly have to do at least 261 words of it to complete my daily writing quota.  Oh, and P.S. That cheese and mayonaisse dip was hard keto, so I don't feel too bad about it.

20:10.  83,588 words on the file.  1,373 words on the file.  I'm not stuck, not exactly.  I just need to go to the store.  I don't want to buy something.  I want to *look* at something.  A cake.  I have referred to it twice in my writing, and I have not referred to it enough.  My favorite kind of cake is just available at the grocery store.  I need to describe it better this time.

20:58.  83,986 words on the file.  1,771 words on the file.  FInally!
