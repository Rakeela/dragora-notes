8:51.  I'm up.  I've been up for about forty minutes.  I'm stopping my 28 hour fasts in favor of a 24 hour fast pattern.  I'm happier eating breakfast.

17:25.  I've been obsessed today with a roleplaying game that I'm participating in.  I'm more or less at peace with not getting any real work done today, but I have to do better in the future.  Also, I've eaten a bar of sugar-free white chocolate.  It has occurred to me that it literally takes me more discipline to eat lightly during prolonged fasts than it does to eat a large amount once per day.  If I extended my "fasting" with sugar-free chocolate, I should lose more weight than if I continue eating a large meal every day.

17:29.  I have been waiting for an hour and a half for one of the players in this roleplaying game to post.  They're holding back the whole pace of the game.  They were consistently the slowest poster during set-up.

17:30.  Eating lightly is more psychologically healthy than feasting-and-fasting.  Unfortunately, "violating fasts" triggers the brain-hack with which I was targeted, which activates automatically based on electronic inputs on my phone.  I'm convinced this is an actual thing.  It literally misfired once already, too.  My own psychology wouldn't care about electronic inputs on my phone, but an automated observation program would care intensely.

17:32.  Violating fasts triggers an absolutely corrupt "so then eat more!" response that is deeply unhealthy.  It also fires on moments between fasts.  That's why I note that eating lightly is more psychologically healthy.  Light eating defies the "so then eat more!" response that has become overgrown in me.  Feasting and fasting doesn't defy that at all.

17:34.  Anyway.  I was also thinking that I hate the constipation that I get while eating one meal per day.  Eating sugar-free chocolates makes me feel less worried about that.  Also, I was flatulent despite maintaining my usual regimen, so it's like, "Fuck this noise.  If I'm going to be flatulent anyways, I may as well get something for it."

17:41.  I've been abusing caffeine lately.  For a while.  A few weeks, at least.  And I'm going to go have another can of energy drink, my fourth today, but starting tomorrow I think I may enforce a logging requirement on my energy drink consumption.  That'll probably get me to shy back so hard that I don't drink any at all tomorrow, which would sabotage the logging... so I absolutely need to drink at least one... which will fend off most of the withdrawal syndrome, so I should anyways.  If I've been drinking more caffeine and getting more tired, I'm doing it wrong.

17:43.  It would be more healthy

18:01. Oops.  I got distracted (by the roleplaying game).  I think I was saying...  It would be more healthy to eat another sugar-free chocolate bar tomorrow morning rather than my usual between-fasts meal.  I don't know if I'll *do* it, but it would be healthier.  On that note, I'm gonna compost the chocolate pinwheels I've got out.  They're okay, but they're not great, and I don't need to eat them.  If I'm going to eat sugar, it ought to be excellent, because the low-grade stuff is just as unhealthy.
