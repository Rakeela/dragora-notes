#2022-01-31-Two-Hundred-and-Twenty-Fifth

My post yesterday about fasting ([[2022-01-30-Two-Hundred-and-Twenty-Fourth]]) was related to my habit of weekly fasting.  I don't do it "honestly".  I cheat on all my fasts.  I hate that word "cheat" here, even.  I'm not fasting and praying.  I'm fasting to feast on the weekends.  I'm cutting back my food consumption so sharply during the week that I don't gain weight if I eat a fistful of candy on Saturday and an oversized restaurant meal on Sunday.

If I do this and skip the feast, I even lose weight.  Which I should do.  I'm kind of posting about that today.  My weight is up.

Apropos of nothing, I really wanted to be a porn writer, years ago.  I still see good porn as a basic service and culturally essential.  Society should be polite to pornographers.

Also apropos of nothing, I've never volunteered as an alien ambassador.  I *would* volunteer, if I got the opportunity, *but I have not done it*.  No such opportunity has arisen.  I don't believe in aliens primitive enough to conscript involuntary ambassadors.

And I am still an atheist antinatalist.
