7:10.  As I planned yesterday, today I used Liberal Crime Squad to overcome the morning sleepiness that has plagued me lately.  I have yet to do my usual morning things online - Nationstates and Flight Rising - but I should be able to make an earlier start today at writing.

7:32.  Flight Rising had a very enervating effect.

8:13.  Done with Nationstates.  I feel pretty unalert, I'm going to play a bit more LCS.

9:06.  I didn't really want to stop, but I'd decided that I'd stop at 9:00, so when my alarm went off to mark the hour, I stopped.

9:09.  Argh.  I don't want to write this morning.  But I can write, so I should write.  30,411 words on the file.

9:11.  One of my acquaintances is mawkish and cryptic.  They collect sounds and associate them with personal characters, creating personal (scavenged) voice packs to give voice to those characters.

9:26.  They develop these attachments to videogame characters, seeing in them avatars of nature and of said personal characters.  It's a passionate pattern, but an erratic one.

10:10.  Credit 147 words editing to Greeve's Ambition.  30,398.

12:05.  31,747.  1,336 words of progress.  What is with me lately and checking in with not-quite quota?  Well anyways, I'm going to take a break now.  I want to visit the store and check the overstock section of the bakery for my favorite cookies.

16:44.  How long did I just play LCS?  What a marathon session.  That game leads to a desperation to find the secrets of others.  It's so important to expose the secrets of others in that game.

17:17.  I'm still thinking about LCS rather than writing.  I just won the game by thievery and save-scumming.  It can also be won, and probably with less save-scumming, by a whole lot of graffiti tagging.

17:25.  LCS has combat features that are generally unnecessary.  It's best to avoid fights in the game.  Disguises work really well... with the relevant skill.  Stealth works pretty well, likewise with the relevant skill.  But beyond that, if it weren't for features like the Conservative Crime Squad, you could win the game entirely by peaceful pressure via writing campaigns.

17:29.  The CCS necessitates developing one of the following:  1) a thief/hacker character to hack the CIA mainframe and extract the CCS backer list, 2) a network of very advanced seducers who can turn CCS members and identify their safehouses, or 3) a brainwasher character who can turn CCS members by 'enhanced techniques' and identify their safehouses.  Either of the safehouse-identification methods supposedly require defeating the safehouse's boss, but I suspect that you can also defeat the safehouses by graffiti-tagging them.  I haven't tried it.

17:33.  These thoughts are totally useless in my writing.  I just spent a while deeply absorbed in something that doesn't help me write at all.  I don't like doing that.

18:19.  31,869.  1,471 words of progress.

18:35.  I like LCS, but I don't know how to play that *and* be productive as a writer.  It's such a different and more unpleasant headspace.

18:39.  I can work with Cultist Simulator's headspace, but I'm not eager to be like, "Oh, I messed up my inspiration with one game, let's remedy it with STILL MORE GAMING."  I'll play Cultist Simulator tomorrow.  I might be making the wrong decision and losing a bit of productivity tonight.
