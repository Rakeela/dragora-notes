While out on a walk today, I thought of a fun exercise facility.  Tracked bike machines!  Literally bike machines attached to tracks, so that people propel the machines forward as they pedal.  These could be used for racing.  In space-constrained settings, they could be built using virtual reality headsets and attached fans (to simulate wind from moving quickly), and they could *still* be used for racing.

In zero-G, they could be built with complex tracks that use the microgravity environment to do disorienting things, which would also be useful for creating handicap lanes to allow good cyclists to compete "fairly" with worse cyclists.  Imagine if the novice cyclist got a straight route, and the handicap lane twisted *all the way around them*.  It would give literal meaning to the boast, "I could bike circles around you!"
