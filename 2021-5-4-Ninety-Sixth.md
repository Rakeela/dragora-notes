#2021-5-4-Ninety-Sixth

I'm so tired again today.  I feel like I'm trying to carry the world.  Implausibly.  Irrationally.  I'm under very little demand and I feel like this.  I feel like there exists an intangible burden that I'm barely able to lift, and I *have* to lift it, because other people are being crushed by the same burden, and if I can lift it long enough I can spare all of them.  Yet I don't know what the burden is, exactly.  It feels like the hatred of others, the rude insistence that I fail for no particular reason, and the demand that my attempts to help people by promoting medical investment should be unimportant and irrelevant.  I "did nothing" and therefore "deserve" to fail, even though I burned myself out doing what I was supposed to be doing, and have done so several times in my life.

I wish I could cry.

Occasionally I can.  I feel better when I do.  It's like there's something that I approach sometimes, which lifts the sense of brainless self-fulfilling hatred.  It lifts the sense of an enraged claw-down hostility trying to destroy me for the sin of thinking that people should be protected and rejuvenated.

Unfortunately, both the hatred and the occasional relief of it seem linked somehow to the idea that nobody is allowed to value life enough to oppose natalism.  THAT is the sin which is to be targeted for unlimited hatred.  Love is to be a lie, or else!  There is to be no love, only fecundity!  Lisa Montgomery had four children and was an apex human being, her father a saint to be emulated!

Love is not measured by fecundity.

I will not reproduce on Earth.  I am conceptually reluctant to reproduction, period; I am aware that I cannot have the consent of the unborn save by exact replication of someone who exists already.  Nor do I mean cloning, but rather I mean *branching*.  In that manner alone could reproduction proceed with no chance of violating someone's consent.  Otherwise, it's a probabilistic gamble that cannot be proven to never have a victim.

Under sufficiently perfected conditions, I would take that gamble.  Primarily, my condition is habitation in orbit, on an asteroid, or on a low-gravity barren world.
