7:49.  I woke up at 5:50 this morning and I was fairly well awake at the time (so it seemed).  I woke up thinking about some story that I'd been thinking about in my sleep beforehand.  I laid awake in bed continuing it as best as I could until I felt quite awake, and I was sure I'd remember it later.  I do not.  The only fragment that I now recall is that there was something about exploring a vast (corporate?) campus where all the hallways matched the technology level of the main rooms to which they were attached.  Off to one side of the campus was a building with a tremendously high tech level, and situated high up in that building was the corporate entertainment room, intended not for casual breaks but for employee events.  It was full of extremely advanced entertainment equipment.  I didn't actually go into it during the story, so I have no thoughts to have forgotten about what extremely advanced entertainment equipment would be constituted of.

8:03.  I think I need to be setting up my 1,400 word daily quota on Kura and Kaire.  I want to get it doooooone.  One of my ideas is that I should try to build up my renown by taking "a lot of bites at the apple" - trying different things, putting out more books rather than fewer.  Kura and Kaire is very different from my Theoma series and could draw a different audience.

8:08.  1,521 words on the chapter.  Reviewing.  Potentially expanding.  This chapter is lightweight.

8:17.  66,158 words on the file.  I should also track the expansion of the file as new words, since I'm intending to add material rather than subtract it.

8:18.  66,210 words on the file.  52 words progress.  This isn't really new material in the last minute, I just only thought to start recording my progress.

8:22.  Ugh.  I still no longer appreciate the system in Kura and Kaire.  I still want to convert it to an effort-based system where stats and skills increase as they are used.

8:31.  The urge to recompile Tekhnevia's system is very strong.  Right now, Tekhnevia's underlying system is based on the system of [[Vainqueur-the-Dragon]].  I want to recompile it to be based on Erryn's World (aka [[The-Unbound-Soul]]) instead.  I didn't exactly use the Vainqueur system and I wouldn't exactly use the Erryn's World system.  I need to study Kura and Kaire again to redecide whether I can recompile it.

8:34.  Huh.  I don't remember why I abandoned Draft A3.

11:09.  I have already walked more than four hours.  Also, I'm working on a file with 1,404 words.  It started with 316 words.  That's 1,088 words of progress.

11:49.  1,654 words on the file.  1,338 words of progress.  Almost 1,400.  Hm.  This chapter is still a little light.  Maybe I should further extend it, with the goal of ending it between 2,500 and 3,000 words.  I could do with more practice at targeting word counts.

12:54.  2,681 words on the file.  2,365 words of progress.  Chapter 1 complete on Draft B2.  I've started rewriting the story with a new system behind Tekhnevia.

14:24.  It's so tempting to eat more.  My weight is dropping pretty fast.  It's the starting stages of food restriction, when some of the weight melts right off.  The real weight loss happens later on.  I'm 45 hours in.  I've marked this 'fast' (actually diet) for 351 hours.  I may cut it off around the 300 mark again if I start getting faint.  I'm not sure what would have caused that, nutritionally speaking.

14:26.  I'm going to go to a local bakery and buy some quiche to eat tomorrow instead of a cookie.  Quiche is much healthier.  The cookies will hardly go to waste.

15:17.  I bought a pistachio eclair instead of a quiche.  I couldn't resist the little handwritten sign on it.  That made it look like a limited time, nonstandard menu item, so I wanted to grab it while I would get the chance to try something I haven't had before.

19:41.  Starting work on a prologue for Kura and Kaire.

20:35.  3,335 words on the file.  3,019 words of progress.

21:45.  3,950 words on the file.  3,634 words of progress.  I'll add in the 52 from work on the other draft.  I did 3,686 words today.  BTW, I renumbered my drafts.  A3 became B1, and I'm now working on draft B2.

21:46.  11.1 miles.  1,958 kcal.  39,606 steps.  8 hours, 46 minutes, 12 seconds.  Average speed not recorded (the OS for my treadmill crashed as I was checking it).
