I found a way described to lower leptin levels: sleep less.  So with this bad influence in mind, I cut off my night's sleep after five hours.  Also in the category of recent bad ideas, I bought a donut from the Haggen in Woodinville yesterday.  I ate that for breakfast today.  It was delicious, yet somehow unsatisfying.

Morning weigh-in:  247.9 pounds.

Twenty minutes later, I kinda feel like I ate a donut.  Why do I like sweets so much if they don't make me feel good?

I'm bored.  I have stuff to work on, but I haven't been able to turn my focus to it.  I guess I'll do dishes.  And laundry.  Thanks to the miracle of modern consumer goods, neither takes much time.  Now what?

I know, let's self-weigh again!  249.3 pounds.  It's kinda disconcerting to know I've drank 1.4 pounds in fluids.  My urine is usually clear.  I don't get thirsty.  I just drink habitually.

Despite drinking a huge amount of caffeine, I ended up sleeping on the couch.  Extending my morning by getting up earlier did not work... mostly.  I guess I did get a little farther into basic chores.

Sigh.  I want more sugar.

I had a thought that I want to record.  "Misinformation promotes rudeness."  It's an indirect causality.  People feel strongly about what they believe to be true.  When misinformation exists in a population, it increases the rate at which different people will feel strongly about truth-beliefs.  Some of those people will be rude to each other even though they would have been polite to one another if they agreed about what is true.

Evening weigh-in:  246.0 pounds.  I guess I can still lose weight on a day I ate a donut.
