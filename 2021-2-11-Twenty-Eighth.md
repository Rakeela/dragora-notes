I woke up today without feeling hungry.  Yesterday, I ate a slice of cake and I was satisfied for hours.  The concept of a sweet food being satisfying to hunger was surprising and novel.  Waking up without hunger was surprising and novel.  I would infer that my 5-2 fasting schedule has brought me past some threshold which adjusts the functioning of my metabolism.  I expect that this means I have leptin sensitivity again.

Historically, I've known three basic hunger states.  Hungry, overfull, and hungry but too busy doing something else to eat (ie, distracted from hunger).  Being overfull is unpleasant, but so is being hungry.  Switching which kind of unpleasantness is applying feels better than being stuck hungry all the time, which fueled my historic feasting-and-fasting preference for periods of not eating interspersed with periods of eating too much.  I'm not going to immediately switch away from that pattern, as I've found a productive variation of it and I have more to accomplish with it.  I'll keep thinking about it.

I wonder if someone were injected with synthetic IgG antibodies for leptin.  Would it pull enough circulating leptin out of their system for their body to resensitize?  How about with a course of such treatments?  I wouldn't want to create a permanent leptin autoimmune target, but I think the immunoglobin G alone would only mark leptin molecules for phagocytosis by neutrophils.

I've lost about eighty five pounds from my peak weight so far.  If I'm right that my leptin sensitivity has returned, that's what it took.  The semipermanent hunger state emphasizes that the challenge with obesity is that, once established, it's inclined to worsen.  I think better treatments need to be invented for this.  People don't need 'the will' to stay thin.  What they need is a biochemical state that makes their weight subject to effective homeostatic regulation.

Given the extremes of obsessive hatred that people fall into over obesity and the common taboo on defending the emotional safety of obese people, I think society needs some kind of institutional support for this.  Ambient fat hatred makes weight loss from something emotionally rewarding into something emotionally punishing, because people hate doing what hateful people tell them to do.  Fat hatred is societally obesogenic due to emotional resistance.  Submitting to a society in which fat hatred is an unchallengeable obligation is very much part of how America submitted to a society with widespread obesity.  More insulation and support is necessary than most people can access.  I still think that subsidizing fasting clinics would be good preventative healthcare, and if there were good medical treatments invented, that would also provide an environment where those treatments could be made available.

The 'disease of rudeness' factor in obesity points up the unfairness of life, because the people who get fat in a rude society aren't necessarily the people who are rude in a rude society.  Yet people who hate fat people hate *looking* at them, so the rational full expression of their preferences would still involve quelling their rudeness programming in preference to the world they'd rather live in.  Unfortunately, rude people can't exert self-control; I called it 'programming' because I understand rudeness to be a basket of compulsive and automatic behaviors over which individuals have no control, even when the expression of rudeness is undermining their objectives.  This kind of thing makes me interested in resolving neuroinflammatory conditions...  Maybe if their brains were operating under less stress, rude people would regain their autonomy.

Thought debris; do choppy seas disrupt cloud formation by disrupting the 'smooth, flat' character of the ocean, providing a regulatory feedback mechanism on the operation of large weather systems?  If air masses form best in large, flat areas of similar temperatures, the semblance of the sea to such a place would be broken up by the kind of weather conditions which promote the formation of the largest waves.

Could a heated artificial lake be used to increase snowfall where doing so is climactically favorable, as to regenerate a glacier or icy shelf?  This could be used to mitigate sea level rises and increase reflective albedo, so it may be worth calculating the energy expense involved.  I seem to recall reading that there was a foolish idea of using nuclear reactors to terraform the arctic in 50's futurism.  Well, it turns out we would rather keep the arctic nice and cold, but there may still be a use for a few underwater nuclear reactors in this cooling scheme...

I'm mostly working on studying classwork today.  The geoengineering thoughts are inspired by studying the meteorology textbook.  I am going to keep and treasure this textbook.  I'm glad I bought my own copy rather than renting one.
