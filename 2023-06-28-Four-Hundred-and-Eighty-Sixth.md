11:12.  I woke up at a decent time, but it's taken me this long to get going.  Part of the problem was that I was feeling bad about the depletion of my #Candy-Vault, so I went on a candy-shopping run to a local store with a good candy supply.  I added a little more candy this time and a little less chocolate, but I did add three more of one of my favourite chocolate bars (the Seattle Chocolates Carrot Cake bars),  as well as two more Seattle Chocolates bars that I think I don't like (Sip Sip Hooray and Wafer Cone).  I want to get those properly measured and put into the Hall of Shame if they're not up to my tastes.

11:16.  A gryphon author friend of mine has bugged me to do more with gryphons.  Taltios' Travelogue is gryphony, but I'm going to do an editing pass on Kura and Kaire instead.

12:26.  I got hungry.  I ate.  I got hungry again.  I thought, "If I eat again, I'm going to feel unwell."  I made myself wait.  Now, without having eaten again, I feel overfull.

13:10.  I have been unable to focus on writing so far today.  I set myself the task of editing Kura and Kaire, and I created a new draft file for it, but...  Ugh.  I can't do it.  I don't know what's giving me so much trouble.  It needs a pruning pass.  All of my work needs a pruning pass before it's ready, and Kura and Kaire is due for one.  I'm going to play a little bit of Cultist Simulator.  This game helps more than it hurts, I think.

14:26.  Cultist Simulator is a fantasy of painting, to me.  It's always "One more painting.  One more painting."  I long to be someone who can paint.

14:52.  I am not getting anything done in my writing today.

15:32.  Today really feels like summer.  I just went for a walk, ate something, came back, ate several tartlets and a pack of cookie dough bites, and now I feel overheated.

15:36.  There was a hatred of excess verbiage that I channelled before, wasn't there?  It's just a void now.  I can't get it together to dig into Kura and Kaire with the pruning mindset.  I feel like I can't identify adverbs well enough.

16:55.  Credit 6,737 words of editing.

18:15.  I played a bit more Cultist Simulator.  I kinda feel like I've moved beyond it.  I came up with my own incomplete variant lore.  Playing their version doesn't help me with mine.  It just... I dunno, makes me want to read spirituality books until I can fabricate weird religions for my stories.

18:16.  God, I can't regulate my temperature today.  Too cold now.  Been too hot or too cold all day.

18:22.  I've got a book of Christian sermons to read. "Thirsting for the Springs" by John Henry Jowett.  Originally published 1903.

18:31.  This is giving me ideas for the next region of Taltios' Travelogue.  32,971 words on the file.  Today will not be a day for the quota unless I surprise myself, but I will write a little.

20:23.  34,432.  1,461 words of progress.  I'm feeling a bit stalled out, and I did actually hit the quota, I wonder if I should stop.  I'm likely to have fresh ideas if I return to the writing tomorrow.

21:53.  35,170.  2,236 words on the chapter.  2,199 words of progress.
