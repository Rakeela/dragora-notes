I'm presently reading "The Ecology of Commerce", by Paul Hawken.  On page 17, there's a claim sourced to "Ivan Illich" which states that the average American spends 1600 hours per year working with their vehicle, attaining therefore an average speed of five miles per hour.  This includes maintenance, driving, and *working to pay for it*, which last inclusion I'm not sure is fair.  The book's conclusion that there's something absurd about this doesn't really hold, but taking it seriously for a moment longer, I do see more than one answer.  That velocity could be increased in that calculation by making the car cheaper to use, easier to maintain, or faster in operation.

I think self-driving cars will make cars faster in operation and easier to maintain.  I think in the long-term, they will also make cars cheaper to use, though not initially.  The reason why is that I believe that as more cars become self-driving, crash rates and associated expenses + traffic snarls will become increasingly rare, even as automated load-balancing solutions are implemented to resolve traffic congestion.  Car use patterns can become more mappable and predictable without any decrease in individual autonomy of operation.

I wish I could say, "And the conversion to electric will also make cars cheaper by switching from an expensive fuel to a cheaper one," but I don't know that.  The impression I have is still that the world is short on rare earths relative to what would be necessary to build all the required batteries with current technology.

Humanity has a bright future, but I hope our governments can remain uncorrupted for long enough.  Tech uptake is only properly enthusiastic when the public's rights are protected.  A public without its rights assured against authoritarianism is a public rightly suspicious that all technologies are tools of control.
