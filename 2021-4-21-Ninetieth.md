Mung gels: probably beyond my skill.  The finely ground mung bean is not a soluble ingredient.  It did not suspend in water.  Every transfer step bled mung bean.  The result looks terrible and I'm scared to taste it.

On the plus side, monksfruit powder looks very promising.  It's water-soluble and it tastes like sugar.

Making mung gel candies would require more molecular gastronomy skill than I have.  I'd need to find a way to suspend the vegetable matter more effectively.  Had I the skill to make it correctly, it might still be a bad idea.
