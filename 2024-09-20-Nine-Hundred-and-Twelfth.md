5:18.  I am in a loop of stress and misery.  I feel like food would help, but I have resolved presently to not eat until at least 9:08.

5:19.  I have considered a longer abstinence from food under the special rule that I will be allowed to have one foot-long veggie delight from Subway every day.

5:26.  My eyes are watering.  I am so stressed.

10:46.  I kept to a thirteen hour fast, despite how I felt.  It's not a big fast, but I managed it, and I hardly manage any fast however short any more.

10:50.  46,914.

11:32.  I haven't been very productive.  46,930.

17:00.  48,837.  Wow, productivity has been pretty hard lately.  1,923 words of progress.

17:06.  It's been a while since I've had any alcohol.  Maybe it would help break my writer's block.  I've poured a slightly hazardous level of gin for myself.

20:00.  51,510.  4,596 words of progress.  I am taking a break, and possibly stopping for the night.
