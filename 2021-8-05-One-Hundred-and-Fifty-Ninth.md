It's psoriasis.  The itchy patch on my scalp... and other things as well.  I've got a diagnosis from a dermatologist.  The biopsy bore fruit.  I've no fungal infection after all.

I sure wish I could lead experiments in tolerogenic dendritic cells.  This is curable, modern medicine just doesn't know that yet.  Might cure a lot of people.  Some of them don't know or have never admitted to suffering what this could cure.  Medicine doesn't see the potential... no, it doesn't see the *necessity* of treating neural autoimmune disorders, and psoriasis is one.

Psoriasis.  It's not just a skin condition.  It's a systemic autoimmune disorder with psychological consequences.  I wonder how many dermatologists know that.  I wonder if mine does.  I'll mention it to her.  I'll make the probably-futile effort to talk about tolerogenesis treatments using autologous dendritic cells.  I'll appeal to her vanity and the note of potentially discovering something new; I'll show her research links associating psoriasis with neurological disorder and plead for my own mental health.  I expect to get nowhere.

Cumulative autoreactivity.  Senescence researchers didn't key on it early.  That was a mistake.
