In strategy games, I tend to avoid population growth multipliers.  I've repeatedly come into conflict with people who don't do this, and who don't understand doing this.  This is the pettiest factor in my life, for which I am blaming no great suffering, yet it's one I want to call attention to, because in doing so I have come into conflict with people who do not understand *resisting maximization to protect quality of life*.

I don't care what *strategic value* people represent.  I want to pin that back.  I want people to be individually valued and given a better quality of life, all across society, even if that means facing a more difficult collective struggle.  So I don't use the fertility rites pantheon in Civ VI, and I reject the basic evil of natalist policies in The Viceroy, and similar decisions in other games... and I've noticed that a bunch of people who steadfastly misunderstand me, and even angrily misunderstand me, don't do that.  They say, you know, "growth is so valuable"...  and yet I end up over-optimizing them.

It's a petty wish, but I wish I could get more people to ditch this presumption even in private gaming, because a lot of those people born as a result of excess pressure have suffered greatly in history.  Those who engage with fiction are not obligated to avert fictional sufferings, but part of what makes fiction meaningful is conceptual engagement with fictional sufferings, and people who see only numbers to maximize while they play games just don't get there.

Why aren't there more people who would get disturbed by seeing 20-Wealth "blissful" populations in The Viceroy described as living in an endless sea of "humanity" (aka a sea of flesh)?  That isn't a meaningful and valuable life.  The "influence" such people wield must be contesting hideously against the boundaries of a life where they have no access to resources, no space to live, and no purpose other than to be a sexual object for generating yet more people in the sea of flesh.  How is that "happiness"?  The numbers presented for optimization cannot tell enough of the story.

I wonder if it would be possible to induce weather events through creating a big "ramp" in a windy area, designed to create upthrust air by curving the surface windflow upwards into the air.  For instance, I would expect that an artificial ramp behind an artificial lake in an area with frequent surface winds would result in enhanced precipitation within the shadow behind the lake+ramp, because moist air would be regularly lofted vertically at that point.  Humanity should do more of this kind of experiment than it has...  It's not really as cost-prohibitive as its been presented.  Basic earth-shaping weather control experiments are about as expensive as building the grounds of a mansion, without the expense of building a mansion itself, and with less (though not zero) maintenance expense than the grounds of a mansion.

People rebuke geo-engineering as if fancy landscaping were literally impossible.  We shouldn't have let conservative fear of the consequences of all policies take over so many of the leading heights in society; our society already has signs of stagnant regression!  People don't seem to think it's even possible to do stuff that two generations ago would've been boring normality.

People then didn't realize that their landscaping and architectural decisions could have possibilities that we now realize these things could have... but we in realizing these new possibilities have quailed at the impossibility of stuff that would've been straightforward labors before!

Creating a prototype mirror-drone fleet to alter precipitation flows at sea is about as much effort as it takes to plate a large car dealership with cars, you know?  It's that much metal worked with *less* difficult engineering.  By calling it less difficult engineering, I do not mean to demean the challenge of novel engineering, but merely to point out the true fact that modern cars have been advanced to a specificity of engineering that considerably exceeds what it would take to find out if weather control is possible through creating machines that collectively initiate controlled increases or decreases of thermal absorption at sea.

Yet our current society regards an engineering investment analogous to filling a large car dealership with cars as unfathomably billions of dollars of expensive.  What happened?  "All the productive people died" literally amounts to dishonesty, because we still *are* plating large car dealerships with cars.  That *is* the same productive talent it takes to modify the weather.  Likewise, we still engage in massive earth moving to build factories, and that's what it takes to do landscaping experiments for weather modification.  The necessary technology already exists, people just don't believe in it.  

Some people rebuke arguing that new things should be attempted, without seeing the conservativism in themselves.

I wonder if a glider could be built covered in metal spikes so that it would attract lightning, then dropped from a high-flying plane to glide into a stormcloud.  That might be a spectacle if it worked.  The glider would be ruined, of course, unless it could survive being struck with lightning a great many times.
