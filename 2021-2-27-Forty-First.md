# 2021-2-27-Forty-First

In strategy games, I tend to avoid population growth multipliers.  I've repeatedly come into conflict with people who don't do this, and who don't understand doing this.  This is the pettiest factor in my life, for which I am blaming no great suffering, yet it's one I want to call attention to, because in doing so I have come into conflict with people who do not understand *resisting maximization to protect quality of life*.

I don't care what *strategic value* people represent.  I want to pin that back.  I want people to be individually valued and given a better quality of life, all across society, even if that means facing a more difficult collective struggle.  So I don't use the fertility rites pantheon in Civ VI, and I reject the basic evil of natalist policies in The Viceroy, and similar decisions in other games... and I've noticed that a bunch of people who steadfastly misunderstand me, and even angrily misunderstand me, don't do that.  They say, you know, "growth is so valuable"...  and yet I end up over-optimizing them.

It's a petty wish, but I wish I could get more people to ditch this presumption even in private gaming, because a lot of those people born as a result of excess pressure have suffered greatly in history.  Those who engage with fiction are not obligated to avert fictional sufferings, but part of what makes fiction meaningful is conceptual engagement with fictional sufferings, and people who see only numbers to maximize while they play games just don't get there.

Why aren't there more people who would get disturbed by seeing 20-Wealth "blissful" populations in The Viceroy described as living in an endless sea of "humanity" (aka a sea of flesh)?  That isn't a meaningful and valuable life.  The "influence" such people wield must be contesting hideously against the boundaries of a life where they have no access to resources, no space to live, and no purpose other than to be a sexual object for generating yet more people in the sea of flesh.  How is that "happiness"?  The numbers presented for optimization cannot tell enough of the story.
