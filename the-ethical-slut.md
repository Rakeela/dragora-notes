# The Ethical Slut

The Ethical Slut is a hard book for me to read, and writing about it will necessarily cover awful territory.

It's something I should've read years ago, and yet it's also something that I feel wouldn't have saved me any grief.  This material is adjacent to ideas that were used by people who immersed me in a sexually abusive subculture and abused me as a desperately lying slutty incel when I (with the help of a therapist) departed it.  It's too close to instruction that made me vulnerable for me to believe that it would have helped me escape the warping of that instruction, and yet the whole reason that manipulation worked was due to the backing of excellent ideals.  As for what happened in the aftermath of mistreatment: people who had every reason to know very well to the contrary cast me as an enraged "incel" virgin and encouraged others to pick on me for my supposed lack of sexual experience.  For obvious reasons, I'm not fond of people who use their supposed sexual superiority to abuse others.

Well, my single favorite thing about The Ethical Slut is that it praises integrity as vital to healthy sexual practices.  The authors actually used the word integrity!  If I'd been taking notes throughout reading the book, I would give a page number here.  Likewise for a sentence about consent that amounts to a good slash against people who hurt me.  These thoughts make me want to reread the book and take better notes the second time, but I'm going to focus on reading through once linearly.

Before I knew anything about sex-positivity as an ideal, my initial perspective on sex was derived from being a philosophical hedonist from early childhood (my earliest memory of contemplating hedonism was at age 5), and hearing too much about how pleasurable sex was.  My father was sex-positive, though I don't think he knew the phrase or had connections to sex-positive subcultures, whereas my mother believed "sex is inevitable" and had a creepy libidinous antisexuality more typically associated with conservative men.  (They divorced when I was four.)  Sex was in all the music, everything about culture and social life was supposedly ultimately about sex (even my schoolteachers got creepy about that topic, and when I expressed disagreement I found myself mocked by teachers and students alike), and it seemed like sex was treated as the sole reward in life.  I was annoyed at it.  I had already experience with a lot of pleasure at that point (books, contemplation, nonsexual music, food) and it seemed like all of it was being treated as inferior to sex.  I was also curious.  If the only person I knew who didn't like sex was my mother, and she was hypocritical about it, then it seemed like literally everyone couldn't be wrong.  So I was determined to "fake it 'til you make it" and put on a good positive face towards sexuality.

It didn't work.  Sex is like [[paprika]] to me.  I can't taste it, metaphorically speaking, and it doesn't seem pleasurable to me.  The overriding feature of sex (and sexual response) appears (to me) to be something that I call compulsive positivity.  I was initially incapable of saying that I disliked a sexual interaction.  That's compulsive positivity.  I experienced that even though from the outset there was always dissonance involved.  Deep down, I didn't want it; I'd only sought sexual connections because I was trying to have a positive attitude towards something that everyone said was inevitable, and I didn't understand why I could only speak positively of something that I didn't enjoy.  There arose in my mind the very fervor against artificial control that creates so much strife, and I started watching for this compulsive positivity in the hopes of untangling it.  I was capable of disliking sex, and I wanted to be capable of saying so.  Indeed, I wanted to /reclaim/ my ability to say so; I'd had no difficulty expressing annoyance with sexual culture before I'd had experience with it.  I wanted to be able to complain... and when I could, that was more satisfying than sex itself.  Self-control isn't known for its direct hedonic value, but if it couldn't rank above unpleasurable experiences, people would hardly think to value it.  I became gradually more capable of complaining about and expressing dislike for sex.

I don't think The Ethical Slut would've helped me complain.  I do wonder if I could've accessed a better subset of society if I'd read it.  I wonder who I'd be today if I'd met this kind of people, rather than the people who I actually met.  I really wish I had.  What if I'd met people whose use for sex-positive ideals was about more than finding victims that they could believably "uninvite" from society (something that the book recommends on page 54 as a way to handle sexual abusers)?  I certainly got "uninvited" very hard, though I ended up being grateful; it meant that I was no longer being expected to perform on threat of being treated as authoritarian if I didn't, and therefore being "uninvited" meant I was no longer being sexually harassed by people I didn't want to fuck who weren't properly respecting my consent.  I did get treated as authoritarian as had been threatened, and my civil rights were transgressed against as though in reciprocation of my "obvious" fascism...  Yet I've never threatened anyone else's civil rights, nor advocated for such.  It was better to take the consequence of noncompliance than remain obedient to the abusive social environment I had been snared in.

Beyond working under threats that proved true, I also got blackmailed by one of the involved...  I'm almost grateful even for that, since that specifically was the over-the-top stressor which lead to my eventually seeking the advice of a psychotherapist!  I first tried to better serve the blackmailer, to kind of take it as a compliment ("this guy wants my attention that badly"), but that was a mistake.  I should have noticed it as a behavior that doesn't exactly speak of people who think sex is something good whose free expression society should tolerate more.  Blackmailing leverages society's historic hostility to sexual expression!

I hardly knew about that historic hostility, growing up.  It's weird.  In some ways this world doesn't look like the Earth I grew up on, and I'm too uncomfortable to talk about that right now.

Anyway...  Most of what I've written so far is about why this book is hard for me to read.  I'll talk more about its actual contents below this line, I promise.  I'm on page 182 as of writing this.

There's a lot of relationship advice in the book.  It's about the skills needed to manage engagement with a mode of social engagement that people often resist talking about or helping anyone with.  I feel like if more people read this book, Earth would have fewer suffering lonely people disconnected from society.  It even talks about how to flirt, and how to do so without disrespecting anyone involved; that definitely seems like a topic where bad advice seems often to outweigh good advice.  Something I love about the book is that it's fundamentally polite.  It's all about getting along *without* disrespecting others or hurting their feelings.  There's a lot about emotional management, too.  Contrary to the conservative stereotype of disconnected sexuality (where do they suffer so much of that?), the book portrays a world of good emotional connections.

One sample piece of advice from where I currently am in the book (page 182) is about managing disagreements, and it notes something that I think people often miss: disagreements predate their point of discovery.  All two people disagree on something, and yet people often live and work together for years before discovering disagreements.  If a relationship - be it friendly, romantic, or professional - was previously functional when two people didn't know they disagreed about something, why is the emotional response to discovering disagreement as urgent as it is?  Obviously, this doesn't negate the urgency when the need to resolve disagreements is *practical*, but a lot of the things people disagree with each other about exist in the nebulous conceptual realm rather than the realm of the quotidian.
