06:20.  I'm in the middle of morning stuff, and I can't remember what compelled me to create this time point, but I'm up!

17:01.  I haven't done anything useful today.  If I'd at least attended to my time points, I would've been pushed to do SOMETHING.

17:03.  There are two things I seem to need to do in a day to be productive, creatively.  The first and foremost is to attend to my time points.  The second is to play at least a little Cultist Simulator.  I'm loading that up now.

17:52.  I'm not sure about my idea to play a Winter cult in Cultist Simulator.

17:54.  Winter's theme in Cultist Simulator seems to be perseverance when perseverance is hard.  It's also the theme of ultimate failure.  It's the theme of both endings and not-quite endings.  It's a theme of struggle.  I like it because it's the theme that subverts Edge in Cultist Simulator.  I like it also because I have to struggle against bad conditions myself.  Yet I don't know if Winter influence is good for anything.  Bringing that to the world seems bad?

18:45.  I'm suffering a crisis of confidence in my next story Greeve's Ambition.  I lack the drive to rewrite an entire book to shore up my confidence in this one, and talking with Kistaro, zie's fairly confident that Greeve's Ambition has a good basis already.

18:46.  3,456 words.

20:35.  4,964 words.  1,508 words of progress.  That's quota, despite a late start.
