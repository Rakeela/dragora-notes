8:27.  33,706.

8:31.  I cheated a little bit.  I clocked in, then went to the restroom.  I don't count it as 'a break' when I go to the restroom, so...  It's work time.

8:54.  33,737.  I've been error-checking the cast list while planning Vennaveld's route.

13:20.  36,088.  Taking a break.

13:44.  Back to work.  For the moment.  I may go back on break.

15:15.  37,253.  Taking a break.

16:20.  I ate a veggie delight with sriracha sauce!  It was so terribly spicy that I have to give it a demerit.

16:31.  I got back to work at the 16:20 point, but I've been doing conceptual work that didn't add to my word count.

17:31.  37,841.  I'm finding the work slow.  Aberrantly slow.  I am straight-up hesitating on my writing.  I need to take another break.  There is something wrong with the energy with which I am approaching the material.

21:21.  11.4 miles.  1,926 kcal.  40,706 steps.  8 hours, 13 minutes, and 57 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.

21:46.  40,588.  6,882 words of progress.  I am not multitasking effectively.  I keep advancing this project when I am sitting on my reread of Stone and Paintings.

21:47.  It's hard to estimate exactly how much time I spent at work today, because I forgot to mark a 'back to work' timepoint after stopping work at 17:31.  Still, I think I have worked enough today.

21:50.  Having trouble peeling myself from the work.  I have tears in my eyes and I'm not sure why.  This can mean I'm dissatisfied with the writing, but I do not seem to be.

21:52.  I can think of a potential rewrite that I could put into the writing to make Selena more respectful of normal social boundaries, but it's too late and I've been working for too long as it is.  I like what I wrote, but I think that Selena - the person - would prefer I make Selena - the character - behave more appropriately.

21:53.  I may split the drafts and preserve the current version as a draft.  Alternatively, I could establish a Named Version.

21:54.  I think I will do that.  I have named the current version and tomorrow I can focus on fixing it.  I do not need to split an entire draft because I have written Selena interrogating someone with too much physical contact.
