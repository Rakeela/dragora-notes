#imagine-a-body-implant

This will be a list of all imagine-a-body-implement moments throughout my notes.  I'll record them here and link back to the node where they were first described.

Imagine a body implant that:
1. Raises the temperature of cold muscles to improve cold tolerance and exercise ability.
	1. I've noticed while exercising that I have trouble engaging in physical exertion while cold.  With mild chill, the exercise itself can soon make me grateful for the chill as exercise generates heat within the muscles.  Yet even a slight chill can make it more difficult to get there.
	2. Major swimming feats are often limited by hypothermia.  This has no application to my own use-case, but I think it's really cool when people perform feats of long-distance swimming.  The rescue rate for people lost at sea would incease as well, as people with these implants would last longer in the water.
	3. I have a strong affinity for icy landscapes.  This would make them healthier to visit for myself and others, improving health outcomes in northern climates around the world.  I don't climb mountains, but this would also reduce the fatality rate from mountain climbing.
	4. Nudism would be a bit more popular as it would be practical in a wider range of biomes.
	5. A network of these warmth implants could fix minor cold spots in the body as well, improving personal comfort in a minor way.  This would also improve sleep quality at night.
	6. Creeps with thermal cameras would lose something that would give them an insight into the emotions of people they're observing, reducing vulnerability to the exploitation of information asymmetries.
2. Filters out excess leptin from the bloodstream
	1. If hyperleptinaemia were eliminated, leptin resistance shouldn't occur, and leptin sensitivity would remain functional.  Restoration of leptin sensitivity would naturally quell the appetite of people who are overweight.
	2. If the filter can be manually modulated, it could serve as an "eat signal" by deliberately depressing leptin levels when it is correct to rest and eat, then as an "activity signal" by allowing leptin levels to climb when it is correct to exercise.
