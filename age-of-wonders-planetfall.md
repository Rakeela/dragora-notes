# Age of Wonders Planetfall

I interpret this game to be about societal conjectures in conflict.  The actual tech level of the conflict is not what's portrayed to the player.

This first came to me while contemplating something the lore says about Es-Teq technology: that it mechanizes a lover's touch.  What could the Es-Teq be doing that mechanizes a lover's touch and has an entropic effect on technology?  Well, what is their fixation?  They are the people who become their descendants.  Hm.  What if an advanced society tried to conquer a "defenseless" "primitive" society, but that primitive society had actually developed very happy, stable, and appealing social norms?  That'd be a draining conquest.  The conquerers would win, but they would be shedding compassionate defenders like a rainstorm sheds water before, during, and afterwards.  What kind of victory is that?  The subsequent blending of those two societies is hardly guaranteed to actually destroy a people with very happy, stable, and appealing social norms... the people using them will try to defend them while the people they're being defended against will be trying to adopt them!

When these societies blur together, the primitives who were helpless before military force are hardly guaranteed to be destroyed amidst assimilation.  Their norms will win, their descendants will survive, and their spirits will consume the minds of those who conquered them.  It's just... those norms didn't uphold the technology of their conquerers, did it?  The primitive society is likely to end up the beneficiary of a technological transfer, while the conquering society risks losing modes of thought that it required to defend its advanced development.

That's [[Es-Teq]].  They have their fingers on the unstoppable tide that flows beneath the battlefield, and their entropic weapons are the ghosts of love and beauty which infest their lands.  If your society's machinery is at odds with that beauty, your peoples' spirits will reject themselves in defense of it.

I see all the other races and philosophies as likewise representing something less than literal.  The [[Celestian]] for instance are presented as purity and light, but what do their low-level soldiers use?  Their fists.  What do their high-level soldiers use?  Madness and mind control.  What is their landscape disaster?  The Veil of Tranquility, which makes people "happier", while inflicting a 20% penalty to research and making everyone more vulnerable to celestians.  Five veils of tranquility will paralyze the research output of a colony in exchange for +30 happiness per turn.  It should be noted that the Veil of Tranquility appears to be a miles-high flaming beacon above a large meteor impact crater.  The Celestian Doomsday device is described as controlling the entire planet with psionically-enforced Truth.  There's a little more on the Celestian page itself, but what I'm getting at in describing them here is that they can also be reinterpreted as a societal conjecture about religion.

Is there a coherent societal structure that can prevent people from acting against it, because there are "righteous" men with fists lurking everywhere that opposition to it gets implemented, and because of the existence of charismatic yet incomprehensible people who can rally others unpredictably as needed?  Well... that's kind of one of the angles on religion.  Yet this also goes back to [[Forests-on-the-Water]], because religious devotion to "the meteor of TRUTH" is one of the insults in NationStates.

The [[shakarn]] are my favorite nation from Age of Wonders.  The others are [[amazon]], [[vanguard]], [[syndicate]], [[kir-ko]], [[dvar]], [[assembly]], and [[oathbound]].  There are also various "secret technologies" such as [[Es-Teq]] which invite similar analyses.

The game also contains "secret technologies"; these are [[celestian]] (ALL IS OR CAN BE GOOD), [[psynumbra]] (ALL IS OR CAN BE BAD), [[xenoplague]] (ALL IS OR CAN BE FLESH), [[promethean]] (BURN THIS DRECK), [[synthesis]] (ALL IS OR CAN BE MACHINERY), [[voidtech]] (WE INFLUENCE THE PROBABILITY OF OUR PATTERN), and [[Es-Teq]] (OUR PATTERNS ARE THEMSELVES SAPIENCES).  As is hopefully clear from my presentation, they each have their merits as philosophical arguments.

Finally, the game contains subfactions.  There's a choice of war or peace with every faction, and if you think about what the faction units imply as a society to live in, there's an argument for war in most of these cases.  The game's factions are relatively on the shallow and specific side, so I've appended -AOW to each in order to clarify the namespace that I'm working in.  I think the most stand-out faction in the game is the [[psi-fish-AOW]].  One of the themes of the game is astral metaphor, which I believe my civilizational interpretation works rather nicely with, and only the [[psi-fish-AOW]] will directly tell you the nature of the game... if you can understand them.  The other factions are [[therians-AOW]], [[autonom-AOW]], [[growth-AOW]], [[paragon-AOW]], and [[spacers-AOW]].
