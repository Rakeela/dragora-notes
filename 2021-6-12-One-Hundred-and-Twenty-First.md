#2021-6-12-One-Hundred-and-Twenty-First

The leftovers on my mung beans and celery (from [[2021-6-10-One-Hundred-and-Nineteenth]] were better cold than they had been hot.  That just went from "highly disappointing" to "I think I'll cook this again for myself".

Mung beans don't need to be softened overnight.  Softening mung beans for cooking them just involves boiling them first.  Cooked with inadequate water, the mung beans were only partially softened.  The same could be said of the celery.  I think that texture was okay, and I discovered while eating mung bean sweets (which I very much recommend) that mung beans themselves are tasty.

Mung bean sweets may be a good way to get people to associate a planty flavor with deliciousness.  Try some!
