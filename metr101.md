   - This one should be fun.  It's what I fixate on.  I think the answer is or will be yes!
 - Homework quiz #3 (Due Jan 24)
 - Concepts and Tools #3 (Due Jan 24)
 - First Test (January 24th, 25th, or 26th)
 - Extra credit survey 1 (Due Jan 21)
 - Extra credit survey 2 (Due Jan 31)
 - Reorganize notes
 - Update to-do list

"Course Outcomes"
**Diagram** the vertical structure of the Earth's atmosphere and explain the concepts of density, pressure, and temperature, and how each varies vertically in the atmosphere.
**List** the major constituent gases of the atmosphere, and describe the special roles played by water in the Earth's atmosphere.
**Visually identify** and classify clouds into the four main cloud families and ten main types.
**Summarize** the concepts of energy and heat transfer in the atmosphere, and identify the primary components of the Earth-atmosphere heat balance.
**Apply** the concepts of forces and force balances in diagramming and describing the nature of atmospheric motions.
**Show** how fronts are formed at the boundaries between air masses, and explain how such boundaries contribute to the formation of various types of storms that occur on Earth, including mid-latitude cyclones, tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and tornadoes.
**Evaluate** the effectiveness of various weather forecasting techniques, and explain the main limitations inherent in weather predictions.
**Describe** the most important anthropogenic effects on the Earth's atmosphere, including air pollution and global warming.

Each of these is a task...  The course outcomes aren't tested directly, but I could try completing them (or doing some analogue thereto) in this space.  Just a thought.

Minor praise for the Environmental Science teacher: almost all of the class discussions are posted in advance.  I suspect some of the due dates are messed up though, and I wonder what happened to Discussion #10.  Regardless, I may go so far as to draft my posts here well in advance.

This course gives weekly objective targets.  Those could be good notes to transcribe, themselves.
**Differentiate** between weather and climate
**Explain** the role of gases and pollutants in Earth's atmosphere
**Discuss** the atmospheric greenhouse effect and assess its impact on climate
**Illustrate** how Earth's seasons are affected by the Earth's proximity to the Sun, the Earth's tilt, and the number of daylight hours 

Station Model
Station Models are a method of demonstrating weather observations.  It looks like the wind measured from a point, with a line drawn towards the direction it is coming from and a system of barbs to label its speed.  One short line is 5 knots, one longer line from the tip is 10 knots, a long line and a short line is 15 knots, two long lines is twenty knots, a triangle is fifty knots.  A triangle, a long line, and a short line adds up to 65 knots, suggesting that the station model can be extended arbitrarily in this way.
There's a whole table of current weather symbols as well.  Every station model should have a current weather symbol next to it.  Dots indicate rain, with heavier rainfalls indicated by more dots.  Asterisks represent snow, with heavier snowfalls indicated by more asterisks.  Drizzle is represented by a quotation mark (what is drizzle, meteorologically?), while falling ice pellets (sleet) are represented by a dot in a triangle.  Freezing rain is a dot in a sideways S, while freezing drizzle (?) is an apostraphe in a sideways S.  A rain shower is a dot above an inverted triangle, while a snow shower is an asterisk above an inverted triangle.  Two triangles one atop the other indicate hail.  Two arrows across each other indicate that blowing snow (but not fresh snowfall) is the predominant weather condition, while a dust-torm is an arrow across an S.  Two horizontal lines is fog, while an infinity symbol means haze (what is haze, meteorologically?).  Smoke is a vertical line topped by a wavy line, while a thunderstorm is a vertical line that turns horizontal and then jags downwards with an arrow.  A hurricane is represented by a solid little vortex.
At the center of the station model is a circle.  This represents cloud-cover.  A circle unfilled is a clear sky.  A circle with a line through it is one tenth or less cloudcover.  A quarter-filled circle is 2-3 tenths; a quarter-filled circle with a line through it is four-tenths.  A half-filled circle is five tenths, while a half-filled circle with a line through it is six-tenths.  A three quarters filled circle is 7-8 tenths.  A full circle with a white line through it is nine tenths, while an unmarked full circle is a completely overcast sky.  Finally, an X in the circle indicates that the station model was filled out without the ability to observe the sky.
Finally, a number is shown above the current weather symbol.  That's the temperature.
Station models are used on weather maps.  They may be used in whole or in part.  Cumulative observation is used to infer weather systems.

The "apple peel" of the Earth
The atmosphere is like the peel of an apple.  The apple peel is less than 0.75% of the apple's radius.  The thickness of our atmosphere is 0.8% of the radius of the Earth.
The teacher marked this for note-inclusion.  -_-

The composition of the atmosphere
The atmosphere is a thin, gaseous envelope around the planet.  Slightly less than 99% of its particles are within 30km of the Earth's surface.  There is no definite upper limit, but it becomes thinner and thinner away from the surface.  It is predominantly composed of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture, with small amounts of other gasses.
The early atmosphere was mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, which escaped into space over 50 million years.  After that, the atmosphere was mostly composed of CO2 and H2O.  Water trapped in molten rocks was being released through steam vents across millions of years to create this second atmosphere.  Excess water vapor in the atmosphere formed into clouds and rained down, forming the oceans.  The oceans absorbed massive amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  These processes cleared CO2 and H2O from the atmosphere, leaving behind the prevalence of inert nitrogen, while oxygen was added by lifeforms.
The three most prevalent atmospheric gasses are Nitrogen at 78.08% prevalence, Oxygen at 20.95% prevalence, and Argon, at 0.93% prevalence.  CO2 is 0.035% of the atmosphere, Neon is 0.0018%, Helium is 0.00052%, Methane is 0.00014%, Krypton is 0.00010%, Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and Hydrogen are at 0.00005% prevalence, while Ozone (03) as a fraction of the whole atmosphere is 0.000007%.

Variable gasses
When exact gas levels matter, gasses are measured in "Parts Per Million", or ppm.  For every one million particles of a gaseous mixture, how many of them are of particular gasses?  If 0.0405% of a gaseous mixture is CO2, there are 405 particles of CO2 for every one million particles of that gaseous mixture.  PPM is the percentage expressed to five significant figures.

Keeling Curve
The Keeling Curve shows the amount of CO2 in the atmmosphere as measured in ppm.  It is assessed at Mauna Loa?  I may have misunderstood that bit.  In addition to the smoothed yearly average, there's also a regular sawtooth pattern in the CO2 readings, as winter die-offs and dormancy of flora reduce photosynthetic removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.  (Looking at how sharp the declines are when the graph is declining, I wonder if we could improve CO2 extraction by expanding year-round biomes!)
Beyond its modern measurement history, the Keeling Curve has been extended into the past by boring out ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland.  The ice bubbles in the ice cores can be used for atmospheric sampling of past environments.

Ozone (O3)
Low level:  Hazardous; ground-level ozone is the primary ingredient of smog, and a major contributor to respiratory health issues.
High level:  97% of O3 is upper-atmosphere ozone that blocks UV light.

My first impression now that I'm getting into the lecture files is that, while I love these pieces of information, I'm not sure how much I have to learn from this course.  It's kind of just a low-value credential.  The fraction of this information which I do not know is wholly comprised of information for which I either have no clear need, or which I could easily look up were it relevant.
It's a little hard to focus on the material.  It seems very high school science.  I'm already familiar with most of this stuff.  The station model was new to me, at least.  I kind of wonder about what creates the 'pause' between each layer of the atmosphere.  What is the tropopause, that causes clouds to stop growing when they meet it?  Why does each pause cause a temperature inversion?
The cause of the temperature inversion is given for the stratosphere as being the warming of ozone molecules as they absorb ultraviolet radiation.   In the thermosphere, temperature inversion occurs because solar radiation in the thermosphere is absorbed by individual oxygen particles, which take large amounts of energy from solar rays.  However, the thermosphere's temperature (very hot) should be contrasted to its heat energy (quite low).  This is due to the sparseness of the thermosphere's atmosphere.

Clouds intercept radiation during the day, and re-emit it during the night, resulting in warmer night-time temperatures and cooler day-time temperatures.  I'm noting that because it sounds like what deserts need!  I'm not...  really likely to forget much of this stuff.  I wonder if I can blitz through the homework doing it well in advance.

Energy budgets
The lecture relates the Earth's energy budget to expense tracking, describing the "currency" of meteorology as heat energy.  The concept of reducing meteorological predictions to heat energy transfers is actually rather intriguing.

Earth's albedo
The average albedo of Earth is 30%.  This was posted with a table of other albedos; I'm not sure if I need to record all of them.

Earth's energy absorption
For every 100 units of incoming solar radiation, 30 (on average) are reflected into space, 19 are absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds, and 51 are absorbed at the surface.  There's no yearly gain or loss of total energy, as incoming radiation equals outgoing radiation...  I'm a little annoyed at the graph that was shown at this point in the lecture, as it presents a 30% imbalance of the incoming and outgoing radiation, contradicting the lecture.
Given that atmospheric absorption is credited with 19% absorption and cloud reflections are credited with 20% reflection, how effective is cloudcover really at fending off excess heat?  Not a question of the course, but my own reflection.

Energy absorption by latitude
Low latitudes absorb more solar radiation than they shed.  High latitudes shed more solar radiation than they absorb.
Does this drive hot weather systems from the tropics?  The lecture cites currents as also being a method by which heat is transferred from the tropics.

Note to self: reorganize notes.  Or archive them messy.  This was from the first batch of college notes I ever started taking.

I was surprised to see this on a practice test (and I got it wrong), so I am informed that: The Earth emits LONGER wavelenths than the sun.
