# METR101

To-Do (Keep this at the top of the file.)
 - Take syllabus quiz (due Jan 7)
   - Extra credit.
 - Complete Concepts and Tools #1 (due Jan 7)
   - Subtask: Locate Concepts and Tools #1
   - Concepts and Tools #1 is located in Module 1.
 - Discussion #1 - Initial Impressions of Weather and Climate (first post due Jan 7; second post due Jan 10)
   - I'll enjoy my classes more if I prioritize these.

"Course Outcomes"
**Diagram** the vertical structure of the Earth's atmosphere and explain the concepts of density, pressure, and temperature, and how each varies vertically in the atmosphere.
**List** the major constituent gases of the atmosphere, and describe the special roles played by water in the Earth's atmosphere.
**Visually identify** and classify clouds into the four main cloud families and ten main types.
**Summarize** the concepts of energy and heat transfer in the atmosphere, and identify the primary components of the Earth-atmosphere heat balance.
**Apply** the concepts of forces and force balances in diagramming and describing the nature of atmospheric motions.
**Show** how fronts are formed at the boundaries between air masses, and explain how such boundaries contribute to the formation of various types of storms that occur on Earth, including mid-latitude cyclones, tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and tornadoes.
**Evaluate** the effectiveness of various weather forecasting techniques, and explain the main limitations inherent in weather predictions.
**Describe** the most important anthropogenic effects on the Earth's atmosphere, including air pollution and global warming.

Each of these is a task...  The course outcomes aren't tested directly, but I could try completing them (or doing some analogue thereto) in this space.  Just a thought.

Minor praise for the Environmental Science teacher: almost all of the class discussions are posted in advance.  I suspect some of the due dates are messed up though, and I wonder what happened to Discussion #10.  Regardless, I may go so far as to draft my posts here well in advance.

Discussion #1 - Initial Impressions of Weather and Climate - Due Jan 10
Discussion #2 - Identifying Clouds in your Area - Due Jan 17
Discussion #3 - Can We Make It Rain? - Due Jan 24 - I'm looking forward to this one.
Discussion #4 - Water Draining In Opposite Directions - Due Jan 31
Discussion #5 - Historical ENSO events - Due Feb 7
Discussion #6 - Muddy Topics - Due Feb 14
Discussion #7 - Weather and Economics - Due Feb 21
Discussion #8 - Most Memorable Weather Event - Due Mar 7
Discussion #9 - Weather in Media and History - Due Mar 7
Discussion #10 -  ??? - Due ???
Discussion #11 - Climate Change - Due Mar 14

This course gives weekly objective targets.  Those could be good notes to transcribe, themselves.
**Differentiate** between weather and climate
**Explain** the role of gases and pollutants in Earth's atmosphere
**Discuss** the atmospheric greenhouse effect and assess its impact on climate
**Illustrate** how Earth's seasons are affected by the Earth's proximity to the Sun, the Earth's tilt, and the number of daylight hours 

Station Model
A method of displaying wind stats?  It looks like the wind measured from a point, with a line drawn towards the direction it is coming from and a system of barbs to label its speed.  One short line is 5 knots, one longer line from the tip is 10 knots, a long line and a short line is 15 knots, two long lines is twenty knots, a triangle is fifty knots.  A triangle, a long line, and a short line adds up to 65 knots, suggesting that the station model can be extended arbitrarily in this way.
