I've been surprised by the lack of any distinct etiology for schizophrenia while researching it for my [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]].  It's associated with great swathes of petty sufferings and minor sicknesses.  Research has focused on neurochemistries and genetic histories, yet my intuition is presently that it's quite simply what happens to minds subjected to inexorable suffering.  This dovetails with my thoughts about the medieval period, where I believe that sociopathy and schizophrenia were both highly ubiquitous and disastrously normal.

Most past societies treated parenting as intrinsically virtuous, and beating children obedient as necessary to virtue.  Consequently, most children in most of history were abused.  The first great universal mental health intervention was then improved child welfare, first through increased reproductive success of more peaceful people (who "passively" let their children "spoil"), and then through increasing amounts of central intervention to enforce pacifistic engagement with children.  My own history (reared in violence, albeit school violence rather than familial violence) suggests that there's more to be done in this respect, and yet I think the tremendous advance in wealth and prosperity since this problem was wholly untreated attests to the inherent efficiency of resolving it.  You can't punch people into being willing to tell you the truth.  They'll only learn to hate you in any way they can.  Voluntary integrity is the only stable kind.  Science relies on people being motivated towards the reveal of truth, which even efficacious torments destroy, as torment must proceed in concealment even as it teaches concealment to its victims.

Our society's rejection of the universal virtue of parenting enabled tremendous advances in parenting quality as the moral authority of the parent was disposed of in favor of the needs of the child.  Yet even though my own life story has now become *highly* anomalous (there is not *that* much work to be done, AFAIK), many kinds of suffering persist, and there are still many people with highly chaotic minds.  They suffer hatred, are afflicted by hatred, and afflict others with hatred.  Since the much-hated schizophrenics appear to be the product of inexorable suffering, it seems like if we were willing to treat them better, they would probably perform better.  Yet unfortunately, it is wholly psychologically impossible for humans to defy hatred, which reprograms humans into obsessive dishonesty.  It is therefore futile to propose that people are capable of reducing interpersonal suffering by respecting each other more.  Humans are just too robotic for that remedy.

In the spirit of roboticism therefore, and the acknowledgment of necessity, I now suspect that the next great universal mental health intervention will be the remediation of immunoresponse mistuning.  If we can get rid of the background aches and sicknesses which afflict people who suffer permanent early errors in their immunoresponse programming, we can reduce some of the mental chaos in humanity without need of adjusting interpersonal behaviors *directly*, achieving thereby an indirect yet likely ubiquitous advance aligned with the patterns of human social automatism.
