I've been surprised by the lack of any distinct etiology for schizophrenia while researching it for my [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]].  It's associated with great swathes of petty sufferings and minor sicknesses.  Research has focused on neurochemistries and genetic histories, yet my intuition is presently that it's quite simply what happens to minds subjected to inexorable suffering.  This dovetails with my thoughts about the medieval period, where I believe that sociopathy and schizophrenia were both highly ubiquitous and disastrously normal.

Most past societies treated parenting as intrinsically virtuous, and beating children obedient as necessary to virtue.  Consequently, most children in most of history were abused.  The first great universal mental health intervention was then improved child welfare, first through increased reproductive success of more peaceful people (who "passively" let their children "spoil"), and then through increasing amounts of central intervention to enforce pacifistic engagement with children.  My own history (reared in violence, albeit school violence rather than familial violence) suggests that there's more to be done in this respect, and yet I think the tremendous advance in wealth and prosperity since this problem was wholly untreated attests to the inherent efficiency of resolving it.  You can't punch people into being willing to tell you the truth.  They'll only learn to hate you in any way they can.  Voluntary integrity is the only stable kind.  Science relies on people being motivated towards the reveal of truth, which even efficacious torments destroy, as torment must proceed in concealment even as it teaches concealment to its victims.

Our society's rejection of the universal virtue of parenting enabled tremendous advances in parenting quality as the moral authority of the parent was disposed of in favor of the needs of the child.  Yet even though my own life story has now become *highly* anomalous (there is not *that* much work to be done, AFAIK), many kinds of suffering persist, and there are still many people with highly chaotic minds.  They suffer hatred, are afflicted by hatred, and afflict others with hatred.  Since the much-hated schizophrenics appear to be the product of inexorable suffering, it seems like if we were willing to treat them better, they would probably perform better.  Yet unfortunately, it is wholly psychologically impossible for humans to defy hatred, which reprograms humans into obsessive dishonesty.  It is therefore futile to propose that people are capable of reducing interpersonal suffering by respecting each other more.  Humans are just too robotic for that remedy.

In the spirit of roboticism therefore, and the acknowledgment of necessity, I now suspect that the next great universal mental health intervention will be the remediation of immunoresponse mistuning.  If we can get rid of the background aches and sicknesses which afflict people who suffer permanent early errors in their immunoresponse programming, we can reduce some of the mental chaos in humanity without need of adjusting interpersonal behaviors *directly*, achieving thereby an indirect yet likely ubiquitous advance aligned with the patterns of human social automatism.

I tend to pray for liberation from natalism in society.  I believe that biological immortality is possible and desirable.  I also believe that reproductively active immortals will always tend to exhaust all available resources, suffer miserably, lose control of immortality, and die out.  Furthermore, I believe that people intrinsically cannot consent to exist, because nonexistent entities have no consent state.  Any situation where people have to evaluate their consent retroactively was always at its initial time a consent violation.  New sapiences also lack the ability to evaluate consent even though their consent states already matter.

The only form of reproduction that I believe can exist with no ethical fault of itself is duplicative reproduction, since in that case an existent entity *can* consent to existing in duplicate; the intrinsic consent violation of bringing a nonexistent entity into existence is eliminated entirely due to the fact that both duplicates share a validating consent state.  Nevertheless, the existence of people who would duplicate themselves without considering this a sacred and horrific decision is sufficient to prove to me that no ethical society would tolerate duplicative reproduction either; indeed, for consequentialist reasons I believe that it is probably *more* unethical than other forms of reproduction.  Given the existence of reckless duplicatives in a population, forms of reproduction must be evaluated by *least unethical*, by which measure I believe that cloning with artificial wombs is the *least unethical* form of reproduction.  This is the influence of consequentialist reasoning from the existence of reckless duplicatives.  Cloning with artificial wombs does not eliminate the intrinsic consent violation of creating a new entity, but it does minimize that consent violation as long as individuals are wholly in control of whether and under what circumstances they are cloned.

I don't want to make people immortal because I'm enthusiastic about living in a collapsing horror society where everyone breeds and suffers at accelerated rates until the system crashes out for lack of critical resources.  I want to make people immortal because I already value this world, and I value the potentials that it has if people live long yet do *not* reproduce.  I want to make people immortal because I place a high value on individuals, and I want to see many individuals prospering in happiness.  I oppose natalism because I see meaning in life and wish to expand life's domain, and I do not understand natalism as doing anything but eroding life's meaning while inflicting death on all possible generations.

As we master biomechanics, we will overcome entropy's errors in biological maintenance.  If we overcome those biological errors without also overcoming the reproductive error, resource demands will expand towards infinity, destroying all possible societies.  Would you rather live without resources while raising babies in capsules, one of the trillion ascetic replicants creating more ascetic replicant descendants, or would you rather live forever sharing a mansion and many gardens with your friends?  The second possibility still exists for humanity; the first possibility is the only one that survives replicating immortality.
