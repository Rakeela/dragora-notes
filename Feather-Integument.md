#Feather-Integument

It looks to me like getting feathers to take root in human skin could be done with homogenized integument transplants from suitable avian donors, if the human recipient had first been genetically modified to have skin whose protein constitution is supportive rather than suppressive of feather development.  That gene modification package would also cause all the hair on the body of the human in question to fall out, both head and body hair, so that the bearer of the modifications would have smooth, hairless skin.  Figuring out which genes map to which suppressive effects sounds like a twenty year research project working with microfluidics chips to test different gene modification packages... and I'm concerned that the resulting body would need new implants every time a feather fell out... but the metamorphosis looks theoretically possible to me.

Should I list every possible conflicting gene?  That's my intuition for how to proceed from here.

I've gotten permission to begin recording here as long as I am listing specifically links to research and descriptions of research, but not 'secondary analysis' of research data.  I am somewhat unclear of the meaning of that.

Gilbert SF. (2000). *Developmental Biology: 6th edition*. Sinauer Associates.

This is from a textbook.  I looked this up while searching for information about how the integument initially forms.  My basic knowledge level is pretty low, so I'm still studying the integument itself to find potential intervention points for the generation of hypotheses.  This notably mentions reaction-diffusion process for patterning of integument.

This is about the specific formation of feathers.  It has some pretty stellar diagrams that I wanted to include a link to.  The authors also mention producing a transgenic feather in the abstract.  I haven't read a great deal of it (at the time of first updating the file with this content).

...the interaction of genetics and ontogeny is stupidly complex.  Studying this gives the semblance of impossibility.  It's all secretory chaos with chemicals diffusing across the interstitial spaces of a multicellular organism.  Do the patterns cancel out in different ways at different growth stages?  (This line marked for later deletion.)
