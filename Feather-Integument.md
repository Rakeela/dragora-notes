#Feather-Integument

It looks to me like getting feathers to take root in human skin could be done with homogenized integument transplants from suitable avian donors, if the human recipient had first been genetically modified to have skin whose protein constitution is supportive rather than suppressive of feather development.  That gene modification package would also cause all the hair on the body of the human in question to fall out, both head and body hair, so that the bearer of the modifications would have smooth, hairless skin.  Figuring out which genes map to which suppressive effects sounds like a twenty year research project working with microfluidics chips to test different gene modification packages... and I'm concerned that the resulting body would need new implants every time a feather fell out... but the metamorphosis looks theoretically possible to me.

Should I list every possible conflicting gene?  That's my intuition for how to proceed from here.

I've gotten permission to begin recording here as long as I am listing specifically links to research and descriptions of research, but not 'secondary analysis' of research data.  I am somewhat unclear of the meaning of that.

This is from a textbook.  I looked this up while searching for information about how the integument initially forms.  My basic knowledge level is pretty low, so I'm still studying the integument itself to find potential intervention points for the generation of hypotheses.  This notably mentions reaction-diffusion process for patterning of integument.

This is about the specific formation of feathers.  It has some pretty stellar diagrams that I wanted to include a link to.  The authors also mention producing a transgenic feather in the abstract.  I haven't read a great deal of it (at the time of first updating the file with this content).

...the interaction of genetics and ontogeny is stupidly complex.  Studying this gives the semblance of impossibility.  It's all secretory chaos with chemicals diffusing across the interstitial spaces of a multicellular organism.  Do the patterns cancel out in different ways at different growth stages?  There is no intelligence guiding the growth and making the decisions by which biological structures grow, but yet they grow with intense and well-ordered complexity.  (This line marked for later deletion.)

There's not a lot of genetics information here, but it's a good background in how the feathers develop.  This mentions something I haven't seen before: that the central ("medulla") cells in the feather become "empty" and thereby give feathers "stronger architecture".  What does that mean?  Do the cells become keratinized vacuoles?  Where can I find more information on the process that creates "empty" cells?

(Quoted from source:)
"*In situ* hybridization and immunostaining revealed molecular expression patterns in different cell types. Using the BMP pathway as an example, *BMP4* was mainly expressed in the dermal papilla and the pulp, with expression lower toward the distal end."

BMP is the Bone Morphogenetic Protein, whose name is a little more restrictive than are the applications of the protein itself.  So this source get into the pathways in a salient manner...

Thinking about the objective more closely to focus better, I really want to know what creates the morphology not of the feather nor of how the feather grows, but what creates the morphology of the invaginated zone of the follicle itself.  If the conditions can be made correct for the health of the dermal papilla, certainly then something should grow, ugly as a disordered feather might be.  (Getting a disordered downy feather to grow from a transgenic human skin sample may be an early success, eh?)

(Quoted from source:)
"Using the BMP pathway as an example, *BMP4* was mainly expressed in the dermal papilla and the pulp, with expression lower toward the distal end."

This is as much as I can find here about the biochemical environment in the proximity of the dermal papilla itself.  I was thinking that the follicle-supporting chemistry starts in the base, and I do not (initially) care what happens past the calamus...  If the transplant provides the right genes, I expect (potentially incorrectly) that the structure of the feather will be correct.  Yet even if the transplant tissue has the right genes, it will not provide the right biochemical environment to the follicle without engineering the recipient.  I need to figure out what to search for to find information on the feather follicle specifically.

I have something to present to the next meeting.  I think the current document subsection 'feathers' is misprioritized.  I understand the current goal of the project as eventually developing a human transgenic integument which is capable of supporting the growth of feathers.  To that end, genes governing feather morphology are not as important as genes governing feather follicle morphology, and we need to assemble human genes of interest as well.

I suspect that a human who wants to have feathers will first need genes that cause all their hair to fall out.  This may also be relevant to putting scales on someone.

I would ultimately like to service it as well, but the 'gryphon' case is rather advanced.  Fur and feathers appear to contradict.  They need very different follicles.  It may be easier to engineer a 'dracogryph' than a classic leogryph, as scales and feathers contradict less than fur and feathers.

I found something that showed how the feather morphology could be variously mangled by genetic modifications and I need to find it again.  It helps make the point that we don't *immediately* need to solve what happens past the calamus, because the feather will still grow (albeit incorrectly) if the feather follicle itself is biologically well-supported (as it is in a natural bird that has just had one of its feather morphology genes messed up).  Ugly mutant feathers are not the objective, but they'd be a great 'midpoint' result.

Mostly included for interest.  This doesn't discuss genes, but I found it interesting for what it provided to the visualization of feather structure.  The syncitial barbule fibres of which the rachis is constructed extend unbroken from the base of the feather, being long straight strands until they deviate into the barbs.

I found this while searching for information on GREM1.  It looks like GREM1 activity in the epithelium is essential, meaning it's a hit for both feather morphology and feather follicle biochemistry.

I've continued studying this.  RA is "retinoic acid".  Figure 5, titled "RA signalling modulates vane morphology and epithelial cell shapes." speaks of RCAS-DNRAR-beta infection.  RCAS is a viral vector (replication competent avian sarcoma) that is used for genetics experiments in avians.  In this case, it replaced the beta-variant retinoic acid receptors (RAR) with dominant-negative genes (DNRAR) which were inactive (negative) and prevented the normal function of functional genes for the same receptors (dominant).  Thus the experiment was of knocking out a retinoic acid signal and seeing how it changed the development of remiges (flight feathers) in the chicken.

The feathers still grew, but the test feathers were scruffy, disorganized, and symmetrical, without the broad medial-favoring asymmetry that is necessary for remiges to be flightworthy.

I don't understand the point that this is making about retinoic acid signalling *at all*.  There's a model that they've developed enough to produce simulated I/O in figure 7.  I understand the concept of "steeper RA gradient" to "shallower RA gradient".  That's conceptually simple I/O.  Yet I don't know how to use this.  **How does it differ from human retinoic acid signalling?**  (Emphasis added for future notice.)  What useful hypotheses can I produce from this for wet lab research?  I would like to see the Freedom of Form Foundation doing wetlab work with feathers; the idea of culturing feather follicles from explant epithelial cells is so fascinating to me that it makes me want to grow my own coat of feathers.

I do not understand how the follicle pulp forms the internal gradient distributing the different factors.  In theory those factors *are* what controls the distribution, but I do not understand it.  They're using reaction-diffusion mechanisms...  According to page 7, these researchers have assembled reaction-diffusion equations for extracellular RA, WNT, GDF10, and GREM1, but the mathematical models on pages 11 and 12 are nearly totally opaque to me.  At least I understand algebra...

Figures 4a, 5a, and 2c have standout similarities that I need to understand in order to fully present figure 5a.  I understand that these present mesenchymal (pulp) cells.  I'm trying to find the methodology by which they prepared these samples for observation.  Were they processed according to the methodology described on pages 10 and 11, involving separation of the mesenchyme from epithelium in 2xCMF solution (RNA-seq) or dissociation of the mesenchyme from epithelium via 0.35% collagenase digestion followed by "formaldehyde cross-linking" (ChIP-seq)?
