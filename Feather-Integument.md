#Feather-Integument

I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to put my notes on this in the public.  I'll have to talk to others on the project about how much I can talk about.  Yet I've been frustrated by not knowing where to go, and recording my ideas tends to help.  Since I have no privacy *anyways*, publishing is a way to increase the chance that people who *don't* hate me will also see my notes...  So...  Hopefully I can record some of what I'm doing on this project in the open, free-form, as I work on it.
