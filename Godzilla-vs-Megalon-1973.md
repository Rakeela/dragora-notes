#Godzilla-vs-Megalon-1973

Date First Watched:  2022-05-16
Dates Rewatched:  Never

This one has Jet Jaguar, and more of Godzilla being a hero.  I wanted to watch it to get away from Hesei's villainous Godzilla.  Seeing a reference to Monster Island at the start with a few of the other suits was very reassuring!

This was the first Godzilla movie of "Will Cope", according to the introduction of his first book about Tyrantis.  He's an author whose works I've been enjoying (especially [[No-Sympathies-by-Will-Cope]]), though he makes a LOT of spelling and grammar errors.  Maybe I should upload the error cards I made for each of his books, though first I'd have to figure out where I put down my copy of [[The-Meddling-Youths-by-Will-Cope]].  Mr. Cope praised *this* movie as showing Godzilla to be a lumpy hero, and that's where I got the idea of watching this one to get away from the Hesei continuity's version of Godzilla.

This movie was ridiculous.  Unconvincing fights abounded.  It was okay.  I've decided to classify this one as Silly Showa.  [[Godzilla-vs-Hedorah-1971]] is also Silly Showa.
