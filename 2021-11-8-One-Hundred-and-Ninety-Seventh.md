#2021-11-8-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Seventh

I think my computer got hacked by someone "helpful", and they've "helpfully" changed my Telegram settings.  The new settings are more correct, but no longer changeable.  I uncorrupted the settings nevertheless, and they recorrupted.

The coda was a car honk from outside my window after the settings had recorrupted.

I want my civil rights back.  Even if that's unproductive, even if the criminals are *helpful*, I no longer want criminals to have the right to mangle my computer settings.

Whoever it is that uses 24/7 access to my computer also seems to corrupt games.  I can't play single-player games anymore without anomalies.  I do that to try to recover, but that's impermissible.  I don't think the perpetrator believes in recovery.  They believe in work.  Well, I believe in work, too.  I believe in working through things!

I was actively recovering without this tyrannical abusiveness.  I was getting into research!  I want different neighbors.

The only silver lining is, the only thing I use Telegram for is talking to artists.  So apparently whoever is trying to "help"... thinks talking to artists is a form of work for me.  Could be worse, I guess.
