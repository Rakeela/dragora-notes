Commentary One:
The Univeral Peace Institute gaining strength in an environment of smugglers, pirates, and rebels really captured my imagination.  It stalled my RftG games until I put this together.  The smuggling lair is considered a rare mineral world...  The powerful prospecting guild here appealed to me, too.  It's the capstone of the tableau and it suggests that this empire has an engine of mining productivity backing it.  The fact that all of its miners are scofflaws really makes it fascinating.  There's a combination of danger and idealism in this tableau.  The Rebel Alliance is just as powerful as the Prospecting Guild despite the negative military this tableau achieves.  Are they not using military means to obtain their goals?  They double up with the Universal Peace Institute on gaining value out of military worlds, suggesting this empire is extra-powerful when it acquires the allegiance of militarily dangerous allies, despite the fact that it deploys no conquest.  The only conquest on the tableau was the Smuggling Lair.  The Smuggling Lair is interesting in its own right; its consume power yields two cards for any kind of resource.  This suggests that resources disposed of through the smuggling lair leak off into achievements of which nobody would boast, and in exchange they provide financial rewards and interesting opportunities, ie cards.  The cards in this game represent both money and information, and the Smuggling Lair contributed to this tableau's progression.  Ultimately, in this context, the smugglers must be interpreted idealistically: they contributed to the founding of the Universal Peace Institute, the Galactic Federation, the Rebel Alliance, and the Prospecting Guild.  They should also be interpreted as influential: they yield extra value to three out of the four 6-cost developments on the field, being worth a total of 5 VP on the tableau considering their impact on the 6-costs.
