# MATH130

To-Do (Keep this at the top of the file.)
 - Attend 5:30 PM Zoom class
   - Ongoing
 - HW 1-Chapter 1 Homework (Due Jan 12)
   - Available via online tools.

Course Outcomes:
(No course outcomes supplied; syllabus provides only a busted link.)

I'm concerned that this class shows very poor configuration of its tools.  It's difficult and confusing to navigate the course page.  I'm left worried that I've missed things.

If weekly discussions are intended to be part of the class' structure, none have been uploaded yet.

I'm glad to see a positive difference in this semester vs my prior semesters with this college.  I don't remember seeing fully filled-out class schedules in prior semesters, yet these classes have posted a great deal of work ahead.  I think this may be frictional, and the quality of online education has likely been rising lately.
One factor that's stressful about this semester is that two of my three classes have given me the impression that they'll be on strict deadlines only.  That shouldn't ordinarily be a problem, but my schedule still breaks down occasionally despite medical assistance.  I can only hope my health will let me complete my coursework.  It would have been a foolish gamble a few years ago (when my schedule was 2/3rds wrong), but it's worth trying now (when my schedule is more like 13/100ths wrong).

First class session notes:
The first classroom session coursework appears to be starting with teaching how to navigate the class website, which is good.  I'm having a little trouble understanding the teacher's accent, and I'm still trying to figure out how to parallelize notetaking with paying attention to a real-time class session.  Looking at the first homework assignment (which I'm not currently doing), it looks like there'll be a substantial self-direction factor in resolving these problems in a timely manner.  I'm going to have to study the textbook on my own.

It's hard to avoid yawning and getting distracted by thoughts of brunch tomorrow.  I can eat a few pork rinds without breaking my fast (400 calories per day, keto-biased), so I'll do that.

...Wow, I haven't been following the lecture at all.  I've started studying the textbook.  The lecture is trying to teach something mean mu?  It relates to populations (the grouping of interest) and samples (the subset of the population that we can study directly).  If this information isn't in the book, I hope the lecture video is uploaded afterwards.  This goes on to describe parameters and statistics, where parameters are described as numbers summarizing the population (which are typically unknown), vs statistics which are numbers summarizing a sample (which can be known but may fail to be representative of the population).  Statistics are used to estimate unknown parameters.  

The book at the start of the text is describing categorical and quantitative variables.  It further subdivides quantitative variables into continuous (any value) and discrete (integer-only) variables, whereas it subdivides categorical variables into ordinal (ranked non-qualitative) and nominal (labeling).  This comes with a warning that helps associate it with the lecture: "Be sure to carefully identify the individuals in the study first, so that you can determine what was recorded for each individual."  It gives the example of how the CDC studies the states to produce its reports, and does not study the public directly, so that the 'individuals' populating its study are the states.  (Given how much abstract substitution of concepts is necessary in the understanding of human society, I'm surprised that there can be so many people incapable of algebra in the human population, as I think of the capacity of linguistic substitution whereby 'population' can refer to a population of populations as a faculty similar to that of algebraic ability.)

Ah, now the lecture has spoken of categorical and quantitative data, and it is going forth to talk about graph types.  Bar and pie graphs for categorical data, vs histograms, dot plots, and Stem plot graphs for quantitative data.  Also something about histograms; I missed something here, but it involves TI-86 calculators?  Generating graphs seems like it'll be a basic component of this coursework.

...I spaced a bunch and now there's some kind of assignment available only during the lecture?  Hm.  Skimming the syllabus, it looks like attendance to these class sessions is mandatory, and there's supposed to be assignments filled out on paper during class then emailed to the professor.  I don't see this in the grading system; moreover, it's not going to happen.  Parsing speech is hard, stressful, and persistently uninformative; why can't people just use easier modes of communication like essays?  Oh wait they do, the book is full of communication in a more natural, fluent style than speech.  I'm starting to think I need to make it a hard rule that I will not attend any attendance-mandatory courses.  They're just punishing and uneducational.

Doing some of the stats homework.  First assignment is pretty simple so far, I don't feel like I need the book.  I've made one mistake due to lacking alertness, and one mistake because the book has a mandatory bad read on one of its graphs...  A segment of the graph that's almost level with the segments next to it does not have a value of "twice" "any other group".  Ah, there we go; I've messed something up because I didn't know something the book would tell me.  It only took getting a few questions in.  I'll put this down for now pending further study.
