My everything hurts, and I'm stressed about it.  Beyond anything anyone else has ever done to me, part of what mangles my personality is that I'm in pain all the time.

I've still kept my personal commitment from years ago to never rescind consent retroactively from any of my sexual partners.  Nothing changed about the decisions that *I* made, but I learned more about the conditions under which others pushed me to make them.  *I* still consented to the stuff that I consented to, but I consented to it under the expectation that people were being honest and respectful of my *right* to guard my consent.  They just weren't.
