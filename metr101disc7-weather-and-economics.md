# Metr101disc7 Weather and Economics

This isn't one that I wanted to do 'day of', but it might at least be easy.  The primary difficulty here is just going to be...  morale.  Linking the weather to economics is a pure boosterist exercise by my standards - a real rhetorical party.  The problem is, I'm...  not really feeling up to partying right now.  >.<
