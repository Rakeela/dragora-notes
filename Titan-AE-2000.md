Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Forgotten  (I'll update this if I ever rewatch it again)

I think I first watched this movie when it was newish.  I've rewatched this movie I think twice since.  It's a legend to me.  Unfortunately, it never matched up to the first time I watched it, because...  I had a fever that day, I fell asleep while watching it, and I dreamed of scenes that weren't in the movie.  Stith was a bigger character in the version I dreamed up.  The whole movie was just plain longer and more involved in the version that I saw that first time.  Obviously, there were also scenes in the actual movie that I'd missed.

I like the real version, but I know it's not a great movie.  It'll never compare to the fever dream version.
