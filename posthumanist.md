# Posthumanist

Posthumanism is the belief that humanity should be obsoleted completely.  Posthumans are generally allied with [[transhumanist]]s, who believe that humanity should be upgraded intensely with new technology.  The two exist on a continuum, and the boundary between them is too unclear to sustain conflict.  At what point of upgrading do humans cease to be?  Posthumans are generally satisfied that any intensive process of upgrading will eventually obsolete humans as we know them.

Posthumanism rejects the precept that it is good to be human.
