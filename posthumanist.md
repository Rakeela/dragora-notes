# Posthumanist

Posthumanism is the belief that humanity should be obsoleted completely.  Posthumans are generally allied with [[transhumanist]]s, who believe that humanity should be upgraded intensely with new technology.  The two exist on a continuum, and the boundary between them is too unclear to sustain conflict.  At what point of upgrading do humans cease to be?  Posthumans are generally satisfied that any intensive process of upgrading will eventually obsolete humans as we know them.

Posthumanism rejects the precept that it is good to be human.

I can't deny the likelihood that posthumanism is related to draconity to me.  I want the technology to exist for a panoply of forms to be feasible, because I would like to be a [[dragon]].  I define this concept in a broad and productively-intended manner; I would say the pinnacle of this aspiration would be to interface with the world as an AI whose dragon form was a well-simulated virtual reality component.  More moderately, I long to be valued as a mind in a mechanized world, and I think society is losing potential due to its reluctance to push forward fully on new technological potentials.
