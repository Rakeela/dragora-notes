15:11.  Time is passing, and I'm helpless.  I feel like someone unleashed a secret technological weapon to disable me.  I can't think.  I got up at 7:30 this morning, and I've done nothing productive all day.  I haven't even read or promoted my books.

16:23.  Thinking is so hard today.

16:24.  Something is wrong with me today.

16:37.  I'm kind of upset that there's this creep I'm helpless to do anything about, and I think he's deeply evil.  Corrupt.  Deniably abusive.  I think he picked a fight with me for fun, in front of a group.

16:38.  Not that I've done anything about anyone today.

16:40.  I'm helpless today.  It's awful.  I'm trying to bring my thoughts together so that I can move again.  Just focusing on my misery.

16:59.  Still.  Stuck.  I'm trying to get moving.  The latency period between moments when I notice that I'm having trouble thinking is going down.

17:54.  74,267.  I think I can work now.

20:04.  74,474.  I got a little bit done, and then I pretty much lost focus for an hour.  I wish I'd spent today playing a video game instead of sitting at my computer doing nothing of note.
