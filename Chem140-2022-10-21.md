The periodic table is organized by electron configurations.  The first two columns are the 's' block.  The ten columns of tradition metals are the 'd' block.  The remaining columns to the right are the 'p' block.  The two lines below the table are the 'f' block.  Only helium (electron configuration 1s^2) is 'misplaced', as it has been placed among the noble gasses.

VSEPR:  Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory
Electron groups around the central atom tend to stay as far away from one another as possible to have minimum repulsions.

What is an electron group around central atom?
Can be a single bond, double bond, triple bond, or lone pair.
In SO2 (sulphur dioxide), there are 3 electron groups: a single bond with one oxygen atom, a double bond with another oxygen group, and a lone pair on the sulphur atom.
There are a maximum of 4 electron groups.

The number of electon groups determines the bond angle.  2 electron groups produces a bond angle of 180 degrees and a linear configuration.  3 electron groups produces a bond angle of 120 degrees and a trigonal planar configuration.  4 electron groups produces a bond angle of 109.5 degrees and a tetrahedral configuration.

Electron geometry is the arrangement of electron groups around the central atom.

Molecular shape is the arrangement of atoms around the central atom, lone pair not included.  If there are no lone pairs on the atom, the molecular shape is the same as the electron geometry.
