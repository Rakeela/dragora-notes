7:58.  I am being harried every night, morning, and sometimes in the day by voices telling me I am hateful, unloving, and unloved.  I very much oppose hatred; I very much am dedicated to what I love; I very much am surrounded by people who love me.

8:03.  One of the things I relied upon in the first draft of Taltios' Travelogue is no longer true.  This messes up the sequence.

8:31.  80,898.  Er, I mean, starting tally 80,651.  4,044 words on the chapter.

11:22.  82,335.  1,684 words of progress.  That's quota, and it's a relief to hit it early, but...  I'm worried that my current writing may be repetitive.

11:34.  2,251 words on the chapter.  82,550.

11:36.  82,577.  1,926 words of progress.

15:54.  I stopped at my last time point.  I've been reading since.  I read 34 pages of a dense theology book and some number of chapters of Pridelord.  I feel I need to focus down Pridelord, so I'm going to record my writing productivity for the day.  I should credit 357 words of editing.  I mostly added rather than edited today.

16:35.  Today has felt long.  I thought for a moment that it "dragged", but it hasn't.  I've just felt like I've had lots of time.  When I've checked the clock today, I've found that less time than I thought had passed.  It's really nice.  I like having lots of time.

21:22.  I have run out of the yellow flags I was using to mark points of disagreement in the theology book that I've been reading.  The author's insistence that morality stems on God is revolting.  Even religious people should not think that way.  Morality should stem from ideals.  God's own morality should stem from ideals, as should everyone else's.  In the absence of God, the same processes attain, and the removal of God from the equation does not change one iota what is or is not permissible in society.
