# Envs100disc8 FoodvsClimate

I really just want to phone this in.  I wish I were more personality-wise adapted to doing so.

(Quoted from instructions)

By eating local, organic, vegan or vegetarian you are following a type of diet that can also reduce your impact on the environment. Try one of these ways of eating for 1-3 days - let us know what you ate, if it was hard to follow and how you think the way you eat can reduce your environmental impact.  If you are unable to get to the grocery for this assignment then let us know what you would have tried and why.

Instructions: Your post must have a descriptive title. To be considered for full credit you must type at least 150 words and include two citations. The citations must be in an APA format and  post an original comment by 11:59pm pm on the due date(16 points) .  You should reply to at least 2 posts, one day after the due date. Replies donâ€™t require citations but should be thoughtful and at least two sentences. Replies are worth four points.

I don't believe in this.  It's schlock.  It's a seed of something that could grow into a mighty tree of environmentalism, but it needs laboratories that haven't been built yet and corporations that haven't been founded.  THe real breakthrough here would be cost-effective vat meat.

Vegetarianism is morally superior... slightly...  all else being equal.  It's not.  It never is.  I don't feel like I've learned more of an individual's moral truth when I know if they're vegetarian or not, because the gaps between individuals are much broader than that.  As environmentalism goes, it's about eliminating emissions from meat.  I think the moral argument has more weight.  I think both arguments will be more totally served by vat meat.  I wish that technology was a little more fully implemented already.  I know people are working hard on that.  There are already careers of virtuous people steaked (staked) on it.

Eating local...  it feels primitive to care about.  It feels intensely and stressfully inappropriate.  This one burns me.  I know, I know, farm technology is very much a huge part of technology as such.  I'm very much a fan of biological technologies myself.  (Shapeshifter tech!)  I know that vertifarming directly brings "cutting down food miles" into the advanced world.  I've had *plenty* of fantasies about managing urban vertifarms *myself*.  On Mars.  I'm not willing to do that work on Earth.  ...it's also not what I want to do on Mars, but I'd still consider it awesome.  Despite all this, the feeling of intolerable primitivism persists.  I believe the semi-unified globally economy in food is one of humanity's greatest historic interventions against poverty and severe privation.  My dad taught me that when I was little, but that never exactly seemed like a lie told to a child; there's a lot of good economists who've made that case with good evidence, too.  People complain that sometimes the market gets away with trashing food quality when it shouldn't, and they're *right* about that happening sometimes, but that's never been the overall thrust of market development.

So it's like...  I don't *rationally* think that eating local is primitive, but that's still how it torques my emotions.  I can blame my (human) father, but it's not even something he did wrong this time.  He just was exuberant about global commodities sometimes.  "What does that have to do with the price of hogs?" (or "What does that have to do with pork belly futures?" which meant the same thing) was one of his ambivalently dismissive statements; sometimes it meant that the subject was irrelevant, sometimes it invited discussion of commodity price fluctuations.  Sometimes he left the TV in the living room running, tuned to the weather station; sometimes, he left it running tuned to a finance-oriented channel that showed a lot of commodities markets graphs.  I loved that, but in *this* context it leaves me with a cringing reaction to the idea of trying to go through my food consumption habits to cut down food miles.

Organic...  no.  "Organic foods" as far as I know really are just primitive.  I understand that industrial farming methods are bad and that they pointlessly turn agriculture from something harmonious with the environment into something that destroys it.  I get that, but the answer is not *technique regression*.  The answer is not simplification.  It's better sensors and technologies.  Why don't we build local rail grids across our farmlands so that we can run heavy machinery over the fields to study and remediate soil conditions in an exhaustive and highly detailed way?  The same systems could be used to control all manner of conditions that are currently left up to the weather.  The extra-crazy thing is, this wouldn't add chaos to the system, because that extra control exertion would actually sweep away the errors of industrial farms.

As a kid, I had some interest in agriculture already.  I wanted to see total agricultural automation.  I still kind of *do*.  I once espoused robotic greenhouse projects as a government research endeavor in agricultural technology.  This is just that ideation in a more advanced form.

The errors of "industrial" farms generally confuse and disappoint me.  A bizarre fraction of humanity's farms lack wind control methods, even though wind control is no harder than interspersing fields with tree lines (pretty, but creates nutrient competition at the field edges) or *low stone walls* (which takes less space and does not even create nutrient competition).  One of the technologies that industrial farming is missing is *low stone walls*!  The only reason that organic farming *can* be better for the environment is that organic farmers gather up these "low tech" interventions and implement them.  That's not low tech.  That's agricultural technology.  The judgment of science isn't whether it looks whizbang and shiny, it's whether it *works*.  And...  well, that means I don't think organic farming is actually low-tech, just like I don't actually think eating local is actually low-tech.  Despite that, there's more to it this time than me flinching from my own emotional bias.  I think the perception of organic farming as low-tech is impairing industrial farms from doing straightforward things to improve their yields and sustainability's.  I think organic farming is a category that hurts its industry's ability to integrate technologies holistically.

So I kind of... don't like organic farming.  I see it as a conflict point which is letting humanity down.  The organic farmers can't talk to the industrial farmers about things that would make industrial farmers more productive and more acceptable to the ecological desires of organic farmers, and the industrial farmers likewise can't talk to the organic farmers about things that would make the organic farmers more productive without hurting the environment.  Farmers are out there roasting their beefs forever when they could be cooperating, heh.  The organic farmers are a little less wrong, but they're both wrong in ways where they could both be more right by working together better.

What am I supposed to write about here?  I definitely didn't modify my diet like this.  I've mostly been eating candy this week (and still losing weight, because I've mostly been fasting this week).  There's still plenty of *stuff* to talk about in the above where I worked through my basic thoughts on the subject matter.  Criticizing organic farming appeals to my rhetorician instincts as a form of "optimal disruption" activity, but that's stressful even if it does give me a chance to talk about one of those childhood things that certain individuals expected me to have forgotten.  ...Pfah, that doesn't even make it less stressful.  The sideswipe in my history hits *everything biotech*.  I feel, in hindsight, like the reason I was so depressed is that I was getting spiritually beaten for years by sexually controlling people who were keeping me from my own potential in life.  I *loathe* authoritarianism in sexuality...

I feel like I don't have sad enough songs to make this mood productive, or I don't know my music library enough to optimize it.  Pushing on...

I don't want to talk about vertifarming or vat meat either.  I'm not feeling it.  I feel kind of satisfied by how well this collection of responses categorizes my attitude, but it's not exactly making me happy this time.

Argh!

First draft:
I have to admit that I didn't change my diet this week.  In truth, I consider myself to have eaten mostly candy this week.  I'm reasonably sure that's not literally true, but it's what stands out to me about my diet this week.  I only eat two days in five, but I do that precisely because I'm a glutton.  I want to someday be a skinny glutton.  Changing my diet for this assignment would've changed literally everything I ate all week.  I intend no offense by this, but I don't want to give my college professors the right to ask me to do that.
Climate and food is something that I've thought about many times.  I think about vertifarming and food automation, transgenic engineering for climate resistance and increased yield, vat meat and soil erosion.  When I think of the land where I grew up, I think of the beauty of its ecological management, and how much further the harmony could go between a clean environment and productive agriculture[1].
I don't really think that it's reasonable to press all these behavior modification pressures on the consumer.  Society is a great collaboration!  Shouldn't we be able to trust our food?  People comply best where they comply unforced.  The real front of vegetarianism is the effort to make cost-effective and high-quality meat substitutes[2].  So far, meat substitutes remain pricey and dubious, resulting in their consumption being often an attempt at mindful virtue rather than an ordinary sincere consumerist interaction, and I think that stress upon a mode of virtue is fundamentally a limiting rather than enabling mode.  I think it speaks to the subtle weakening of the great collaboration in society.

Okay!  I think that'll do.

Wait, no.  It ends too abruptly.  Sigh.  I can't ship this.  I'm more of a rhetorician than that.

I don't really think that it's reasonable to press all these behavior modification pressures on the consumer.  Society is a great collaboration!  Shouldn't we be able to trust our food?  I think that this question is at once raised and disdained in modern pressures upon the appetites of others.  I believe that the real front of vegetarianism is the effort to make cost-effective and high-quality meat substitutes[2].  So far, meat substitutes remain pricey and dubious, resulting in their consumption being often an attempt at mindful virtue rather than an ordinary sincere consumerist interaction, and I think that stress upon a mode of virtue is fundamentally a limiting rather than enabling mode.  I think it speaks to the subtle weakening of the great collaboration in society.
The natural harmony is the unforced harmony.  People comply best when they comply with their own desires.  When the right action takes little effort, people will perform it without thought of reward, and they will not need selflessness to achieve that.  So in the matter of improving the public's diet, I am still casting my gaze forward to enabling technologies:  meat vats, vertifarms, and the continued pursuit of excellence in agricultural ecology.  To this I would add chiefly that the advocates of these technologies need to find deeper economies in them, as their less healthy and sustainable competitors are often benefiting from undue cheapness.  I speak as no opponent of sugar consumption when I say that we could use a sugar tax in this country.

There!  That's beautiful.  I even tied the ending to the start.
