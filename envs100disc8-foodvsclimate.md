I really just want to phone this in.  I wish I were more personality-wise adapted to doing so.

By eating local, organic, vegan or vegetarian you are following a type of diet that can also reduce your impact on the environment. Try one of these ways of eating for 1-3 days - let us know what you ate, if it was hard to follow and how you think the way you eat can reduce your environmental impact.  If you are unable to get to the grocery for this assignment then let us know what you would have tried and why.

Instructions: Your post must have a descriptive title. To be considered for full credit you must type at least 150 words and include two citations. The citations must be in an APA format and  post an original comment by 11:59pm pm on the due date(16 points) .  You should reply to at least 2 posts, one day after the due date. Replies donâ€™t require citations but should be thoughtful and at least two sentences. Replies are worth four points.

I don't believe in this.  It's schlock.  It's a seed of something that could grow into a mighty tree of environmentalism, but it needs laboratories that haven't been built yet and corporations that haven't been founded.  THe real breakthrough here would be cost-effective vat meat.

Vegetarianism is morally superior... slightly...  all else being equal.  It's not.  It never is.  I don't feel like I've learned more of an individual's moral truth when I know if they're vegetarian or not, because the gaps between individuals are much broader than that.  As environmentalism goes, it's about eliminating emissions from meat.  I think the moral argument has more weight.  I think both arguments will be more totally served by vat meat.  I wish that technology was a little more fully implemented already.  I know people are working hard on that.  There are already careers of virtuous people steaked (staked) on it.

Eating local...  it feels primitive to care about.  It feels intensely and stressfully inappropriate.  This one burns me.  I know, I know, farm technology is very much a huge part of technology as such.  I'm very much a fan of biological technologies myself.  (Shapeshifter tech!)  I know that vertifarming directly brings "cutting down food miles" into the advanced world.  I've had *plenty* of fantasies about managing urban vertifarms *myself*.  On Mars.  I'm not willing to do that work on Earth.  ...it's also not what I want to do on Mars, but I'd still consider it awesome.  Despite all this, the feeling of intolerable primitivism persists.  I believe the semi-unified globally economy in food is one of humanity's greatest historic interventions against poverty and severe privation.  My dad taught me that when I was little, but that never exactly seemed like a lie told to a child; there's a lot of good economists who've made that case with good evidence, too.  People complain that sometimes the market gets away with trashing food quality when it shouldn't, and they're *right* about that happening sometimes, but that's never been the overall thrust of market development.

So it's like...  I don't *rationally* think that eating local is primitive, but that's still how it torques my emotions.  I can blame my (human) father, but it's not even something he did wrong this time.  He just was exuberant about global commodities sometimes.  "What does that have to do with the price of hogs?" (or "What does that have to do with pork belly futures?" which meant the same thing) was one of his ambivalently dismissive statements; sometimes it meant that the subject was irrelevant, sometimes it invited discussion of commodity price fluctuations.  Sometimes he left the TV in the living room running, tuned to the weather station; sometimes, he left it running tuned to a finance-oriented channel that showed a lot of commodities markets graphs.  I loved that, but in *this* context it leaves me with a cringing reaction to the idea of trying to go through my food consumption habits to cut down food miles.
