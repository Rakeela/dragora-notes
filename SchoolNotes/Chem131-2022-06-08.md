19.4 Protein Structure: Primary and Secondary Levels

The secondary structure of a protein describes the structure that forms when amino acids form hydrogen bonds between the atoms in the bakcbone and atoms on the same or another peptide chain.  (An image is given of a pile of sheets with the caption, "The secondary structure of silk is a beta-pleated sheet.")

A protein is a polypeptide of 50 or more amino acids with biological activity.  The primary structure of a protein is the particular sequence of amino acids held together by peptide bonds.

A thyroid hormone that stimulates the release of thyroxin is a tripeptide with the amino acid sequence Glu-His-Pro, EHP.  Although other amino acid sequences of these three amino acids are possible, only the specific sequence or primary structure of Glu-His-Pro produces hormonal activity.  (The condensed chemical formula for glutamine linked to histidine linked to proline is given.)

Insulin was the first protein to have its primary structure determined.  It has a primary structure of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds.  It has a chain A with 21 amino acids and a chain B with 30 amino acids.

The secondary structures of proteins indicate the three-dimensional spatial arrangements of the polypeptide chains.  An alpha helix (*a*-helix) has a coiled shape held in place by hydrogen bonds between the amide groups and the carbonyl groups of the amino acids along the chain.  Hydrogen bonds between the H of an -NH group and the O oc C=O of the fourth amino acid down the chain.

(A slide is dedicated to a molecular model of an alpha helix with hydrogen bonds highlighted up the helix.)

A beta-pleated sheet (*B*-pleated sheet) is a secondary structure that consists of polypeptide chains arranged side by side.  It has hydrogen bonds between chains and R groups above and below the sheet.  It is typical of fibrous proteins such as silk.

(A slide is dedicated to a molecular model of a beta-pleated sheet with hydrogen bonds highlighted between different peptides in the protein.)

A triple helix consists of three alpha helix chains woven together.  They contain large amounts of glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine that contain -OH groups for hydrogen bonding.  It is found in collagen, connective tissue, skin, tendons, and cartilage.  (The condensed structural formulae for hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are given.)  (An image is given of two faces close to each other, a man and a woman, with a split line starting from their eyes and pointing down to a triple helix image under the image of the two faces.  The triple helix image is captioned, "Triple helix" and "3 *a*-helix peptide chains".)

19.5 Protein Structure: Tertiary and Quaternary

The ribbon model represents the tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain that forms myoglobin, a globular protein.  Learning Goal:  Describe the tertiary and quaternary structures of a protein.  (An image is given of a ribbon model, presumably for myoglobin.  The C-terminus and the N-terminus are highlighted on the ribbon.)

The tertiary structure of a protein gives a specific three-dimensional shape to the polypeptide chain.  They involve interactions and cross-links between different amino acid residues in different parts of the chain.  (An image of a sheep is given above an image of a helix labeled "*a*-helix" and ""*a*-keratin".  The cluster of images is captioned, "The fibrous proteins of *a*-keratin wrap together to form fibrils of hair and wool.")

The stabilizing interactions of tertiary structures are detailed as follows.
1.  Hydrophilic interactions occur between the external aqueous environment and the polar amino acid residues pulling them to the outer surface of the protein.
2. Hydrophobic interactions occur between nonpolar amino acid residues forming a nonpolar center at the interior of the protein.
3. Salt bridges are ionic attractions between the charges of the acidic and basic residues of amino acid residues.
4. Hydrogen bonds form between the H of a polar residue and the O or N of a second polar amino acid residue.
5. Disulfide bonds (-S-S-) are covalent bonds that form when the -SH groups of two cysteine residues are oxidized (H removed).
(A diagram is given for each of these 5 items, depicting an example of such interaction.  The labels indicate a pair of amino acids capable of interacting in that way, save for the first one which depicts aspartate (Asp, D) interacting with water.)

Interactions between amino acid residues fold a polypeptide into a specific three-dimensional shape called its tertiary structure.  (A complicated diagram of a self-interacting protein is given.)

Globular proteins have compact, spherical shapes formed when sections of the polypeptide chain fold over on top of each other.  They carry out the work of cells, such as synthesis, transport, and metabolism.  Myoglobin, a globular protein that stores oxygen (one O2 per molecule) in *skeletal muscle*, contains 153 amino acids in a polypeptide chain, with about three-fourths of the chain in the *a*-helix secondary structure.

Fibrous proteins consist of long, thin, fiber-like shapes, involved in the structure of cells and tissues.  Two types of fibrous proteins include *a*-keratins, which make up hair, wool, skin, and nails, and contain three *a*-helices linked by disulfide -S-S- linkages that coil together the peptide chains like a braid, and *B*-keratins that are found in the feathers of birds and scales of reptiles and contain large amounts of a *B*-pleated sheet structure.

Biologically active proteins with two or more polypeptide chains or subunits have a quaternary structure.  Hemoglobin, a globular protein that transports oxygen in *blood*, consists of four polypeptide chains: two *a*-chains with 141 amino acids and two *B*-chains with 146 amino acids.  (A ribbon model is given of hemoglobin with a tip labeled "Heme group".)

In the quaternary structure of hemoglobin, he subunits are held together by the same stabilizing interactions found in tertiary structures.  Each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embeedded heme group containing an iron center that can bind an oxygen molecule.  (The ribbon model of hemoglobin is repeated with the caption, "hemoglobin carries four oxygen molecules at a time, one in each heme group".)

Table 19.7 Summary of Structural Levels in Proteins.
Structural Level - Characteristics
 * Primary - Peptide bonds join amino acids in a specific sequence in a polypeptide.
 * Secondary - The *a* helix or *B*-pleated sheet, forms by hydrogen bonding between the backbone atoms in the peptide bonds along the chain.
 * Tertiary - A polypeptide folds into a compact, three-dimensional shape stabilized by interactions (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, disulfide) between amino acid residues to form a biologically active protein.
 * Quaternary - Two or more protein subunits combine and are stabilized by interactions (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic) between amino acid residues to form a biologically active protein.

Proteins consist of primary, secondary, tertiary, and often quaternary structural levels.

Chemistry Link to Health: Sickle Cell Anemia: Sickle cell anemia is caused by an abnormality in the shape of one of the subunits of the hemoglobin protein.  The sixth amino acid in the *B*-chain, polar acidic glutamic acid, is replaced by valine, a nonpolar amino acid.  The nonpolar R group on valine is attracted to the nonpolar regions of other hemoglobin molecules.  Hydrophobic interactions cause sickle cell hemoglobin molecules to stick together and form insoluble fibers of sickle cell hemoglobin.

The red blood cells change from a rounded shape to a crescent shape, like that of a sickle.  Sickled red blood cells are rigid.  They clog arteries, cause inflammation, pain, and organ damage, and cause low oxygen levels in the affected tissues.

19.6 Protein Hydrolysis and Denaturation

Denaturation of a protein occurs when the interactions of residues that stabilize tertiary or quaternary structures are disrupted, which destroys the shape and renders the protein biologically inactive.  (An image of an egg is given with two arrows pointing down from it.  The left arrow points to a ribbon of complex shape with the label "active protein".  The right arrow points to a ribbon of simple shape with the label "denatured protein".  An arrow drawn from the left ribbon to the right ribbon has over it the words, "heat, acid, base, heavy metal salts, agitation".)  Learning Goal: Describe the hydrolysis and denaturation of proteins.

Peptide bonds are broken through hydrolysis reactions.  Hydrolysis occurs in the stomach when enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of proteins to give amino acids.  It breaks up the primary structure by breaking the covalent peptide bonds that link the amino acids.  It occurs in cells when amino acids are needed to synthesize new proteins and repair tissues.

In the lab, the hydrolysis of a peptide requires acid or base, water, and heat.  In the body, enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of proteins.(The chemical structure is given for alanylglycylserine (or Ala-Gly-Ser, AGS), and three arrows pointing down from it are marked "hydrolysis".  They point to the three amino acids Alanine, Glycine, and Serine.)

Denaturation of a protein occurs when a change disrupts the interactions between residues that stabilize the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure.  It occurs when the tertiary structure is disrupted and a globular protein unfolds for example.  It does not affect the amino bonds between amino acids.  It makes the protein no longer biologically active.

The loss of secondary and tertiary structures in a protein occurs when conditions change, such as increasing the temperature, making the pH very acidic or basic, adding certain organic compounds or heavy metal ions, or adding mechanical agitation.

Proteins are denatured when heated above 50C.  The heat disrupts the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues.  It does not change the nutritional value of proteins, but makes them more digestible.  High temperatures are also used to disinfect surgical instruments and gowns by denaturing the proteins of any bacteria present.

Proteins can be denatured by changing the pH, which breaks hydrogen bonds between polar R groups while disrupting ionic bonds and salt bridges.  Tannic acid, a weak acid used in burn ointments, is applied to the site of the burn to coagulate proteins.  It forms a protective cover and prevents further loss of fluid from the burn.

Organic compounds such as ethanol and isopropyl alcohol act as disinfectants by exchanging the bacterial protein's hydrogen bonds to water with their own and disrupting the side chain intramolecular hydrogen bonding.  An alcohol swab is used to clean wounds or to prepare the skin for an injection because the alcohol passes through the cell walls and coagulates the proteins inside the bacteria.

Heavy metal ions such as Ag+, PB^2+, and Hg^2+ denature proteins by forming bonds with ionic residues or reacting with disulfide -S-S- bonds.  Dilute 1% solutions of AgNO3 are placed in the eyes of newborn babies to destroy the bacteria that cause gonorrhea.

The whippping of cream and the beating of egg whites are examples of using mechanical agitation to denature proteins.  The whipping action stretches the polypeptide chains until the stabilizing interactions are disrupted.

Table 19.8 Protein Denaturation
Denaturing Agent - Bonds Disrupted - Examples
Heat Above 50C - Hydrogen bonds; hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar resides - Cooking food and autoclaving surgical items
Acids and Bases - Hydrogen bonds between polar residues; salt bridges - lactic acid from bacteria, which denatures milk protein in the preparation of yogurt and cheese
Organic Compounds - Hydrophobic interactions - Ethanol and isopropyl alcohol, which disinfect wounds and prepare the skin for injections
Heavy Metal Ions Ag+, Pb^2+, Hg^2+ - Disulfide bonds in proteins by forming ionic bonds - Mercury and lead poisoning
Agitation - Hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic bonds by stretching polypeptide chains and disrupting stabilizing interactions - Whipped cream, meringue made from egg whites
