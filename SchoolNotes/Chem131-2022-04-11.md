The lab on Friday will be in room 314, not in the lab room.  We do not need goggles this week.  The lab on the 22nd will be in the lab room and will require goggles.

With the structure of HCCH and having a triple bond between the carbons, is the compound ethyne.  Commonly called acetylene, it is used in welding, in which it reacts with oxygen to produce flames with temperatures above 3300 celsius.

Alkenes and alkynes are families of hydrocarbons that contain double and triple bond, respectively.  They are called unsaturated hydrocarbons, because they do not contain the maximum number of hydrogen atoms.  They will react with hydrogen gas to increase the number of hydrogen atoms and become alkanes.  Remember, carbon atoms always form four covalent bonds.

Alkenes contain one or more C-C double bonds.  They have bond angles of 120 degrees and a trigonal planar arrangement.

In ethene (C2H4), two carbon atoms are connected by a double bond.  (Commentary:  There is no methene, so ethene is the simplest alkene.)  Ethene is more commonly known as ethylene.  It's an important plant hormone involved in promoting the ripening of fruits such as bananas.  It accelerates the breakdown of cellulose in plants, which causes flowers to wilt and leaves to fall from trees.  (Commentary:  This application of ethene is straight from the book and not very relevant.)

Alkynes contain one or more C-C triple bonds.  In ethyne (C2H2), commonly called acetylene, two carbon atoms are connected by a triple bond.  Each carbon is also bonded to one hydrogen atom.  Each carbon atom in the triple bond has a linear arrangement with a bond angle of 180 degrees.  (Commentary:  My trig course would call this a *straight angle*.)

Double bonds are indicated on line-angle formulas by a second line alongside one of the lines.  Triple bonds are indicated on such formulas by a second and third line alongside one of the lines.

When naming alkenes and alkynes, name the longest carbon chain that contains the double or triple bond.  Number the carbon chain starting from the end nearer the double or triple bond.  Give the location and name for each substituent in alphabetical order as a prefix to the alkene or alkyne name.

When naming cycloalkenes, assign the double bond to be between carbon 1 and carbon 2 when a substituent is on the ring.  Do not include the numbers for the double-bond.  The carbon atoms int he ring are numbered to give the double bond numbers 1 and 2 and the lowest possible number to any substituents present.

(Commentary:  The naming exercises done on the projector sreen have some value, but they're hard to take notes on.  I can't draw in my .md files.)

(Commentary:  I'm so tired that I'm in pain.  I mean that literally.  I wonder if a painkiller would make life easier right now.  Not that I have any painkillers with me.)

The odors associated with lemons, oranges, roses, and lavendars come from the volatile compounds that are synthesized by the plants that produce these flowers and fruits.  Often these compounds contain double or triple bonds or ring structures; they are unsaturated.  In ancient times, these compounds were highly valued in their pure forms.  Limonene and myrcene give the characteristic odors and flavors to lemons and bay leaves, respectively.  Geraniol and citronellal give roses and lemongrass their distinct aromas.

(Commentary:  There was a break for doing the class activity.)

Cis-trans isomers are the result of C-C double bonds being unable to rotate like C-C single bonds.  The atoms or groups of atoms attached to the carbon atom may (check online resources to complete this paragraph).

In an alkene, the double bond is rigid and does not rotate.  It holds attached groups in fixed positions.  This makes cis-trans isomers (geometric isomers) possible when two different groups are attached to the carbon atoms on each side of the double bond.  These require a prefix of cis or trans to reflect the arrangement of groups across the double-bond.

Cis-trans isomers have different physical and chemical properties.

In a cis isomer, the alkyl groups are attached on the same side of the double bond and H atoms are on the other side.  In a trans isomer, the groups and H atoms are attached on opposite sides of the double bond.

Many insects emit minute quantities of chemicals called pheromones to send others of the same species messages.  Pheromones may warn an insect of danger, mark a trail, attract the opposite sex.  The effectiveness of many of these pheromones depends on the cis or trans configuration of the double bonds in the molecules.

One well-studied pheromone is bombykol, the sex pheromone produced by the female silkworm moth.  It contains one cis double bond and one trans double bond.

The prefix of cis or trans is placed in front of the alkene name when the compound is a cis or trans isomer.  The example given is that of cis-1,2-dibromoethene vs trans-1,2-dibromoethene.

(Commentary:  Notes for section 12.7 start here.)

The commercial process of hydrogenation is used to convert the double bonds in vegetable oils to saturated fats such as those in margarine.

In addition reactions, reactants add to the carbon atoms in double or triple bonds.  A double or triple bond is easily broken, which makes them very reactive.

In alkenes and alkynes, the double and triple bonds are very reactive and undergo: hydrogenation, hydration, halogenation, and hydrohalogenation depending on what is added to them.  They also undergo polymerization at high temperatures and pressures.

(Commentary:  There's a table here including some catalysts.  I can't copy it and I suspect I'll never see it on a test, but just in case...)

Pt, Ni, or Pd are common catalysts for hydrogenation, whereas in hydration reactions the catalysts are strong acids.  Catalysts are not part of the reaction, but they accelerate the reaction somehow (such as by holding the molecules in the correct relative position).  Catalysts used are drawn above the reaction arrow.

Hydrogenation turns alkenes and alkynes into alkanes.  Halogenation turns alkenes and alkynes into haloalkanes.  Hydrohalogenation turns alkenes into haloalkanes.  Hydration turns alkenes and alkynes into alcohols.

In hydrogenation, hydrogen atoms add to the carbon atoms of a double bond or triple bond.  A catalyst such as Pt, Ni, or Pd is used to speed the reaction.  Hydrogenation saturates the alkene or alkyne to produce an alkane.

Vegetable oils are unsaturated fats composed of fatty acids that contain double bonds.  Oleic acid (unsaturated) and stearic acid (saturated) are given as examples (both of these contain a carboxylic acid group).  Adding H2 to double bonds in vegetable oils produces compounds with higher melting points, that are solid at room temperature, such as margarine, soft margarine, and shortening.

(Commentary:  Nearly time for class to end.  My patience for this class is getting better, I think.  I came closer to the end of class before getting frustrated, haha.)

(Commentary:  This teacher refers to hydrogens in a way that sounds like "arogens".)

In halogenations, halogen atoms add to the carbon atoms of a double bond or triple bond.  This again breaks the double or triple bonds.
