A lesson on significant figures.  I don't need to take notes on this...  I wish I'd asked if I could skip this class.

The average is marked by a bar over the number.  The sigma means a sum.  I'm not sure I'm recording this correctly, but maybe recording it will help me get it right should I encounter these in a chemistry assignment.

Tera = 10^12
Giga = 10^9
Mega = 10^6
Kilo = 10^3
Gram, meter, second, liter, and mole
Deci = 10^-1
Centi = 10^-2
Milli = 10^-3
Micro = 10^-6
Nano = 10^-9
Pico = 10^-12

I'm supposed to memorize these.  It's hard to take this seriously, because I think I already know it.  At the same time, I'm aware that I don't have it memorized yet.  I'm worried conversions will drag down my grade.

1 dollar divided by 100 cents equals 1.
100 cents divided by 1 dollar equals 1.
These tools of dividing by 1 are used for unit conversions.
