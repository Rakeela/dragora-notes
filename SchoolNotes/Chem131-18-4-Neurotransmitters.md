18.4 Neurotransmitters

A neurotransmitter is a chemical compound that transmits an impulse from a nerve cell to a target cell.  Target cells may be another nerve cell, a muscle cell, or a gland cell.  (A diagram is given of two nerve cells interacting at a synapse.)

A neuron, also known as a nerve cell, consists of a cell body and numerous filaments called dendrites at one end, an axon that ends at an axon terminal at the opposite end, and junctions called synapses formed between the axon terminals and dendrites of other nerve cells. (Commentary: I'm surprised that nerve cells have only one axon.)   (An image is given of two nerve cells with an axon stretching between them.  The lower nerve cell has an axon stretching off-slide.)

Within a nerve cell, neurotransmitters are synthesized and stored in vesicles at the end of the axon terminal.  When an electrical signal reaches the axon terminal of a nerve cell, neurotransmitters are released into the synapse and taken up by the dendrites in nearby nerve cells, and electrical impulses and chemical transmitters move information through a network in a very short period of time.

Neurotransmitters can be excitatory, stimulating the receptors to send more impulses.  Alternatively, they can be inhibitory, decreasing the activity of the receptors.  The binding of an excitatory neurotransmitter opens ion channels in nearby nerve cells, releasing more neurotransmitters.

Neurotransmitters can be removed from the receptors in different ways: 
	1. The neurotransmitter diffuses away from the synapse.
	2. Enzymes in the receptors break down the neurotransmitter.
	3. Reuptake returns the neurotransmitter to the vesicles, where it is stored.
(A diagram of a synapse is given.)

Neurotransmitters contain nitrogen atoms as amines and alkylammonium ions; they are synthesized from compounds such as amino acids obtained from our diet, and their amino groups are usually ionized, forming ammonium cations and carboxylate anions.  (The condensed structural formulae for serotonin and histamine are given.)

Important amine neurotransmitters include acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine (aka noradrenaline), epinephrine (aka adrenaline), serotonin, histamine, glutamate, and GABA (aka gamma-aminobutyric acid).   (Condensed structural formulae for acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, glutamate, and GABA are given.)

(A table is given describing the functions of different neurotransmitters.  I should probably copy this out later, although I doubt it will be tested.)
