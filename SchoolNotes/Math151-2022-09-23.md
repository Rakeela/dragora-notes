Today's topic is limits!  I hope my battery holds out for the whole 50 minutes of the class session.  Ahem.  Limits.  To quote the book, "the limit of f(x) as x approaches c, is L".  The example given is a graph with an open dot on a curve at a point when the curve would otherwise intersect (2,3).  The value of x=2 is undefined, but the limit of x=2 is 3.

I think I understand limits fairly well, so today is another session I wish I didn't have to attend.  I can't even entertain myself with my phone, and my computer is ticking off its last 16% of battery.
