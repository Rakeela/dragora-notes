I wasn't going to open a notes file for today, but I'm shocked by something the teacher said.  Are we really supposed to memorize the first thirty elements from the periodic table?  My memory isn't very good!

Positively charged ions result when electrons are lost.
Metals tend to lose electrons.
The example is given of a sodium cation which has lost an electron and therefore gained a positive charge.
Cations lose electrons and become positive.
Proton counts do not vary.

Metals: To the left of the Periodic Table
Metalloids:  Along the stairway B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, and Po.
Nonmetals:  Right top of Periodic Table, beyond metalloids and including H.

Non-metals can gain electrons.
The example is given of a sulphur anion which has gained two electrons and therefore gained a negative charge.
Anions gain electrons and become negative.

I tried and failed to do a density conversion.  The failed dimensional analysis is on page 9 of my notebook.  I need to be able to do this for the test.
