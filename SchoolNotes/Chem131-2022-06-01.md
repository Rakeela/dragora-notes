18.3 Heterocyclic Amines

A heterocyclic amine is a cyclic organic compound that consists of a ring of five or six atoms, of which one or two are nitrogen atoms.  The aroma of pepper is due to piperidine, a heterocyclic amine.  (The line-angle formula for piperidine is given alongside a picture of a full peppercorn grinder.)  Learning Goal: Identify heterocyclic amines; distinguish between the types of heterocyclic amines.

Of the five-atom rings, the simplest one is pyrrolidine, which is a ring of four carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, all with single bonds.  Pyrrole is a five-atom ring with one nitrogen atom and two double bonds.  Imidazole is a five-atom ring with two nitrogen atoms.  (Commentary: Imidazole also has two double-bonds.)  

Of the six-atom rings, piperidine is a six-atom heterocyclic ring with a nitrogen atom.  Purine and pyramidine rings are found in DNA and RNA.  In purine, the structures of six-atom pyrimidine and five-atom imidazole are combined.  (The line-angle formulas for piperidine, pyridine, pyrimidine, and purine are given.)  (Commentary: Pyridine and pyrimidine have a double bond structure reminiscent of benzene.)

Alkaloids are physiologically active compounds produced by plants that contain heterocyclic amines.  They are used in anesthetics, antidepressants, and as stimulants, and many are habit-forming.  Nicotine, an alkaloid, is a stimulant that increases the level of adrenaline in the blood, increases the heart rate, and increases blood pressure.  Nicotine is addictive because it activates pleasure centers in the brain.  (The line-angle formula for nicotine is given.)

Caffeine is an alkaloid found in coffee beans, tea, chocolate, and soft drinks.  It is a stimulant of the central nervous symptom.  It increases alertness, but may cause insomnia.  (The line-angle formula for caffeine is given, alongside a picture of two scoops in a pile of coffee beans.)

Morphine and codeine are alkaloids obtained from the oriental poppy plant.  They are used as painkillers and in cough syrups.  (The line-angle formulas for morphine and codeine are given alongside a picture of a poppy plant weeping a white milky substance.)  (Commentary: There's a very unusual nitrogen bond depicted in these formulas.  Are they Haworth structures?)

Heroin, obtained by a chemical modification of morphine, is strongly addictive and is not used medically.  The prescription drug OxyContin (oxycodone) is used to relieve severe pain.  Its structure is similar to that of heroin.  (The line-angle formulas for heroin and oxycontin are given.)  (Commentary: The unusual nitrogen bond reappears here.  Again, are these Haworth structures?)

18.5 Amides

Tylenol, an aspirin substitute, contains acetaminophen.  Acetaminophen is an amide; it acts to reduce fever and pain; however, it has little anti-inflammatory effect. (The line-angle formula for acetaminophen is given.)

Amides are derivatives of carboxylic acids in which a nitrogen group (-NH2) of a primary or secondary amine replaces the hydroxyl (-OH) group of carboxylic acid.  (The example is given of ethanoic acid aka acetic acid being made into ethanamide aka acetamide.)

Amides are produced in a reaction called amidation or condensation.  When a carboxylic acid reacts with ammonia or a primary or secondary amine and heat.  Amide production is accompanied by the production of water.  (The reaction is given that propanoic acid + ammonia in a hot environment -> propanamide + water.  The reaction is given that propanoic acid + methylamine in an environment of heat -> N-methylpropanoamide + water.)

In both the common and IUPAC names, amides are named by dropping the oic acid (IUPAC) or ic acid (common) from the carboxylic acid name and adding the suffix -amide.  Alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen of an amide are named with the prefix N followed by the alkyl name.  (The example is given of butanoic acid converting to an amide and being named butanamide or butyramide.)  (The line-angle formulas are given for benzamide, n-methylethanamide, n,n-dimethylpropanamide, and n-methylbenzamide.)

Guide to Naming Amides
1. Replace -oic acid (IUPAC) or -ic acid (common) in the carboxyl name with -amide
2. Name each substituent on the N atom using the prefix N- and the alkyl name.

Amides do not have the properties of bases seen in amines.  Only methanamide is a liquid at room temperature, while other amides are solids.  Primary amides have the highest melting points and tertiary amides have the lowest melting points.  Primary, secondary, and tertiary amides with 1 to 4 carbons are soluble in water.  (Table 18.3 is given, Melting Points of Selected Amides with the Same Molar Mass of 73g/mole.  Propanamide melts at 80C. 
 N-Methylamide melts at 28C.  N,N-Dimethylmethanamide mellts at -61C.)

Primary amides have the highest melting points becanse the -NH2 group can form the most hydrogen bonds.  They can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making them soluble in water as long as they have less than five carbons.

Secondary amides have lower melting points because they form fewer hydrogen bonds with other amides.  They form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making them soluble in water as long as they have less than five carbons.

Tertiary amides have the lowest melting points because they cannot form hydrogen bonds with other amides.  They can only form one hydrogen bond with H2O, making them soluble in water as long as they have less than five carbons.

Chemistry Link to Health: Amides and Medicine

Urea is the simplest natural amide.  It is the end product of protein metabolism in the body.  It is excreted in urine.  (The line-angle formula for urea is given.)  If the kidneys malfunction, urea is not removed and builds to a toxic level, a condition called uremia.

Aspirin substitutes contain phenacetin and acetaminophen.  They act to reduce fever and pain but have little anti-inflammatory effect.  (The line-angle formulas for phenacetin and acetaminophon are given.)

Many barbiturates are cyclic amides of barbituric acid.  They act as sedatives in small doses or sleep inducers in large doses.  They are habit forming.  (The line angle formulas for secobarbital, meprobamate, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, and diazepam are given.)

18.6 Hydrolysis of Amides

In a reverse reaction of amidation, hydrolysis occurs when water and an acid or a base split an amide. (The example is given of N-methylpentanamide being hydrolyzed by NaOH and heat to form sodium pentanoate and methanamine.). Learning Goal: write balanced chemical equations for the hydrolysis of amides.

Amides undergo acid hydrolysis to form carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.  They undergo base hydrolysis to form a salt of carboxylic acid and an amine or ammonia.

Amides undergo acid hydrolysis with heat to produce a carboxylic acid and an ammonium salt.  (The example is given of ethanamide aka acetamide + H2O + HCl + heat -> Ethanoic acid aka acetic acid + ammonium chloride.)

Amides undergo base hydrolysis with heat to produce a carboxylate salt and an amine or ammonia.  (The example is given of N-methylpropanamide + NaOH + heat -> sodium propanoate + methanamine aka methylamine.)
