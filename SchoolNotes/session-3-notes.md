# Session 3 Notes

I'm still trying to show up to these classes.  They're difficult for me.  I suspect that if I could find the right things to write during the lecture, I could keep my attention on the content throughout.  If that balance works, perhaps it will function as a useful meditation upon the skills currently to be instructed.

Initial indicators are positive.

Following is transcribed (from the lecture slide) the current class announcements.  {} indicates my annotations.

Announcements:
1. Homework 1 is extended to 1/13.  {I've already completed this.}
2. When you open your sapling learning homework (even before you answer your first question) it will say your grade is 0% and as and when you progress it will change.
3. It takes at least 10 minutes for the canvas and sapling learning gradebooks to do deep integration. So, wait for 15 minutes to cross check your final score in canvas.
4. Watch the YouTube video for each chapter (link given in canvas)
5. Watch the recorded video of the class lecture under panopto recording (canvas top left hand side)
6. Go through the exercise and chapter summary.

The teacher is currently explaining these.  I didn't know how long it takes the grades to update.  I'd noticed some discrepancy, but hadn't worried about it as I'd noticed also that the grades were eventually correct.  I get the impression that this teacher's overall presentation speed will not make keeping notes too challenging.

Describing Quantitative Distributions with Numbers

{Transcribed from lecture}
The quantitative can be described using numbers.

...I still can't understand everything the professor says.

It's a lecture about chapter 2 overall.

{Slide transcription}
Describing Distribution with Numbers
1. Measures of center: mean, median, and mode {covered today}
2. Measures of spread: quartiles {today} and standard deviation {thursday}
3. The five-number summary and boxplots {today}
4. IQR and outliers  {thursday}
5. Dealing with outliers {thursday}

{Slide transcription}
Measures of center: the mean
The mean, or arithmetic average
(10+2+3+9+11)/5
= 35/5
= 7 {the mean}
{"Average and mean are one and the same." - I wonder about /that/ as an artistic statement.}

{Skipping a slide of transcription.  I understand the arithmetic average.  I'm not getting value out of the professor's next slide, though as I watch her write on the slide I'm starting to appreciate her presentation of the concept as an application of algebra in process explanation.}

{Excel?  Ah, she's showing potential ways to automate this task.}

{Transcribed from professor's annotation on slide}
The Sigma greek alphabet to represent sum

{There's an E-like symbol not readily transcribed in this form of notes, presented as Sigma, and described as an alternative summation for "the result of adding all the values in a sequence".  If you take Sigma as an input in an equation, its value is equivalent to all the values in a specified sequence added together.}

{An X with a line atop it is described as an alternative summation for "the mean".  If you take X-with-aline-atop-it as an input to an equation, its value is equivalent to Sigma of a specified sequence divided by the number of items in that sequence.)

{Sum is equal to 1/n times Sigma i=1... times x to the item..?  Hm.  I think I understand this concept better without that particular tangle of notations.  I'm not equipped to transcribe them in this format, and I'm not quite familiar enough with them to deconstruct them into a competent linguistic representation.}

{Slide transcription}
The Mode
Most often occurring term
(The one with the maximum frequency)
* Sort observations from smallest to largest

{Transcribed from professor's annotation on slide}
2, 1, 1, 3, 4
Mean = {X-with-a-line-atop-it} = 11/5 = 2.2
Mode: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 {Professor drew a line under the two 1s.  It's curved as though she were drawing a smiley face using the comma between them as a nose.}

{Transcribed from professor's annotation on slide}
Find the mode:
2, 1, 2, 7, 8, 7, 5
Sort: 1, 2, 2, 5, 7, 7, 8
Mode: 2, 7 {Professor described this as 'bimodal'}

{Slide transcription}
The median
Middle term
Sort observations from smallest to largest
Example 1.
Find the median of 3, 2, 7, 5, 1
Sort: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 {Professor circled the three}
Middle term is 3. Median is 3.
Example 2: find the median of 5, 2, 7, 1
Sort: 1, 2, 5, 7
{Median = X-with-a-line-atop-it of 2, 5 = 3.5}

{Slide transcription}
Find the mean, median, and mode for the following:
3, 7, 1, 5, 9, 10, 2, 3, 14, 5, 9.
{Sort: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9, 9, 10, 14}
{Mean = } 
{Median = 5}
{Mode = 3, 5, 9}
Mean = 68/11 = 6.182 {The professor moved forward before I'd finished doing the arithmetic.}
Median = 5 {Okay, so I got this one right}
Mode = 3, 5, 9 {Got this as well.}

{Slide transcription}
Calculation of Median
Column 1: 1, 2, 3, {Etc, to 25.  Each number in column 2 has a label for its position in the column.}
Column 2: 0.6, 1.2, 1.6, 1.9, 1.5, 2.1, 2.3, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 2.9, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.7, 4.9, 5.3, 5.6, 6.1
{The median in Column 2 is highlighted in purple.}
Column 3: {As column 1, but truncated to 24 elements}
Column 4: {As column 2, but truncated to 24 elements}
{This was being used to demonstrate how Column #4's median must be calculated as the average of its two most central items.}

{Slide transcription}
Find the Mean and Median for the following:
1. 1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5
Mean: 4.93
Median: 3
2. 1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,11,12,15
Mean: 4.93
Median: 3
3. 1,2,3,4,5
Mean: 3 
Median: 3
4. 1,2,3,4,5000
Mean: 1002
Median: 3

{The teacher is describing a property of symmetric curves.  I think she just said that in a symmetrical distribution, the mean and median are the same.}

{She's describing something about mean and medians in a skewed curve.  Note to self: The thin side is the way the curve is "skewed to".  So a curve that is thin on the right side is skewed to the right.  The teacher describes this as a property of the mean and median.  The mean is higher than the median in a curve skewed to the right, and lower than the median in a curve skewed to the left.}

{Now she's describing five thousand as an outlier.  Example four, she has described as "a symmetric curve with an outlier".}

{There was some stuff I might've missed while working with merge conflicts on my notes, but it sounds like she's talking about the same stuff repetitively...}

[Slide transcription]
Comparing the mean and the median
The median is a measure of center that is resistant to skew and outliers.  The mean is not.
{graph with identical mean and median} Mean and median for a symmetric distribution
{graph with mean less than median and long tail on left} {graph with mean greater than median and long tail on right} Mean and median for skewed distributions

{Slide with a big pink line at the top and a thin blue line across the middle} {?}
{Teacher draws a red line in the middle of the thin blue line, talking about splitting it into two equal parts, and then labels the red line as the Median.}
{I'm feeling self-conscious about grasping for things to take notes on.  I feel like I understand this subject.}
{A description has been given about how the median divides the set into two equal parts, and then the two equal parts into two further equal parts.  She's working up towards presenting quartiles, isn't she?  Haven't I seen this exercise before... in kindergarden?  This is the most basic explanation of dividing in fourths.}
{Q1, Median, Q3 are the three quartiles...  I suppose this is at least a little difference from dividing in fourths.  It's referring to the medians of the halves, so it produces three quartiles.}

{Slide transcription}
Measure of spread:
quartiles
The first quartile, Q1
The third quartile, Q3
Column 1: {As column 1 before.}
Column 2: {As column 2 before, but now the sixth and seventh variables are highlighted as Q1 = first quartile = 2.2, whereas the 19th and 20th variables are labeled Q3 = third quartile = 4.35}

{The teacher has further annotated the columns, labeling the 1st value as the minimum, and the 25th value as the maximum.}

{Slide transcription}
Example--quartiles
How fast do skin wounds heal?
Here are the skin healing rate data from 18 newts measured in micrometers per hour:
28 12 23 14 40 18 22 33 26 27 29 11 35 30 34 22 23 35
Sorted data:
11 12 14 18 22 22 23 23 26 27 28 29 30 33 34 35 35 40
Median = ???
Quartiles = ???

{Median = 26.5, and I got it ahead this time.}
{Quartiles; 1st = 22, 3rd = 33; Minimum = 11, Maximum = 40}
{Five number summary = 11, 22, 26.5, 33, 40}

{The next exercise appears to be 'calculating the same thing with a calculator'.  This is new to me.  Unfortunately, the calculator I had on hand was the wrong one, and I fell behind on the lesson.  I don't see how to catch up, though I'm not too worried.  It looks like a more fundamental issue than falling behind the instruction is that her graphing calculators have a slightly different interface vs mine, and I'll have to learn to do this somewhere else.  The important thing for me to record here at this point is that TI-83 and TI-84 calculators can output five number summaries based on lists input into them.  This might make some questions easier once I translate the instructions.}

{Something about drawing box plots...  I'm just gonna watch this while fiddling with my calculator.}

{Currently, the whole content of the lesson is being swiftly reviewed as the teacher tabs through the slides at a regular pace.  I've figured out how to tell my graphing calculator to output five number summaries, but I still don't know how to tell it to output box plots, something the teacher intended to teach the automation of during this lesson.}

{Mildest trivia:  When I started using the right program in my calculator to output five number summaries, I smelled ozone in the air.  The calculator creaked in my hands several times, timed with sparks of that scent.}

{Slide transcription}
2.14 Cesium-137 is a waste product of nuclear reactors. A study examined the cesium-137 tissue concentration of a random sample of 15 Pacific bluefin tuna, Thunnus orientalis, captured off the coast of California four months after the Fukushima (Japan) nuclear reactor meltdown of 2011.  Here are the findings, in becquerels per kilogram of dry tissue:
4.8,7,6.2,7.3,6.0,7.3,3.7,9.4,8.4,6.0,5.0,5.1,6.0,7.3,4.7
What is the mean of these data? {6.2, truncated to 2 sig figs.}
2.15 What is the median of the data in exercise 2.14? {6}
{Q1 5, Q3 = 7.3}
{I got it all on my calculator.  The box plot though, would be a hand-drawn effort...  I'm not presently doing that.}

{Judging by the pace of the course so far, it doesn't look like the homework is going to be too hard.  Nice change from the math classes of my childhood, that... though having access to supplemental potassium would've been a real life-saver then, had I knew I could benefit from it.}

{One more update, added well after the class lesson.  I managed to get box plot drawing working on my graphing calculator. <3}
