I have to record this somewhere.  The theorem requested by question 5 of the Math 151 Practice Quiz was "the Intermediate Value Theorem".  It was a question about a continuous function's behavior within given bounds.  The lower bound was below the requested value, and the upper bound was above the requested value, establishing thereby that the requested value was in the range queried.

The history of the intermediate value theorem is that it was for over twenty three centuries considered intuitively obvious and requiring no proof, leading to it first being proposed in the fifth century BC and not actually proven until the nineteenth century AD.

I don't think I'm going to get a perfect score on tomorrow's quiz.  I've drilled on conjugates and even now I worry I won't remember how to work them.

Factoring continues to intimidate me as well.  If I could bring in a notecard, my odds would be greatly improved, because I could bring in the details of the factoring-by-grouping method.  My calculator can factor, but it doesn't do it right.  The factoring such that my calculator performs it the way that I need it to be performed is the factoring that I can do myself most easily.

Oh, and I FORGOT MY CALCULATOR today, as well as my notebook.  I'm so unprepared for class that I feel like leaving early.  At least the teacher is performing derivatives on the board.  I can follow this now.  Of course, it's the same problems that were on the practice quiz' answer key, so I've already studied their solutions.

One thing I don't understand from the lessons given thus far is that I don't understand when I can bring in the value of the limit to help solve the problem.  I also don't understand when I can zero the 'h' to help solve the problem.  Is it that I can zero the 'h' when I won't be dividing by zero as a result?  In that case, bringing in conjugates helps immensely, because it puts a value in the denominator other than 'h'.
