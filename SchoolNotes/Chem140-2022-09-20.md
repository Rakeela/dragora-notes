Substitute teacher today "Jennie Mayer".  Our regular teacher is sick.  The substitute is the department head?  She said that Professor Sandhu (do I have that right?) called in sick on *Sunday*, but we saw her in class yesterday, so I guess she came to work sick.

First notations on the board:
 * Lab safety -> Canvas Quiz
 * Accuracy vs Precision
 * Dependent, Independent, Controlled Variables
 * Rubber Band Blast

Always wear goggles.  Professor Mayer had an anecdote about getting concentrated sulphuric acid in her eye despite wearing goggles, and the damage would've been worse without them.

I already took the lab safety quiz.

"The purpose of today's lab is to talk more about the scientific method," awr, this is going to be a boring day about stuff that doesn't help me perform better on tests.  I may let myself get a bit distracted on my computer.

I already know about accuracy vs precision.  Precision means that multiple measurements are close to each other.  Accurate means that measurements are close to the true value of what they're measuring.

Dependent variables are affected by other things.  Independent variables are things the experimenter manipulates.  Constant variables are things that are not varied.
