18.2 Properties of Amines

Amines contain polar N-H bonds, which allow primary and secondary amines to form hydrogen bonds with each other, while all amines can form hydrogen bonds with water.  (Images are given demonstrating "most hydrogen bonds" between primary amines, hydrogen bonds between secondary amines, and nohydrogen bonds between tertiary amines.)  Learning Goal: Describe the boiling points and solubility of amines; write equations for the dissociation and neutralization of amines.

Amines contain polar N-H bonds, which allow primary and secondary amines to form hydrogen bonds with each other.  Tertiary amines cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other.  Nitrogen is not as electronegative as oxygen, so hydrogen bonds in amines are weaker than hydrogen bonds in alcohols.  (The images from the first slide are given again in the second.)  (Commentary: The repetition is in the slides...)

Amines have boiling points that are higher than those of alkanes but lower than those of alcohols.  Primary amines can form more hydrogen bonds and have higher boiling points than secondary amines of the same mass.  Tertiary amines cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other and have lower boiling points than primary or secondary amines of the same mass.  (Examples are given of propylamine, which boils at 48C, ethylmethylamine, which boils at 37C, and trimethylamine, which boils at 3C.)

All amines can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, but primary amines having two N-H bonds form the most and tertiary amines having no N-H bonds form the least.

Amines with 1 to 5 carbon atoms, including tertiary amines, are soluble in water.  This is because the N atom in smaller amines forms hydrogen bonds with the polar O-H bond in water.  In amines with six or more carbon atoms, the effect of hydrogen bonding is diminished and the nonpolar hydrocarbon chains of the amine decrease their solubility in water.

Ammonia (NH3), primary, and secondary amines act as a Bronsted-Lowry base.  Nitrogen's lone electronp air accepts H+ from water to produce an ammonium ion (NH4+) and a hydroxide ion (OH-).  (The reaction is given for NH3 reversibly reacting with H2O to produce NH4+ and OH-.)  (The reaction is given for CH3-NH2, aka methylamine, reversibly reacting with H2O to produce CH3-NH3+, aka methylammonium ion, and OH-.)  (The reaction is given of CH3-NH-CH3 reversibly reacting with H2O to produce CH3-NH2-CH3+, aka dimethylammonium ion, and OH-.)

An amine salt forms when amines react as Bronsted-Lowry base and are neutralized by an acid.  The "fishy" odor from amines is removed by converting them to their ammonium salts using citric acid.  An ammonium salt is named by using its alkylammonium ion name followed by the name of the negative ion.  (The reaction is given that dimethylamine + H-Cl reacts to produce dimethylammonium chloride.)

In a neutralization reaction, an amine acts as a base and reacts with an acid to form an ammonium salt.  The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom accepts H+ from an acid to give an ammonium salt; no water is formed.  (The reaction is given that methylamine + H-Cl reacts to produce methylammonium chloride.)

In a quaternary ammonium salt, a nitrogen atom is bonded to four carbon groups, which classifies it as a quaternary amine.  The nitrogen atom has a positive charge and is not bonded to an H atom.  Choline, a component of glycerophospholipids, is a quaternary ammonium ion.  (The examples are given of tetramethylammonium chloride and choline, each of which has its condensed structural formula displayed.)

Ammonium salts are ionic compounds with strong attractions between the positively charged ammonium ion and an anion, usually chloride.  They are solids at room temperature, odorless, and soluble in water and body fluids.  Amines are therefore usually converted to their ammonium salt before being used as drugs.

Ammonium salts are used as the active ingredients in medications, including ephedrine, used as a bronchodilator in the decongestant Sudafed, diphenylhydramine, found in Benadryl, used for relief of itching and pain from skin irritations and rashes.

Cocainse is extracted from coca leaves using HCl to give a white soli ammonium salt.  The salt of cocaine (cocaine hydrochloride) is smuggled and used illegally on the street.  (an image of cocaine leaves is given alongside a line-angle formula for cocaine hydrochloride.)

Cocaine hydrochloride, an ammonium salt, can be converted back to its free amine or free base form, "crack cocaine," by treating it with a strong base.  This free amine is rapidly absorbed whens moked and gives stronger highs than the cocaine hydrochloride, which makes crack cocaine more addictive.
