# Envs100disc9 AirPollution

This should be fun!  I'm going to write to promote public moss-based air filtration systems, or something analogously futuristically plant-tech.  Few things strike me as such a joyous shout for biotechnology than plant-based high-tech infrastructure.  I'd rather see mossboxes than trees along a substantial minority of urban roadsides, but especially in industrial areas.

Plus, I get to say nice things about modernizer politicians in China.  I don't know of any specific individuals, but if I remember correctly what I've seen in the media (and assuming it wasn't misleading propaganda), China has the world's largest concentration of both artificial plants and plant-based atmospheric infrastructures.  Their pollution problem is not totally for lack of effort at controlling it.  They'd have to be richer to do a lot more, and therein lies one of the paradoxes of development; getting through the filthy stage of industrialism is a bootstrapping challenge that the world hasn't actually figured out how to meet.  Hm, I'm getting distracted...  No, that's potentially brilliant.  If China is the current leading manufacturer of mossboxes, increased global utilization would direct wealth towards developing that capacity specifically, and would help China grow one of its domestic long-term countermeasures to pollution problems.

Alternatively: these are cool, too.  I know I'm too easily sideswiped by cool factor, but I refuse to believe that a society which industrialized to plate the world in cities can't industrialize to plate the cities in artificial trees.  I mean, if I really embrace the manic causality jump potential here, could you cool the city passively with that?

I'm not likely to use that potential in THIS essay, but I want to give it a paragraph in my notes as part of my creative process.  I would like to know, what happens if you pack a city with a small forest of these on *every* rooftop and build them at the sides of *every* building?  If this pop-sci source isn't overstating the carbon-absorbing potential of them, an urban territory could develop like a hundred times the carbon-sucking power of a forest of its size.  The air would in the vicinity of the city would be a little more oxygenated; would that be perceptible?  The air would be persistently less carbon-rich, and I wonder if that would affect local microclimes.  That's what I mean when I wonder if installing a bunch of artificial trees could cool cities.

This is plant-tech, too.  It uses microflora for maximum optimization.

I wonder if buildings could use the inclusion of an artificial tree atrium in their HVAC systems as a means to lower indoor carbon dioxide accumulations.  If it'd be like passing the air through the carbon-absorption equivalent of 368 living trees, it may be worth giving over two room worths of real estate on the vertical to build one *inside* of large buildings.  Redesigning the microalgae air exchanges to maximize surface area along the wind path in the HVAC system might even allow a superior space-to-power rate, so as to achieve that much absorption power or more with that much space or less.  Hm.  Come to think of it, the forced-air conditions which exist inside of an HVAC system might be optimal for carbon-mitigation, as they are both a point of carbon concentration and a processing accelerant offering predictable flow conditions.  That is a good engineering surface.

If only I could lead the engineering teams!

I wonder if the teacher would rebuke me for using her 'research this subject' prompt to promote an exotic engineering project... but wait, I did that already!  Okay, I think I know my topic now.  Hahaha!

First draft?
I love biological technology.  To me, this is like a species thing; I must love biological technology, and I do.  Being prompted here to research the issue of air pollution leads me at once towards biological technologies.  My thoughts turned first vertical moss installations of moss culture that clean the air in an optimized way.  Looking this up, I found the topic of artificial trees, and I knew at once I had the subject for my discussion post.

Artificial trees use microalgae to process the air that flows past them.  The first source I found claimed to be describing an artificial tree with the carbon-absorbing power of 368 living trees.  When I read about this, I imagined cities reimagined with artificial forests upon their rooftops, gardens of steel and algae cleaning and refreshing the air like tiny hyperforests, until the city landscape began sinking more carbon than the wilderness around it.  We have already built our labyrinths of crystal and steel so thickly on the Earth; can we not add one more layer of steel live with algae?

I thought as well of HVAC systems, where air is circulated within buildings.  Who has not heard of indoor air pollution?  I read in business science research about the productivity impacts of poorly ventilated offices; it is known that carbon dioxide accumulates in indoor spaces and can impair productivity if it rises too high.  If we have a technology that absorbs carbon dioxide with special fervor and capability, why not begin to build it into our society where it will make life more pleasant and productive by building it into our structures as well?  Doing that will help society to absorb carbon at the points where it is being generated.  Furthermore, it should work even better with the living tree technology, because the HVAC system provides a controlled environment with forced air circulation, and the surface area of the algae-air exchanges can be thus arranged to intercept a predictable wind.  That should make them even more effective at absorbing indoor carbon dioxide than they are for absorbing outdoor carbon dioxide, although they would need electricity to supply light for photosynthesis.

In coming up with fantasies and proposals as I do, I can't help but notice that there's something *stuck* about the engineering abilities of modern societies.  We built so much, but now we keep building the same things over and over again.  The amount of metal-working involved in engineering a garden of artificial plants atop the roof of a building is not large compared to the amount of metal-working involved in engineering the rest of the building.  If we have such problems with atmospheric regulation, and we certainly do, why do we not build countless great novelties in answer to it?  Have we reached such a limit of aesthetics that we can we find no room for greater beauty in changing the look of our cities?  A steel civilization could yet be greener than ours!

Hum hum, soaring rhetoric, I suppose that really is my thing.

Let's see...  Business science research about indoor air pollution would help, here.  I *have* read it, I'm almost certain, but let's see if I can locate it outside of the Akashic Records just to be sure.

Hm...  I wonder if HVAC-specialized artificial trees could be built into a kind of "district HVAC" system supplying collective air-cleaning services to residential areas whose buildings are not individually large enough to justify tiny hyperforest attachments on their roofs or in their HVAC systems.  It would work on Earth if it would work on any world, although I'm not sure what community if any might try to construct such a thing on Earth; yet it could be a critical public service for any off-world colonization venture.

I think this could suffice.  I'm just throwing the first source I found at it, but it establishes awareness of the problem.  I can throw another carbon dioxide specific link at the citation block as well just to reinforce the point and make it look less like I used a lazy strategy to find more cross-links in the archive.

I'm actually faintly disquieted by the effectiveness of picking through these archives for what superficially supports my position.  I really am trusting a lot in the honesty of people who have delved farther into their specialties than I have.  I believe in these links as curated collections of truth from which I can draw swift inferences.  I understand that with a rather great investment of my time, I could evaluate the claims in specific studies; yet to do anything in reasonable time that *utilizes* those studies, they must be honest.  My current endeavor is utilizing the current integrity state of the archive, but I am not presently contributing to that state.

I'm probably not going to use this, unless I use it to indicate productivity impairment.  It's another one talking about global atmospheric CO2 concentration.  What I have alleged in my draft is specifically, "carbon dioxide accumulates in indoor spaces and can impair productivity if it rises too high."  I am trying to evidence that proposition.  Can I prove concentration?

"Current ventilation guidelines, such as those from the American Society of Heating Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), recommend that indoor CO2 levels not exceed the local outdoor concentration by more than about 650 ppm."

In other words, it's normal for indoor CO2 concentrations to exceed outdoor CO2 concentrations.  This proves what I needed to prove.

I'm not at all bothered by avowing that as the first source I found.  It's just a discussion board post, after all.  I did it without stressing out about it this time.

Coming back to this one the next day, I really like it.  It's quite a visualization.  Re-reading it makes me want to reorganize my essays so that I have a section of the archive that presents only the current final versions.
