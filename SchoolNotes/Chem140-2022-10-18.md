The 2p orbitals fill with one orbital each before any of them take on a second electron.

---
The energy level of the electrons increases with ascending sublevels.  The 1s sublevel is lower energy than the 2s sublevel, which is lower energy than the 2p sublevel.

There are 6 electrons in the 2p sublevel.

The order of the sublevels in increasing energy up to 3d are **1s, 2, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d**.  This means the 4s sublevel fills before the 3d sublevel.

Continuing, the order up to 7p is **1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p**.  If these are drawn in rows, there are slanted parallel lines connecting them.  The outermost valence shell always ends up with a maximum capacity of 8 electrons.

The fluorine electron configuration is 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^5.  It contains nine electrons at base state.

The chlorine electron configuration is 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^6, 3s^2, 3p^5.  It has 17 electrons at base state.

The bromine electron configuration is 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^6, 3s^2, 3p^6, 4s^2, 3d^10, 4p^5.  It has 35 electrons at base state.

The iodine electron configuration is 1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^6, 3s^2, 3p^6, 4s^2, 3d^10, 4p^6, 5s^2, 4d^10, 5p^5.  It has 53 electrons at base state.

All four of these have seven valence electrons in their highest or outermost shell.  Relatedly, they are in group 17 on the periodic table, which is also group 7A.  The group+A number on the periodic table predicts valence electrons.

Due to the striping of the electron sublevels, the outermost shell of valence electrons has up to 8 electrons, even as the shells fill.  The valence electrons are the electrons that participate in chemical reactions.  These electrons can be lost, more electrons can be gained in the outer shell, or they can be shared.

---
Covalent bond:  Formed by sharing of valence electron between nonmetals and metalloids.  The example is given of two hydrogen molecules bonding with their single electrons to form a single covalent bond.

When drawing Lewis dot structures, the central atom is written first, the central atom is closer to metals, hydrogen is never in the center of any molecule, and the central atom makes the maximum number of bonds.

Step 1:  Count total VE
Step 2:  Decide which atom is central
Step 3:  Make single bond (place 2e) between central atom and surrounding atom to complete skeleton of molecule or ion
Step 4:  Assign VE in pairs to surrounding atoms until the octet is complete
Step 5:  If octets of surrounding atoms are complete, all VE not accounted for should be placed in pairs on the central atom.
Step 6:  If central atom octets not complete, move VE in pairs from surrounding atoms to make multiple bonds.
