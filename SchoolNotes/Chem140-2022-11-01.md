Balancing chemical equations

Chemical reaction: Composition changes.  The chemical identity of reactants changes.
 * bonds are broken
 * New bonds are formed
 * Rearrangement of the atoms occurs

Evidence
 * Gas evolved
 * Heat produced or absorbed
 * Light emitted
 * Color change
 * Solid appears

Reactants -> Products
Substance you begin with -> Substance you end with
1) Write the correct chemical formula
2) Write the state of matter: solid(s), liquid(l), gas(g), aqueous solution(aq)

Write the catalyst, if any, over the arrow.  Catalysts speed up the rate of chemical reactions without getting consumed.
