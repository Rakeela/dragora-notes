5:44.  Creating a first timepoint.  I woke up at 5:30 on the dot this morning!

6:23.  I laid on the couch for a while.

6:28.  83,649.

6:42.  83,637.  I got distracted.

6:55.  Ugh.  I'm dissatisfied with something I wrote.  Too many italics.  Paragraphs of the thoughts of the POV character.

7:04.  83,631.

7:05.  83,639.

7:11.  83,614.  Credit 3 words writing.  Take my word for it.

7:22.  83,606.  Credit 3,367 words of editing.

7:39.  Credit 14 words writing.

7:48.  Credit 2,236 words of editing.  83,593.

8:39.  I spent a while laying on the couch again.  I haven't drank much caffeine this morning.  Maybe I ought to fix that.

9:12.  I laid in bed for a while.  Getting up early only helped so much.

9:13.  It's hard to convince myself to use my walking desk this morning.  I've only walked for 48 minutes.  

12:04.  I have started another Cultist Simulator game.  It occurs to me that I would have, in the game's terms, at most two passion cards, and possibly only one.  It is frustrating.  I certainly study things purely to fuel my passion.  What are 'glimmerings'?  How do I study in a way that permanently improves my passion?  In my writing, 83,573.

12:19.  83,938.

13:28.  84,007.  I am making no headway.  Uninspired...

17:13.  I should've taken a time point before heading out to buy myself a meal at the Trader Joe's, because now I don't know exactly when I stopped.  My complaint about being 'uninspired' didn't stop me from continuing to work.  84,832.  That's...  1,259 words of progress.  1,276 after 17 words of credits.

19:03.  85,840.  2,284 words of progress.  I'm done for today.  I think I've finished another draft.

20:44.  I haven't been walking for a while, I've just decided to record my daily walk amount.  9.8 miles.  1,757 kcal.  35,555 steps.  7 hours, 56 minutes, 57 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.  The kcal estimate is totally bogus.  I would have an easier time maintaining my weight if walking at that speed for that duration burned that many calories.
