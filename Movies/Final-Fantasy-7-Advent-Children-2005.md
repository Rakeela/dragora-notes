#Final-Fantasy-7-Advent-Children-2005

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I don't remember it well, but I didn't really enjoy this one.  It didn't stick with me, I guess.  I never completed Final Fantasy 7 either, I wasn't enjoying it.  I played it too much for a game I wasn't enjoying.
