#Alice-in-Wonderland-1951

Date First Watched:  2023-08-26
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I'm reasonably sure I've seen this before.

How ridiculous!  Maybe I never saw this before at all.

The Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum segment is pretty annoying.

This is only reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland, surely all these things didn't happen in the book!

This singing flowers scene definitely didn't happen in the book!

Honestly, I've gotten tired of the nonsense.
