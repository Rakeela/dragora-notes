#Con-Air-1997

Date Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Forgotten

I think I've watched this movie twice, but I've forgotten both times.  I want to say I enjoyed it, which is a strange thing to say, because it'd be at best vaguely familiar if I ever saw it again.  Hey, old pleasures can come back, because if you stay away long enough you can forget what they were.
