Introduced to me as "Sea Beast is basically How To Train Your Dragon, but Kaiju".

I liked this movie - the monster was adorable! - but I couldn't believe in the ending that they'd actually side with the monster against the royals.  The movie has the right ending, but I don't believe in the ending, so I'm disappointed.
