I actually played a game for a while during the first portion of this movie.  Playing Beyond Earth with a grotesquely healthy transhuman society.  I'm nowhere close to an optimal player of that game, and I'm pretty sure I can already beat it on any difficulty level.  But this space is for talking about this movie...

I didn't like this Godzilla design.  It was very ugly.  The early model with the huge eyes was particularly unappealing.  I didn't really follow the transitions between appearances, because of my distraction with another activity.

The research scenes confused me.  How did they find more data by origami?  Where did they get that data from, again?

Courtesy of distraction, I watched this movie like an idiot who was too stupid to follow the plot and watching only for the special effects.  Despite that, I was intrigued by some of the political characters, and I'm sure I would get more out of the movie on a rewatch.  I can say that this movie didn't annoy me at any point, which means it should be rewatchable.
