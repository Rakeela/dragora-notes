#The-Land-Before-Time-1988

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I've watched this.  I was a little kid at the time.  I think I watched one other movie from the series, but I'm not sure.  I don't remember enough of the movies to figure out which other one I watched.  The one I'm sure I watched is the original.
