Godzilla-vs-King-Ghidorah-1991

Hesei Godzilla is too evil!  Ignoring for a moment that this movie's concept of time travel is far too free of butterfly effects to be interesting, they use a Godzilla origin concept that had Godzilla as an implausibly durable dinosaur that saved a group of Japanese soldiers by getting into a fight with American soldiers.  This Godzilla is an all-destroying animal who is scripted with a tender moment that gives it pause, but which it then violates.  I don't like it.

When they retgoned the Godzilla that destroyed cities and created Godzilla anew, they wasted a chance to 'purify' Godzilla that way, but treated the new one as equal or worse in aggression.
