This one I avoided for a while due to reports of spiders in the storyline.

I read ahead into the story, and from what I read, I feel like this one sits in the liminal space between Silly Showa and Serious Showa.  Hopefully it has a good plot.

I really like the weather control technology concept.  The idea of a world fearing overpopulation and working to control weather so that food supplies will continue growing is amazing to me.  That would tend to reduce my antinatalism.

Having watched it, I still think this is on the line between Silly Showa and Serious Showa.

This movie was an unexpected favorite.  I thought I would cringe at the "Godzilla's Son" character, but he was actually a really cute part throughout.

I loved seeing more of Godzilla as the heroic character, too.  I like giant not-evil reptiles!
