#Appleseed-2004

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  2022-12-17

I think I've seen this one before.  I've forgotten it pretty thoroughly.  Forgetting all the movies I've seen is such a tragedy, I'm glad I have this list now to record what I've seen and when.  My recording of anime movies that I've watched is particularly spotty.

It's not instantly familiar.  Like with GitS, I may have to revise my claim to have watched it before...

Eh.  It still seems like something I've seen before.  I do feel like I would remember it more than this.  Maybe I didn't see it before?

I dislike it.  I think this movie is bad.  It's still faintly familiar though, and now I think I disliked it before, too.  I think I disliked it less than I dislike it this time, but maybe I never saw it before.
