Dates Rewatched:  Never

I never thought I'd watch this, but...  Sure.  Why not.

Twelve minutes in and I regret it already.  This seems kind of dumb.  I guess it shows off that live action isn't good for the basic magic of Pokemon.  Maybe it has more magic for people with a purer love for the IP than I have.

This is dumb.  I'm glad I missed this a few years ago.  I can't handle this.

It's frustrating.  I can't appreciate this movie.

The ridiculously giant Torterra were a bad inclusion.

Watching people struggle in movies is such a pain.  So.  That wasn't fun.  Very distracting.  Not very fun.  Oh well.  At least now I've seen it.

I want a world without suffering.  Imagining all these worlds of extra bonus suffering is awful sometimes.

This movie really pointed out how messed up Greninja's design is.  Conversely, watching pikachu, mewtwo, and a bunch of the background pokemon (charizards, charmanders) was really a pleasure.  Lickitung was not a highlight.  The problem with gross pokemon is that if you imagine them as though they were really real, they get grosser!
