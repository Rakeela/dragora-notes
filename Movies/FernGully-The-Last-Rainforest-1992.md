I scheduled a rewatch for this!  ...huh.  I'd forgotten it had songs other than Hexxus's song.

"Truth doesn't always win friends, but it certainly influences people." - Batty

It would be easier to stop deforestation if it was driven by rich logging companies all the time, but it's often driven by poor subsistence farmers instead.  I wonder when environmentalists will learn how to combat that, and what techniques will be employed.
