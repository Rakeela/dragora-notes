One of my favorite movies ever!  How did I forget this one?  I've had *dreams* about this movie.  Mrs. Brisby is a name I didn't have to look up.  I know I've watched this movie more than once.

I think the use of magic in the story is kind of a weakness, as the sci-fi dream of experimenting on rats to produce long-lived and intelligent rats who can use technology is much more appealing.
