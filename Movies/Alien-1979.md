#Alien-1979

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

If this isn't the best in the series, I'm never gonna find out.  Something about this series had a mega-anti-vibe to me.  I don't like the setting and I don't like the monster.  I've seen part of another movie in the series and I didn't like it.  The first movie was okay, though.  I liked it.

I'm pretty sure I've seen more than one other movie in this franchise, but I'm absolutely sure I've never seen anything in this franchise that was better than "okay".  Hello Alien, I'm regretting the existence of your entire IP today.  You suck.
