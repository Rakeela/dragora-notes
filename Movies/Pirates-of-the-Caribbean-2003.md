#Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-2003

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

Well, I enjoyed it when I watched it.  Johnny Depp was good in this one.  I don't remember it much anymore.  I keep wanting to call it overrated, but thinking about how few movies have made a lasting favorable impact on me, I'm tempted to say movies are overrated in general.
