I got a bit of a late start on this one, but it looks like most of the movie is still going.

This is a movie where a schoolteacher is given absolute power, and he immediately loses all sense of what is a good idea to use power on, in a manner that is very much Movie. It completely butchers his character very quickly.

It's clearly supposed to be teaching a lesson about how to use power properly, but it was unbearable. Few people would act like that. Most people who would act like that, would not _get better_ from acting like that. They threw him too deep into the evil pit for him to be believably redeemed, and they did it too quickly for the descent into evil to be believed itself.

I did not finish watching the movie.
