I'm kinda tuning this one out.  I like it, but it's not as fascinating as other things I could do with my time, so I'm multitasking and largely just listening to it.

Akity wanted to watch this one again, subbed rather than dubbed.  I'm paying more attention this time, but...  It's...  I'm not a big fan, and I'm afraid to reveal that.  This is supposed to be a masterpiece, and I guess it's pretty good, but...  I dunno.  I just feel sad and distracted.  I'm actually paying attention this time.
