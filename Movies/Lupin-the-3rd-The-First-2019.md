Date First Watched:  2023-12-08
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I'm not enthused by this, to be honest.  But Akity wants to watch it, and I want to get back into watching things with Akity.  I can watch and write, as long as shows are good enough, but not too good.  This is probably going to be a good writing movie, I think.

It worked.  It was pretty distracting, without being totally distracting.
