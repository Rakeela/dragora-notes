Pokemon is a pretty disturbing show.  The whole fighting thing and the power relationship betweeen trainers and pokemon.

Brock is a pretty disturbing character, too.  He breeds pokemon, but he'd obviously rather breed humans, so to speak.  I'm still shocked that a property for kids starred a lecherous "pokemon breeder" from the outset.

Wow.  Ash has a line suggesting he's really stupid.  And he directs Pikachu to shock a ground type pokemon during the opening credits roll!  I wonder if the people in Pokemon's setting are generally a bit dumb.

This movie seems a bit dumb.  It introduces Darkrai really bluntly.

The prince has a giant model train set?  Remarkable.

Wow.  Ash is written as a dumb brat.

Pokemon transformation, as a Lickitung evolution?

The baron's performance is kinda questionable.  When scripts call for overacting, it's hard for movies to get it right.

Use of "enhance the image" to add detail to an image...

Most of these lines are great, but some of the characters are bad.  "Alicia's" lines are faulty, too.  Not the quality of the writing, the quality of the voice-acting.  It's uneven.

It must have been hard to pick a tune for the performance.  They still had to supplement it with other instrumentals and an implausible light show.  The tower itself is too limited as a musical instrument.  Strings make a more impressively grand performance.

Huh, they didn't do a "world-healing wave" this time.  I'm glad to see a trope averted.
