The intro is weirdly familiar.

Oh man, everything was familiar.  Familiar, familiar, familiar.  Finally it twigged.  I remembered something ahead of what the movie had shown, confirming that it was something I'd seen before.  Ego.  He's a jackass.

This movie is kind of on the nose.  Calling the guy Ego.  Using pod people.

I don't know if they knew what they were doing with Drax.
