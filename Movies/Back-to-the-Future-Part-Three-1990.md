I think I've seen this twice, but I'm not sure.

2024-04-13
Watching it for a second or third time now.

I can't handle this.  Gross humor, lame humor, and...  I don't know.  I thought this was my favorite in the series, and maybe it is, but maybe I just don't love this series at all.  I don't remember the story well enough to have my headphones off and still keep up with it, but I couldn't bear to listen to it anymore.

So many movies are so terrible.
