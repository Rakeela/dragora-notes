I think I've seen at least part of this movie before, but so far I don't recognize the specific segments.  I have one specific scene in mind that I think I can recall, and the rest of the movie so far is all fresh.  Still, I do think I've seen it before.

Oh come on, he shouldn't break that staff.

I wasn't able to multitask this movie with writing.  I barely got any writing done.
