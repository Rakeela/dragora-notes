#Resident-Evil-2002

Date First Watched:  2022-11-25
Dates Rewatched:  Never

Today in the category of things I never thought I'd watch...

Rife with sound leveling issues.  There was stuff that was too loud and stuff that was too quiet.  Couldn't find a volume level I could listen to the whole movie at.

Kind of an "everyone loses" story, isn't it?  The only character who had a reasonable chance to contain the outbreak was the Red Queen.  They lost when they shut down the Red Queen.
