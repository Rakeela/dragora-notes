This one stands out in memory for the brutal fight between Mechagodzilla and Anguirrus.  I love Anguirrus!  There was a fascinating mention of "Godzilla wouldn't attack his friend Anguirrus" that I absolutely adored.

The aliens were a bit ridiculous.  I do my best to take these movies seriously, and I think if I ever rewatch this movie I'll update this file talking about how they're properly cunning and menacing.
