I didn't follow the intro.  I was distracted.  This video that I'm watching is low-res, too.  :/

Wow!  Is this a canonical example of a trainer with a legendary pokemon?!

No, it wasn't.  Heh.  I was too distracted by the movie and by writing to take notes on the movie.  I really loved the movie though, I definitely want to rewatch this one!
