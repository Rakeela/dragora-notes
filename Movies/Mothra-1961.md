See, I'm already forgetting these movies.  This open notes archive has been a boon towards not forgetting stuff, and I want to remember the movies that I enjoyed longer than I *do* remember them.

That said, I kind of hate that Mothra was from "Infant Island".  Why'd they name a place that way?

The two small characters were fascinating to see.  There were some special effects failures involving what looked like small dolls, but even seeing the attempt fascinated me.  I love these Godzilla movies for showing off something of a history in special effects as they struggled to come up with ways to showcase very massive characters, and in this movie very tiny characters as well.
