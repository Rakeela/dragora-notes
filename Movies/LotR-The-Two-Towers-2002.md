#LotR-The-Two-Towers-2002

Date First Watched:  2023-01-14
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I don't think I've ever watched this one before.  It's hard to believe it's all the way from back in 2002.  I still remember the advertising.  It seems like this series hasn't lost its shine, too.  There's still stuff coming out in it.  I kinda wish there weren't.  It's not shiny.

I'm dissatisfied with the movie and distracted with things I'm reading.  I don't feel like this movie deserves its fame.

Some of the scenes are familiar.  Did I forget about watching it before, or did I pick up a lot by cultural osmosis?  Many of the scenes are unfamiliar, too.

I hate kissing scenes in movies..
