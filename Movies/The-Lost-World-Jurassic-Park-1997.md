Dates Rewatched:  

I'm almost sure I did watch this one, but it's like I've never seen it.  I don't remember it at all anymore.  I may give it a new "date first watched" and leave this note in the file, if I ever rewatch it.

I'm rewatching it!

Tch, no.  I didn't watch this one.  I've now watched half of it.  The plan is to watch the other half tomorrow.

The scene with the T-Rexes attacking the trailer bothered me.  They didn't behave correctly.  I really don't think they would've pushed the trailer off the cliff *at all*, and it messed up the movie pretty badly for me.

I'm disappointed.  Too many things had to go wrong for Jurassic Park San Diego to not succeed, and I think it just would've worked.
