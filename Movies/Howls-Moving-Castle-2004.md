I think I liked the book better, but I don't remember either very well at this point.  Maybe I should watch this one again.

I finally got to rewatch it.  What a great movie!  I really had forgotten it.  Not entirely.  Just enough to be surprised again.  Am I grateful to lose memory?  It was special the second time, too.

I didn't so much watch the movie this time.  I didn't really watch it at all.  I just listened to it.  It's such an aurally glorious movie.  I think this movie has the best sound of any movie I've ever watched.
