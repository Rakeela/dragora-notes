#Tron-1982

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

This movie is very famous, but I remember so little of it that I'm not sure I saw it all.  I don't remember the context in which I watched it.  I think it came on while I was watching TV, something I actually used to do.  I think I gained even less from watching TV than I've gained from watching movies.

Thinking about this more, I think what happened is I was very sleepily watching TV, so I didn't so much watch this movie as it one day happened that I fell asleep while Tron was playing on the TV.
