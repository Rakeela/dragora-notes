I was reminded that I've actually seen this by an opportunity to rewatch it.

Huh.  Nothing except waching Po bumble through the training room was familiar.  Did I wach this?  Or was it familiar to me through cultural osmosis?  The idea of Po being motivated to train via food was familiar to me in concept, but the specific scenes were unexpected.
