#The-Lion-King-1994

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Forgotten

I think I've watched this one twice.  It's deservedly a legend and very memorable.  Rafiki is properly mystifying, Scar is enigmatic and terrifying, the hyenas are just competent enough to make sense, and Zazu...  I really liked the character of Zazu, but now I'm finding I can't recall much of Zazu.  Maybe I should rewatch it, but...  nah, probably never again.

I'm aware there was a remake, maybe someday I'll watch that.
