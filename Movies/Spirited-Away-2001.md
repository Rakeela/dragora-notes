I've seen this one twice!  I love it.  I want to watch it a third time.

There!  An opportunity to watch it again.  I've missed some of it, but there's still more to see.

It's weird how much of this movie I'd forgotten.  I remembered No Face's gluttony at the bath house!  But that was one of the few things I remembered.  I got so much more out of the movie this time than before.  I had forgotten Haku turning back into a human once given his true name.  That was disappointing!  He looked better as a dragon.

Now I want to watch this a fourth time someday.
