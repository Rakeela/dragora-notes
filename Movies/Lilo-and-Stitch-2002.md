Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Forgotten

I've watched this one several times.  It's another one of my favorites.  I look forward to rewatching it again someday and having something to put down in the "Dates Rewatched" section.  I love redemption stories, cute aliens, and that song about the Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride.
