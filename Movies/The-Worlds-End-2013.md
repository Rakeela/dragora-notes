I got a bad feeling about this one, watching the intro.  I think I'll dislike it.

Hm.  Okay, that ended pretty well.  It had its ups and downs, but it was better than I expected overall.  Love to see a climax that ends on a speech check, too.  Games shouldn't have a monopoly on talking the enemy to death.
