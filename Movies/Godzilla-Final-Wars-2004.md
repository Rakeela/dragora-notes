The opening was overdramatic.  I've just started watching this, I wonder if there'll be more of that.

Aww, I don't want to watch a sea dragon lose a battle.  This movie already has a dragon casualty count.  I don't know if I can forgive that.

Most of humanity got stomped in this movie.  Wow.  No wonder the canon rested.
