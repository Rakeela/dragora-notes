I don't think this looks like a good movie, having just started it and gotten a view of the animation.

The characters are oddly bigoted.  They react negatively to ugliness.  That's gotten unusual.

Space depicted as full of debris.  Boo.

This movie's humor is relentlessly dumb.

This movie's humor is still relentlessly dumb.
