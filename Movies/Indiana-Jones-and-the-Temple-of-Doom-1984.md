I'm not sure if I've seen this one before.

This looks pretty unfamiliar, I think I'm watching it for the first time ever today.

This movie isn't a favorite.

I had seen before the scene with the Ark killing the Nazis, but everything else in the movie was unfamiliar, so I don't think I'd ever watched the movie properly before.

Why are my notes confused about which movie is which?  This isn't the movie with the Ark killing the Nazis, but now I've definitely seen it before.
