#Despicable-Me-2010

Date First Watched:  2023-01-07
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I wasn't expecting to watch this today and I don't think I'll pay very much attention.  Hm.  Although "Bank of Evil: Formerly Lehman Brothers" was a nice touch.

It's a stock comedy redemption story...  With dumb evil that becomes less dumb good.  I don't like it at all.

DNF.  I don't want to watch this all the way through.
