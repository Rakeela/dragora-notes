#Mothra-vs-Godzilla-1964

Date First Watched:  2022-04-08
Dates Rewatched:  Never

It's tempting to just record the fight, but I liked these movies for the basic drama of the characters.  I think this is the one where Akity said that the movies were also a commentary on the overwork culture of Japan.  I don't have much to say though, truly what stuck with me was Godzilla losing a fight to two Mothra larva that coccooned him.

I liked the movie.  The Mothra movies all have interesting singing.
