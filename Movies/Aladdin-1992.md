This was Robin Williams to me for some years.  I think the whole movie might be forgettable without his ace performance of the character of the genie.

I'd forgotten that Iago repeated after Jafar.  I'd forgotten that they cited Allah in this movie, too.  I'd forgotten most of this movie!  Even Jafar's hypnotism.  Also, Iago has teeth.

Huh.  Jafar has no need of the lamp, he's already the most powerful person in the kingdom, with vast magical abilities.  What is he wanting wishes for?

Hey, the genie turns into a dragon for a shot.  That's awesome.

Wait, what?  Jafar wants to marry Jasmine?  Surprise.

Oh god, this is kinda painful, imagining the effort to impress Jasmine.  Why can't Aladdin just tell her the truth?  This whirlwind romance seems unhealthy.

There's no way they courted long enough to be a safe relationship.
