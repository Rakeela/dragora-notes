I'm pretty sure I've seen this movie before.  I'm a little skeptical.  I'm aware that the phrase 'El Dorado' pretty much just means 'The Gold', and that the Spanish conquistadors were cruel, greedy, and imbecilic, so I'm not sure I should watch this again.

Oh, I can't stand con artist characters!  It's no fun at all watch this.  I'm stopping early.  I got as far as the two con artists being invited into the temple.
