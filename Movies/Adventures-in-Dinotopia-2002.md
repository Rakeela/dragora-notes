I begged Akity until he agreed to stream this one.

I'm kind of immediately finding things to be disappointed by.  This seems to be all about the humans so far.

So, I like it, but I was definitely watching for Zippo across swathes of it.  It also had annoyingly abrupt cuts throughout swathes of it.  It was definitely cut down hard to create this abridged version.
