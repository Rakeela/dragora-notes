The special effects on this one were awesome.  I liked the "Titans as guardians of nature" thing, and Monarch's efforts at containment in quasi-natural environments.

Wow!  It's been over two years since I last watched this.  I think this is my favorite Godzilla movie, and it's basically because I love how Godzilla moves in this show.  I think the story has distinct weaknesses otherwise, though Monarch is still basically cool.

This movie also contains my favorite interpretation of Rodan.
