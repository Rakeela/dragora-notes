#Pocahantas-II-Journey-to-a-New-World-1998

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I don't remember this one, though I think I liked it at the time when I watched it.  If I ever watch it again, I'll probably enjoy it again.  Maybe there would be a downside of remembering everything, though I think I'd take it.  Novelty is NOT a limited resource.
