Date First Watched:  2023-12-08
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I'm surprised about this one.  A piece of anthro fiction that I never watched?

Yeah, I'm really shocked this was new to me.  This seems like a movie I would've enjoyed more if I'd seen it as a kid.  It was still okay, but...  I can actually feel that I'm not in the target audience anymore.
