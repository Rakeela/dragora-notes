I need to reread [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]].  This is essentially a note-to-self.  I need my whole degree program to pay off in order to actually create the research item that link is for, but that link is why I'm doing it, so I should reread it occasionally.  I could still be adding links to it.  For instance, I've encountered at least two links since simply describing schizophrenia as an immunological disease, and I could start accumulating a less ambitious essay under [[authors-nonfiction]]

While I'm here, I'll link [[a-general-protocol-for-tolerogenic-rna-vaccination]] because that's what I need for immunoresponse tuning.  I think I'll create a node for that: [[immunoresponse-tuning]].

I need to reread all this stuff.

Headline: "Automating Aseptic Manufacturing of Autologous T-Cell Therapies"

This is for T-Cells not dendritic cells, but it's very exciting nonetheless.  Directly interfacing with the immune system in an automated way should bring new treatments to market.
