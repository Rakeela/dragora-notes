7:14.  I got up at 4:38 and I've been faffing about catching up on Discord for hours.

7:15.  105,246.

7:46.  Credit 4,580 words edited.  105,406.

9:44.  Credit 3,849 words edited.  105,800.

10:02.  Credit 1,561 words edited.  105,912.

13:16.  Whoa, what have I been doing?  106,300.  I did some writing, then I got distracted.  I played three rounds of Race for the Galaxy (and recorded one: [[Preserved-Race-for-the-Galaxy-Tableaus]]).

14:13.  106,716.

14:31.  I've been pretty much feeling 'done'...  I completed another pass of edits.

16:40.  I put an unusually long session in on The Ascent.

16:42.  Ugh, I wasn't exactly excited to do that, I just don't know what to do next.

18:15.  12.2 miles.  2,140 kcal.  44,925 steps.  9 hours, 30 minutes, and 13 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.

19:10.  Life is an endless progression of things to do.  There are too many things to do.  I got bored for a bit earlier on, but boredom was a symptom of uncreativity and disengagement rather than a true lack of vital tasks to pursue.

20:56.  Oh, I forgot to mark my starting on the next file.  817 words.  Kelmori's Folly.
