I've been told that I have a spiritual affinity with possums.  Don't bother asking who said it; nobody will ever admit to it.  It doesn't bother me, as such things go, though I've no idea what it means.

As far as I know, nothing of the rest of what's in this day-log is about possums.

I've been assigned a lot of incorrect labels in my life.  I've been hated by people radically more powerful than me, who seemed to hate me for thinking beyond my station in life.  Since I was never important enough to be accused, acknowledged, or subject to anything but gaslighting hatred for the "narcissism"... I guess of being liberal without the social status to be permitted in liberalism... my best clue as to what I was hated for are the incorrect labels I've been assigned.

I really want my civil rights back, from a hazard that shouldn't have happened, which I'm not to ever admit to, but which apparently has the omnipotence of God almighty and can overwrite liberalism forever.  Despite being a lifelong pacifist liberal, I'm to "learn to lose".  Now, that was supposed to mean "learn to lose to liberalism", but the problem is I'm liberal, so what really happened is that liberalism lost.

I'm supposed to learn to lose by admitting that I'm a fascist authoritarian, but I'm not.  I was an ideologically-oriented child.  I loved my father and my mother for talking politics to me.  I was extremely idealistic.  My ideology was egalitarian capitalism.  I was a libertarian.  I believed that libertarianism could support both science and equality.  This is an improbably broad position, but 1) I still believe in some of it, and 2) I'm talking about a grade schooler here.  I was very emphatically anti-authoritarian.  So no, I am not going to "learn to lose" in a way that's emotionally convenient to people who stomped on me tyrannically.  That would be stomping on the heart of a child for the comfort of people old enough to know better and powerful enough to have no credible need of it.

A combination of liberal anti-authoritarian activism and trying to stand for better standards of parenting than I was allowed to hope for got me targeted for destruction by natalists throwing tantrums that I value child welfare above natalism, and they do not, and never will, and are limitlessly willing to punish people who think like I do about the subject.  They're God, and God wants to abuse children.  End of story.  I lost.

In childhood, I disliked sexualized culture.  I disliked a particular kind of crass sexualization most of all.  I mostly disliked rap music, though it showed up in other contexts.  You could say I disliked sexual objectification.

I disliked more broadly the idea that sex was the purpose of life.  My father praised sex, my mother condemned sex, both of them said sex was inevitable.  My teachers in public school taught me that all culture is about sex and the purpose of wealth is to gain reproductive opportunity.  This heavily factors in my interpretations of the Commonwealth in The Viceroy.  It factors in my opposition to natalism.  I'm not willing to give up being who my younger self needed.

Society is better about asexuality now than it was then.  I wish it'd been better about asexuality then, too.  As it was, I was told that asexuality doesn't exist.  I got this message from both parents, culture, and (most unforgivably) the public school system.  So I decided that I would need to make peace with sexuality.

Which turned out to be the first way anyone else in my life **ever** acknowledged me as an anti-authoritarian.  All I had to do was submit to authority in the matter of sexuality.

As I said, making me lose meant liberalism lost.  It hasn't lost the war.  Society is better in many ways.  It certainly lost a battle.  I was supposed to be against it; I wasn't.  All I wanted were my rights.  Now, all I want are my rights.  I am a lawful dissident, and so I shall remain.

The Viceroy has given me something precious.  Panarchism binds the ideology of my childhood with the ideology of another world.  The society of the [[Northern-Creche-Confederation]] was a mixture of Panarchic and Commonwealth ideology.  We were panarchists, in that every [[dragon]] was as a sovereign nation, negotiating their own place vis a vis all others.  Many governments overlapped between us.  We had not laws, but treaties of alliance.  Our system of governance bound all, only because all agreed to be bound.  It bound different people differently, because different people agreed to be bound in different ways.

We were also Commonwealth, in that we sought to defend our nations, our liberties, and our families, which were our great weapon against all threats.  The common term of alliance binding our society together was built upon natalistic policy.

We should've been purer panarchists.  Kairn was a purer panarchist.  Born under less threat, he lived openly, and sang in his Cathedral for all who attended.

We believed we knew the mind of the unborn, and that we were raising children in the best way possible to prepare them for a dangerous world.  That's the problem with natalism.  The God of Natalism is built on the crying of children who are raised under threat.

In The Viceroy, the ultimate achievement of the Panarchic Ritualists is "The Commonwealth Falls!"  Yet I see no reason why in the logic of the setting the Panarchy and the Commonwealth could not persist indefinitely, as the Panarchy applies *no limits whatsoever* on what ideologies may exist under it, save that all Panarchic governments must be non-exclusive and must operate with respect for the consent of all they govern.  Why then would the Commonwealth fall if the Panarchy grows too strong?  We can see that they are willing to be non-exclusive.  What then would they be doing wrong?

It might be that they don't operate with respect for the consent of all they govern.  I see also another possibility: the Commonwealth cannot survive if it cannot hold the Panarchy beneath itself.  

The Panarchy is neutral.  In order to have 'every pattern of government' under it (pan-archy meaning 'all kinds of -archy'), and to fulfill its ambition of perpetual reform, it has to maintain emotional objectivity as best as it can.  Panarchists can only have great partisan hatreds on the cultural stage; if they really think that way, they're not panarchists at all.  The will of the panarchy is against hatred.  The opposite of a panarchist is someone who believes that disagreement should be extirpated.  So for the Panarchic Ritualists to *threaten* the Commonwealth...  That can't really come from the Panarchy.

It certainly could come from the Commonwealth.  Look at human history.  Look at all the conservative movements that have been violently, murderously dedicated to destroying threats to youth.  Look at Nazi Germany, even!  They were destroying "degeneracy" so that they could make room for "good German families".  They were nationalists who needed living room for natalism.  They believed in the justice of their cause and fought for the happiness of the German people.  The fascists famously even made the trains run on time, a classic (and indeed of itself virtuous) test of urban planning.  They believed in very professional public services.

Yet we don't have trouble admitting that they really were very, very authoritarian.

People who think that disagreement threatens the way they raise their children *do* tend to believe that disagreement should be extirpated.  If you look at the collective history of nationalist/natalist organizations throughout history, who were willing to immensely empower the state to improve law and order, you see a lot of organizations that were quite excited to extirpate disagreement.

All throughout history, you also see their children crying, and their societies filling with hard-faced dissidents.

I don't think it's coincidental that massive bigotry rose up when people turned too hard towards Commonwealth ideology IRL.  I think the nationalist/natalist complex is an authentic danger of human psychology.  I think if we work too hard to empower 'the virtuous people', we will create over-authoritarian states again and again.  It's better to advance by libertarianism and voluntary order as much as possible.
