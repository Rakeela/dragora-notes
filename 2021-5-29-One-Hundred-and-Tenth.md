I've been told that I have a spiritual affinity with possums.  Don't bother asking who said it; nobody will ever admit to it.  It doesn't bother me, as such things go, though I've no idea what it means.

I've been assigned a lot of incorrect labels.  I really want my civil rights back, from a hazard that shouldn't have happened, which I'm not to ever admit to, but which apparently has the omnipotence of God almighty and can overwrite liberalism forever.  Despite being a lifelong pacifist liberal, I'm to "learn to lose".  Now, that was supposed to mean "learn to lose to liberalism", but the problem is I'm liberal, so what really happened is that liberalism lost.

A combination of liberal anti-authoritarian activism and trying to stand for better standards of parenting than I was allowed to hope for got me targeted for destruction by natalists throwing tantrums that I value child welfare above natalism, and they do not, and never will, and are limitlessly willing to punish people who think like I do about the subject.  They're God, and God wants to abuse children.  End of story.  I lost.
