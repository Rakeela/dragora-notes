Merry Christmas!

I finally get to eat my candy hoard.  I didn't end up keeping the fast to today, so I didn't end up cataloguing the whole stash in regular order.  Instead, what I'm going to do is that I'm going to run it down as I eat it.
1) Peeps Gingerbread Men.  Marshmallows.  140 calories.  Ooh, they actually taste like gingerbread!
2) Cadbury Flake.  Chocolate bar.  168 calories.  What a mess this is to eat, I had to fetch out a plate to avoid getting chocolate crumbs everywhere.  It's delicious.  This fall-apart chocolate melts very quickly in the mouth.  Good first impression, bad aftertaste that seemed to get worse as it lingered.
3) Niagara Chocolates Double Chocolate Mint Cups.  As described.  120 calories (per serving; eating one).  Center is not liquid as depicted, but is a soft minty chocolate solid.  Interior does melt readily in the mouth, while shell of cup resists melting.

That's breakfast.  Today will be a day for an absolutely irresponsible amount of calories... but I'm already looking forward to eating something that isn't sweet.  So I've heated up three pre-cooked falafel (187.5 calories).  Maybe today I'll log everything I eat and we'll find out how much I'm eating.
