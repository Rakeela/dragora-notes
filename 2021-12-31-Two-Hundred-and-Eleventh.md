I fast, and I don't fast.  I don't fast spiritually, but I do fast medically.  I eat fast-simulating diets which provoke my gut into starvation mode.  I can eat a surprising amount of keto snacks and/or vegetables without violating this kind of fasting.  I try to keep to a target of 400 calories.  I don't think I succeed very well, but my weight still goes down rapidly as I try this.

Lately, I have embarked on a 666 hour fast.  That is 27.75 days of fasting.  I have currently gone through 126 hours of it, or 5.25 days of fasting.

I can happily report something that most people who are fasting cannot: steamed broccoli tastes pretty good with garlic.  Also, I ate half a cabbage raw earlier today.  Cabbage is very flavorful, but I get the impression it has a bad reputation for some reason.
