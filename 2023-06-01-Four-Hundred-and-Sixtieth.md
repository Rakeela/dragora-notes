6:42.  I've been up for an hour and I feel like nothing's gotten done, though I did write a post corresponding with my favorite author on a Discord server.  I feel like that was important.

7:38.  Okay.  I've finished all the stuff I like to do before doing productive things.  Now, I've also got a dentist appointment today, so that will be a further crimp on my productivity, but let's see what I can get done.

8:32.  I've been arguing online.  I was upset by a "glitch" on a website I use which made me wonder if someone was messing with my account, so I focused that upset on arguing.

8:48.  More arguing.  I'm distracted this morning.  Let's get to work.  34,637.

8:57.  I flossed and brushed my teeth.  Upcoming dentist appointment and all that.  I was super looking forward to breakfast this morning, but I've realized that it might be impolite to the dentist to eat *right before going*, so I'll save eating until afterwards.

9:26.  34,912.  287 words on the chapter.

9:38.  35,094.  469 words on the chapter.

11:38.  I need to stop buying cookies.  They're too tempting.

12:04.  Getting back to work is proving elusive.  I'm so tired.

12:07.  I think, without reviewing my records (I don't think they cover this point), that I have about a 2/3rds chance of a very productive day when I wake up quite early.  The remaining 1/3rd is the chance that I'm too tired to be productive.

12:45.  I am so tired.  I laid on the couch for a bit.  I rested my head on my desk for a bit.  I went to the store and picked up a medicine refill for a bit.  Okay, one of those is not like the others, but I think the point is established.

12:46.  As usual, I'm eager to get back to Kaire, and having trouble with Kura.

13:35.  35,660.  1,035 words on the chapter.

15:29.  35,986.  1,361 words on the chapter.  I'm breaking with the first draft more severely this time...

16:14.  36,630.  2,005 words on the chapter.

17:20.  37,423.  2,798 words on the chapter.  Running out of runway.  I'm liking writing this, at least.

17:40.  37,628.  3,003 words on the chapter.  Whoops.

17:41.  37,623.  2,998 words on the chapter.  Got it.

17:44.  37,630.  3,003 words on the chapter.  I rewrote something and it got a little longer.

17:45.  37,621.  2,994 words on the chapter.  Trimmed something else to get under the target again.

19:51.  38,655.  1,017 words on the chapter.  4,018 words of progress.

20:24.  38,984.  1,346 words on the chapter.  

20:55.  39,245.  1,607 words on the chapter.

21:46.  40,194.  2,556 words on the chapter.  Running out of runway.  I love writing Kaire.

21:55.  40,367.  2,729 words on the chapter.  

22:09.  40,567.  2,918 words on the chapter.

22:18.  40,640.  2,991 words on the chapter.

22:20.  40,649.  3,000 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete.

22:23.  40,648.  2,999 words on the chapter.

22:24.  40,650.  New chapter.  I think I'm done for the night.  6,013 words written.

23:01.  Now what?  I'm awake, focused, freshly showered, and done for the night.  I don't want to do anything except go to bed and I am emphatically in the wrong state for that.  Too energetic.  I don't want to play any games.  I've got books to read, but I don't want to read them.

23:03.  I thought today would be a day when I would be too tired to be productive, but instead I was focused all evening and I broke my 2023 writing record.  I haven't written 6k words in a day yet until today.

23:05.  The whole left side of my head hurts, from my ear to my jaw.
