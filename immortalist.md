# Immortalist

Immortalists believe that indefinite extension of individual consciousness is both possible and desirable.  All immortalists are [[transhumanist]], [[posthumanist]], or crazy; there is no way to achieve indefinite life extension without altering the human form!

Immortalism will require, and I believe people will very naturally adapt to maintain, a gentler and more long-term attitude towards the issues that face society.  This will greatly ease [[existential-threat]] contemplation.
