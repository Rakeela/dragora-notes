Taking down hygiene hazards with good immunoresponse control might take some of the raison d'etre out of restrictive social norms.  I was thinking about what restrictive norms might have been accomplishing historically, and I realized that (reminiscent of my thoughts in [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]]), something that they might have been controlling was the influence of eosinophilic or otherwise neuroinflammatory influences.

This is a restatement of something I already believed about the long-term societal implications of advancing hygiene and medicine: as pathogenic pressures decline, medical barriers between people are inclined to loosen.  It is also a potential advancement of that thought, as it adds the concept that chronic neural inflammation consequent to blood-brain barrier damage caused by eosinophile activation may have been a target unknown of prior social behavior structures which were designed based on beliefs about conducts preservative of social order.

I can only mark it as a potential advancement.  I cannot presently know how strong the structure of thought that I'm currently creating is.  I've been working in development of a conjecture that neuroinflammatory disorders are a substantial contributor to 'chaotic' neural processes and that control of neuroinflammation will therefore achieve therapeutic objectives.  I'm aware of many things I do not know, such as (in particular) the actual degree of influence on the blood-brain barrier that eosinophiles have.

Of all [[Warlockisms|the sentiments that I gave to Warlock]], I think my favorite is "People escape through narrow gates, and are pursued through broad ones."  I haven't found the use for it yet in the character's own context, but I like to think about it.  This phrase refers in an obscure way to the similarities and differences between people.  What is a narrow gate upon the likenesses between people?  What is a broad gate upon the likenesses between people?

I don't know.  I can say that one way that I have thought about it is that the achievements in the game Hyper-Rogue have always struck me as "a narrow gate", in that each one is a likeness to relatively few people, who have all spent time performing specific unusual mental operations in order to get them.  Another way perhaps is that specialization is a narrow gate; if a person has unusual troubles, the positions into which they fit most exactly are the least likely to accommodate trouble following after them.
