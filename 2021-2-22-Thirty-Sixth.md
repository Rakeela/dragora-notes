Taking down hygiene hazards with good immunoresponse control might take some of the raison d'etre out of restrictive social norms.  I was thinking about what restrictive norms might have been accomplishing historically, and I realized that (reminiscent of my thoughts in [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]]), something that they might have been controlling was the influence of eosinophilic or otherwise neuroinflammatory influences.

This is a restatement of something I already believed about the long-term societal implications of advancing hygiene and medicine: as pathogenic pressures decline, medical barriers between people are inclined to loosen.  It is also a potential advancement of that thought, as it adds the concept that chronic neural inflammation consequent to blood-brain barrier damage caused by eosinophile activation may have been a target unknown of prior social behavior structures which were designed based on beliefs about conducts preservative of social order.

I can only mark it as a potential advancement.  I cannot presently know how strong the structure of thought that I'm currently creating is.  I've been working in development of a conjecture that neuroinflammatory disorders are a substantial contributor to 'chaotic' neural processes and that control of neuroinflammation will therefore achieve therapeutic objectives.  I'm aware of many things I do not know, such as (in particular) the actual degree of influence on the blood-brain barrier that eosinophiles have.

Of all [[Warlockisms|the sentiments that I gave to Warlock]], I think my favorite is "People escape through narrow gates, and are pursued through broad ones."  I haven't found the use for it yet in the character's own context, but I like to think about it.  This phrase refers in an obscure way to the similarities and differences between people.  What is a narrow gate upon the likenesses between people?  What is a broad gate upon the likenesses between people?

I don't know.  I can say that one way that I have thought about it is that the achievements in the game Hyper-Rogue have always struck me as "a narrow gate", in that each one is a likeness to relatively few people, who have all spent time performing specific unusual mental operations in order to get them.  Another way perhaps is that specialization is a narrow gate; if a person has unusual troubles, the positions into which they fit most exactly are the least likely to accommodate trouble following after them.

I feel like a lot of society is built around giving people the connection points to follow useful strains of thought.

Grim sci-fi thought.  Imagine a dystopia where a vital human service is the "Known-Actual Verification Service", and the KAVS sends out agents to meet with random people who use the internet.  Their agents specialize in information security and work to guarantee that at least some subset of the internet can be verified as "known actuals" - real human beings who are really using the internet in the way they apparently do, without bot-substitution, modification to their usage profile by hackers, or other forms of criminal interference.  Some people, dubbed "Semi-actuals", would be hybrid users who acknowledge both an individual profile and a bot-substitute.

A meta-point, never made explicit in the story:  Almost every IRL person would qualify as a "semi-actual" or "non-actual" by the standards of the KAVS agents, because we *have* no KAVS agents to verify end-user infosecurity, and curated preference profiles for marketing and/or abusive imitation are gathered on all people nonconsensually.

I wonder if an artificial upwelling could be created by sinking a nuclear reactor in the ocean under a station turning a slow, massive propeller arm.  Could this be done to enhance fishery productivity by returning deep sea nutrients to economically important biomes higher in the water column?  What effects would consistent access to cold water have on precipitation elsewhere?  Could this be used to regularize the operation of critical oceanic currents?  Could this be used to cool the surface seas, dampening ice melt, or would impaired precipitation from lowered surface temperatures result in fewer snowstorms at extreme latitudes and increased wind-sublimation of ice?  Could this be used to impair severe weather conditions, or would deploying cold sea upwellings against warm-sea regions impair the operation of critical ocean currents?  Could this method be used to increase algae production at sea for the purpose of sinking carbon faster, noting also that the colder water at the surface will dissolve more carbon dioxide?

Page 283, The Ethical Slut.  "Boys learn that sex is a commodity that you get from another person."

As a boy on Earth, what *I* learned was that sex was the end-all goal around which life was supposed to be oriented, the only reward men could need or want towards which the acquisition of all other rewards was ultimately oriented, and indeed (though not by these words) that sexual service was the whole purpose of the male human lifeform.  Part of why I preferred Church was the *absence* of that stuff, which in *my* childhood was *secular* or *weird*.

Treating men as wanting nothing but sex is, quite literally, sexual objectification of men.  It deprives men of the emotional reality of all their other motives.

Facing (what I perceived to be) my gender's social role as a child, my response was trusting and obedient...  kind of...  Maybe.  My response was the draining of my will to live, but certainly I didn't doubt the wisdom of it.  My dad had praised limitless specialization potential in the markets and their ability to absorb new people profitably, and so had a number of libertarian thinkers I admired.  *He* was never against sex.  Almost nobody was.  I got mocked once or twice for denying that all motives reduced to sexual, and there was a girl at school who was called "prude"...  Well, I mentioned that 'my' response was the draining of my will to live, but there's a sense in which that was never 'my' response.  That kid with the draining will to live...  eventually died of it, apparently.  I'm someone else, who inherited that memory skein and then started crying for it.  *My* will to live is much stronger.  My response was nevertheless *also* trusting and obedient, but with my much stronger will to live I was willing to try.  After all, sex had *not* been a big deal about the Wheel...  Being human would be okay, right?

When all of the motives of a category of people are considered to reduce to sex, what happens to the people in that category if they'd rather say no?
