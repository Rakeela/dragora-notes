Taking down hygiene hazards with good immunoresponse control might take some of the raison d'etre out of restrictive social norms.  I was thinking about what restrictive norms might have been accomplishing historically, and I realized that (reminiscent of my thoughts in [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]]), something that they might have been controlling was the influence of eosinophilic or otherwise neuroinflammatory influences.

This is a restatement of something I already believed about the long-term societal implications of advancing hygiene and medicine: as pathogenic pressures decline, medical barriers between people are inclined to loosen.  It is also a potential advancement of that thought, as it adds the concept that chronic neural inflammation consequent to blood-brain barrier damage caused by eosinophile activation may have been a target unknown of prior social behavior structures which were designed based on beliefs about conducts preservative of social order.

I can only mark it as a potential advancement.  I cannot presently know how strong the structure of thought that I'm currently creating is.  I've been working in development of a conjecture that neuroinflammatory disorders are a substantial contributor to 'chaotic' neural processes and that control of neuroinflammation will therefore achieve therapeutic objectives.  I'm aware of many things I do not know, such as (in particular) the actual degree of influence on the blood-brain barrier that eosinophiles have.
