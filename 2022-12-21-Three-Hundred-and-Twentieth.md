228.5 hours.  I've eaten a breakfast of veggie rolls and shrimp.  I am not breaking fast yet.  The calorie burden should be low enough for me to continue on in the fast.  At the same time, I am not sure how much longer I will last.  I have been so stressed lately.

My weight is lower still, of course.  My pants fit better.  But I'm so tired of fasting.  It narrows my world to a constant struggle.

I now think pushing fasts beyond 10 days is a mistake.  I don't want to go over the 10 day line.  I've read that it increases the risk of refeeding syndrome.  I want to do many smaller fasts.  That was how I lost a bunch of weight the first time.

230 hours.  I'm done.

Bleh.  Now that I've eaten something, I feel at once overfed and still hungry.  I'm already looking forward to my next fast.

Ugh.  So tired.  Exercising didn't lift my energy level.  Gaming for a while was just a timesoak.  Sleeping didn't lift my energy level.  I haven't been able to work on writing at all.  I'm exercising again instead.  Exercising and thinking about religion.  I'm glad I'm not a religious faster.  I'd really feel like I'd failed God if I broke a fast early.

This is not abating.

1,573 words on the file.  466 word target.  Have to keep up daily progress on this, even if I don't feel well.  I won't get the "hit par every day" badge, but I should be able to get the "update progress every day" badge.

1,830 words on the file.  257 words of progress.  I just realized that I forgot all about one of my characters in my current scene.  All through this 1,830 word file, events go on to which *one more character than I remembered to write* would be present.

1,954 words on the file.  381 words of progress.  85 words remain.  This file is done.  I'll start another one.

292 words on the new file.  673 words of progress.  I'm turning it in.  Maybe I'll keep going.
