8:46.  I am wearing shorts under pants, a shirt, and two sweaters.  I am still a little cold.  Being cold in the mornings frequently bothers me and is one of the things that prevents me from getting up early.  Despite how much time I waste in the mornings - several hours without fail - getting up earlier still presages a more productive day, since I still get to work earlier as a result.

9:13.  I finished a draft of Taltios' Travelogue yesterday.  Now I'm discombobulated.  I guess I should read Pridelord.

11:50.  Part of what makes it hard to maintain fasts is that I have psychotic symptoms that get worse if I fast.

12:30.  I ate something I didn't enjoy much until I didn't enjoy it at all anymore.  Gluttony isn't necessarily hedonic.  It's just compulsive.  I kinda want a brain implant to regulate that.  It seems like such a thing should be possible.  There are times when I want to feast and greatly enjoy it, but today wasn't one of those times.

14:18.  Still feels like morning.
