This should be the last daily update on my word count... unless I keep working like this throughout the creation of my third manuscript.  I need to take a break and reread what I've got, though.  That won't produce a day of much output.  I'm afraid I've been boring.  I'm sure I need to carve down what I've written.  These chapters are so overweight.  They'd be slow to read through despite not a lot happening, or at least that's the impression that I have.

Anyways.  One last day in which I am very definitely targeting 1,667 words.  1,809 words on the file.

Adjusting a prior file.  8,197 words on the file.  8,218 words on the file.  21 words of progress.

2,752 words on the file.  943+21 words of progress, or 964.  703 words to go.

3,123 words on the file.  1,335 words of progress, 332 to go.  A scene overstayed its welcome.  It's likely to be chopped on editing, but it was kinda fun. 

3,705 words on the file.  1,917 words of progress, 250 over quota.  I think I'll stop here for tonight.
