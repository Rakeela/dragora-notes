11:04.  I walked 4.3 miles yesterday.  783 kcal.  16,359 steps.  3 hours, 37 minutes, and 28 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.

12:01.  64,682.  Back to Greeve's Ambition.

15:15.  64,682.  It's okay.  Another day without progress is okay.  Argh!  I just feel like my writing is so bad.  I don't want to continue the story.  I don't know that I'd want to read this story if I were reading it.

15:17.  I don't know what to do for Kura's side of the story.

21:02.  I kinda feel like I only have so much goodness at any given time.  I've been avoiding sweets now, but I've been over-eating despite avoiding sweets.  I've been drinking more alcohol - vodka, which I used to hate - as well.  Cutting sweets took some of my limited supply of goodness.  Soon I'm going to see if I really do have a limited supply of goodness, because I'm going to restrict my alcohol consumption while resuming regular fasting while still cutting sweets.  I worry that I'll be able to do nothing but suffer.

22:59.  65,365.  683 words of progress.  I'm not sure if I'll get any more done tonight.
