# The Personality Scavenge Service

The node: a crime that the customer believes unsolvable about which the customer believes nobody else knows

The message: “Dispatch team thinks we can reprocess this one into a levy of talent at crime writing, and they want permission to extend the clock.”

The response: “Always; we regard talent instillment as a bonus objective.”

It’s part of the rote. It’s just one of the many reprocessing potentials which gets rubber-stamped by the personality scavengers. Reprocessing potentials exist only where personality coherence metrics increase as a result, the idea being that increasing personality coherence means the customer is being helped to be more distinctly their own self in a beneficial way. Reprocessing this one seems to have a purely beneficial impact on mental health, though the crime genre has been getting rather frightening. True crime journalism attracts some of the most doggedly talented people in the field, and we know that’s our fault.

More than a few of us wonder what else might be our fault.

When the service learned to detect them, the reprocessable informational structures related to hopeless unsolved crimes did not distinguish between victims and perpetrators. We work in the abstract stuff of the personality, and it turns out that victims and perpetrators of crimes have a lot of the same scars in their minds. When we reprocess the thought processes related to those scars, we do a lot of healing work, and we’ve got good sociological research backing up our efficacy as an anti-crime intervention. Victims of crime are especially happier about what we can provide them, but the drop in crime rates among customers of our clinics is too large to be explained without some actual criminals turning lawful.

Talent instillment covered a lot of reprocessables. Purging information structures almost always registers a loss with our personality coherence metrics, but reprocessing covers the subset of alteration potentials which would increase coherence. By treating talent instillment as a bonus objective, we extended the workload for the dispatch teams, and ensured that repeat customers could receive more for their fees than pleasant reassurances of our system’s review of their mental health. We returned great value to people who had no urgent need for us, and only a charitable inclination and the love of public safety kept us expanding our service rather than raising prices to cater to an elite customer base.

The love of public safety, of course, is why some of us were less than thrilled to be removing the knowledge of crimes. Yet there was that good sociological research…. The knowledge of crime was not being removed from society, we reassured ourselves. We were only eroding the patterns of thought which could enable it.

Still, it could not be forgotten by those who worked in dispatch or the dispatch teams that they were hiding the evidence in the minds of people who were often the only ones who knew it.

People came to us to protect and enhance the modes of thought that they considered most important in their life; this was the trust that they gave to us when they went into our machines. Criminality was the most essential component of the thoughts of surprisingly few people. We couldn’t reprocess such nodes for police, soldiers, lawyers, some kinds of scientist, or anyone else whose actual job was conceivably related to actual criminal cases. We also couldn’t reprocess them for anyone who cited crime-related thought as part of their machine-assisted free will idealist surveys, but that was never a popular box to tick.

So we quietly scrubbed the knowledge of their crimes from grateful criminal after grateful criminal, reducing recidivism as we went. They went on to happier more lawful lives, with expensive twice-annual appointments at our clinics, and we could never tell them apart from people who were happier because we had lifted a rather different burden from them.

True crime journalism has been getting remarkably scary.
