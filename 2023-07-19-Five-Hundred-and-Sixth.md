9:47.  Credit 3,225 words of editing to Taltios' Travelogue.  Credit 33 words of writing.

12:57.  This book on Taoism is, like several other things I've read from Taoist authors, exuberantly heterosexual.  It is disquieting.  It's not disgusting, but it's unpleasant.  The content makes me wonder, "Is this misogynist?  Is this over-stereotyping men and women?"  It spiritualizes heterosexuality.  I don't think heterosexuality needs to be spiritualized.

13:08.  It seems sex-pressuring.  This material doesn't account for the existence of asexuality.

16:04.  My day got wrecked by a drama involving mostly people I don't know.  I've been fixated on it.  Morbidly fascinated.  Wondering, "Can I write a drama as gripping as this one?"  And...  no.  I don't think I can.

16:52.  This Taoism book will be badly dated if people overcome mortality.

18:13.  Credit 2,700 words of editing to Taltios' Travelogue.  Credit 23 words of writing.  Credit 3,517 words of editing to Taltios' Travelogue.  Credit 10 words of writing.  76,672 words on the file.

18:16.  76,719. 47 words of progress.  I'm not doing a quota run today, I'm just tracking how much I extend the story as I edit it.  This one needs to grow, not shrink. 

18:19.  76,742.  70 words of progress.

18:20.  Ugh.  I don't want to write any more.

18:31.  Credit 143 words editing.  76,761.  89 words of progress.  I've run into a conceptual problem in my writing that will probably require adding another chapter and rearranging information within the chapters.  This is a more ambitious edit.

18:39.  Okay.  I'm planning to do the bigger edit tomorrow.

18:40.  Let's tally up the 'credits'.  That's 9,585 words of editing and 155 words of writing.

20:40.  Equating childbearing and reincarnation is one of the most offensive things ANY text can do, and this Taoist book just did it.  We don't need to spiritualize reproduction.  It's spiritually vapid and compassionately negative.  We live in an overpopulated world.  Future generations deserve to live in a less overpopulated world, and that means reproduction should be limited such that future generations exist but are smaller.

20:54.  This ideal of returning to the Source seems sad and meaningless to me.  Death is an error.  It should be corrected.
