My god I'm so tired today.  I haven't been able to start on writing, and it's 1 PM on a day when I got up at 7AM.  I'm stuck in an unproductive loop of thought, too.  "I'm so tired, maybe if I eat something I'll get energy from food."  It doesn't actually work, but it seems to be a strongly wired instinct.

Going back to the store to buy an energy drink seems to have helped... even before I'd cracked open the energy drink to try it.  Just getting into motion seems to have helped.
