# Transhumanist

Transhumanists believe that humanity should be physiologically integrated with new technologies (genetic engineering and bionics) to improve the human condition.

In theory, a conflict could exist between transhumanists who believe that it is good to be human and [[posthumanist]]s who do not, but the causes are practically synonymously.

Transhumanism is commonly linked to atheism, but I don't know why it's seen as somehow necessary that a transhumanist also be an [[atheist]].
