#Viceroy-Birth-Death-or-Immigration

Something that I think about with these technologies is whether the population expansions (from increasing wealth or straight-up population expanders) are primarily from reducing death rates or primarily from increasing birth rates.  I'm going to tag these with dates so that I can observe my thoughts change more effectively.

Panarchist's Gift
+ Birth Rate Effect: Significantly negative
+ Death Rate Effect: Drastically negative
+ Immigration Pull:  High
+ Balance:  Reduces Deaths
+ Specific Dependency:  Negligible; effect rarely varies
+ Justifications:  Eliminating biological aging would delay reproduction and cause some people to see it as wholly unnecessary or even damaging given the overpopulation pressures that would result.  This would impair birth rates.  However, the death rate effect would be extreme.  Only some flavor of mishap would kill people after this.  So, of course, every life would end in mishap.  Also, people would crowd into any area where this service was medically offered.  They wouldn't necessarily stick around, but they'd definitely want to cruise into places where they could be rejuvenated, and some would stick around.

Telepathic Dust
+ Birth Rate Effect: Positive
+ Death Rate Effect: Slightly negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases Births
+ Specific Dependency:  High; different societies will see different effects
+ Justifications:  The telepathic dust technology manipulates emotions.  It's pheromones.  With this technology, people understand more about what emotions culture is supposed to evoke, and they feel those emotions more deeply.  They can also manipulate each other more effectively.  While there might be some gains in getting people to use nonviolent means of conflict resolution, I see this technology as primarily tending to juice the passions.

Panarchialization Policy
+ Birth Rate Effect:  Slightly Positive
+ Death Rate Effect:  Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Reduces Deaths
+ Specific Dependency:  High; different societies will see different effects
+ Justifications:  Encouraging diverse, vigorous, and competing government initiatives to widely empower people will, if it increases the wealth of society, also increase society's access to all of the things that keep people safe.  Fundamentally, the things people try to do with the government will be attempts to solve problems that are harming people.  Panarchialization will also make a lot of random people look good for having their ideas tested and found functional, while linking society together in all of these well-intended (probably utopian) endeavors, so that might create a few relationships that wouldn't otherwise exist, increasing birth rates.

Frictionless Highways
+ Birth Rate Effect:  Negligible
+ Death Rate Effect:  Slightly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  Well, I mean, it's roadway funding with an awesome new technology.  Supplies get where they need to be a little more reliably.  Maybe transport accidents kill fewer people?  A highly consumeristic society might use all its goods in mating displays, but I think most societies will see more death reduction than birth increase.  That said, a well-functioning logistics network, if it really improves the functioning of the economy, will create somewhere that people want to live.

Branching Facility
+ Birth Rate Effect:  Positive
+ Death Rate Effect:  Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Increases Births
+ Specific Dependency:  High; different societies will see different effects
+ Justifications:  I have a negative attitude towards homogenization.  I think this technology would be bad for the mental health of the people and the general order of their society.  By proliferating society with enthusiastic branchers, it would create an unappealing and chaotic society.  But there'd be more people in it!  It would settle at a higher population level.  Whether it was still a good society would depend on... everything else in that society.

Planned Urbanization
+ Birth Rate Effect:  Slightly Negative
+ Death Rate Effect:  Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Reduces Deaths
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  I think clean, orderly conditions are actually bad for reproduction.  I also think they're really good for lifespans.  Fighting the chaos of increasing populations keeps people alive longer and pushes back the mishaps of the Panarchist's Gifts, so that the population settles at a higher level.  This policy also draws migrants in by creating desirable places to settle.

Beyonder Engine
+ Birth Rate Effect:  Slightly Positive
+ Death Rate Effect:  Slightly Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  Easy energy will encourage the use of a lot of heavy equipment to solve problems.  All that heavy equipment will increase accident rates.  However, it will also provide the resources needed to live well, and people will be drawn to look hopefully on families.  The bigger issue however is that in regions with a vast energy reserve, people will flee energy shortages to come to them, going from places where energy is scarce to places where it is abundant.

Three Shift Society
+ Birth Rate Effect:  Slightly Positive
+ Death Rate Effect:  Slightly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  The three shift society would increase the acceptance of marginal chronotypes, concentrating people with dissident chronotypes into the districts instituting this policy.  It breaks the dominance of "morning people" and actually discourages them.  However, the people who are up late are likely to see increased accident rates, so some people will die as a result of this policy even though increased round-the-clock services will also save some others.

Artificial Wombs
+ Birth Rate Effect:  Somewhat Positive
+ Death Rate Effect: Sharply Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  This technology is looked on with fear and revulsion by many people, causing emigration from the instituting region and discouraging immigration to same.  However, it will dramatically increase the availability and quality of medical services to the public.

Holistic Industrialization
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Negligible; effect rarely varies
+ Justifications:  A straightforward investment in prosperity and industrial inclusivity, holistic industrialization tries to gently increase the productivity and workforce utilization of the entire public, lowering unemployment and poverty in the process of increasing society's available resources.  This lowers death rates and encourages immigration.  However, prosperity is negatively correlated with birth rates, and this professionalized fringe will live longer lives with wider spacing of births.

Palace of the Arts
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Somewhat Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  This investment in beauty glorifies the society that does it and attracts utopianist minds to engage in social experiments.  It supports education and makes immortality more appealing to its beneficiaries.  The death rate reduction effect comes from the reduction of suicide, madness, and violence.  The birth rate reduction effect comes from observation of the trends of highly educated and skilled artisans, who live longer lives with greater reproductive delays.  In violent or bizarre cultures, the death rate reduction may outweigh the immigration pull.

Eternal Bank Tower
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Slightly Positive
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency: Negligible; effect rarely varies
+ Justifications:  ROI maximization does not actually seem like a very effective way to increase Wealth in the model of The Viceroy, reducing all impacts.  However, superior banking regulations should reduce corruption in society and instability in the economy, making it more appealing for immigrants.  Nudging development levels upwards extends lifespans and reduces fecundity.

Fertility Drugs
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Sharply Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Increases Birth Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Negligible; effect rarely varies
+ Justifications:  Straight-up juicing the reproductive inclination of the public lowers the average age and increases the number of unprepared parents in society.  Population levels will settle at a higher average level, but the mishap rate along the way will increase.  Since this is a 'drug the public' policy, it will discourage some immigrants.

Orbital Hospitals
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Significantly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Drastically Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  High
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  A straightforward massive increase in medical intervention.  This has the same implications as The Panarchist's Gift: fewer natural deaths, more deaths by mishap.  Longer-lived people will space births more widely.  Even lowering infant mortality only temporarily boosts population, but actually lowers reproductive rates long-term.  This quality of medical care will also attract safety-conscious people from across the galaxy to seek to live in its area of operation.

Jaunting Grid (Literal)
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Somewhat Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency: Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  If you literally can install teleporters across a solar system, you eliminate most transport accidents in one swoop.  Some people will miss vehicles, others will want to live where they can travel long-distances very quickly, and on net there'll be more immigration.  However, this technology may fray communities, creating a restlessness in the people that encourages them to form untraditional and unfecund social groupings.

Jaunting Grid (Metaphorical)
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Increases Birth Rates
+ Specific Dependency: Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  My idea of how to interpret the jaunting grid metaphorically is to regard it as a society where people get rid of 'useless' travel infrastructure and instead 'jaunt' to places with entertainment products like books, photos, and videos.  This close, folksy population would be chaotic, like similar populations on ancient Earth; they would have more kids and more of those kids would die.  They would be unwelcoming to immigrants and unlikely to migrate themselves!  The population would settle higher, but it'd suck.

Seat of Beauty
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Somewhat Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  High; different societies will see different effects
+ Justifications:  The basic common effect of the Seat of Beauty is to professionalize artists and create a more completely comprehended understanding of what *is* beautiful, and thus what *makes* a good cultural product.  All efforts at producing objective beauty standards are intrinsically flawed and futile, however the *attempt* creates a fecund ferment that will make its area more distinctive.  Exactly what ideals an area settles on will however be idiosyncratic, partly as a result of self-expressive processes, and partly because the Seats of Beauty will inherently encourage differentiation as a source of cultural productivity.  This will make the Seats of Beauty have varied effects on the societies that host them.

Natalist Policies
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Drastically Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Significantly Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Increases Birth Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  There are an awful lot of societal factors that promote human reproduction, and most of them are terrible.  Directly manipulating them is the purest expression of an attempt at driving down the average age of society.  Chaos would increase.  However, some people appreciate this with horrific fervor, and a few immigrants would be drawn in.

Reproduction Mandate
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Significantly Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Increases Birth Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  Ugh.  Punishing non-reproduction is an evil choice that prioritizes reducing the average age of the population over actually producing a good quality of life.  This technology is chaotic evil, but less so than natalist policies, because some of the people who wouldn't ordinarily reproduce will do so in these societies, causing them to appear to be compliant members of the population who shouldn't be fucked with despite their dissident non-reproducer personalities.  There is likely however to be a drain of dissidents who prefer to move away from these hellholes.

Artificial Dreamtime
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Significantly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  Linking the entire world in a technotelepathic web would immediately shutter all but the most ethical agricultural facilities.  Many animals would learn to talk, so virtually nobody would hunt.  Bad families would be swiftly reformed.  Criminals and bigots would be faced with the distress of their victims as though it were their own.  The implications of this technology are so dramatic that it would drive away countless people who would be terrified with the forced empathy it provokes.  The net result of all this extreme empathy would be a reduction of death rates and a small increase in the romantic success of the population.

Mental Unity
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  High; different societies will see different effects
+ Justifications:  Linking the entire population's sense of intent and purpose will reduce criminality and increase the rate at which people can empathetically connect with each other.  It will also drastically reduce diversity of thought and discourage outsiders from joining the society.  The full effects of this technology will be highly idiosyncratic, as every system that implements it will come to its own understanding of the purpose of life and the correct intentions with which to promote it.

Panarchic Cathedral
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Somewhat Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Increases Birth Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  Resolving all religious disagreements in one great wave of even-handedness sounds amazing, but a lot of people would disagree with it and avoid the affected districts like the plague.  Since most faiths are violently opposed to each other, resolving their differences would reduce death rates.  Since most faiths seem to prioritize reproduction, promoting them all would increase birth rates.  On the balance, this should increase birth rates, but the specific mixture of religious thought in a given society will change the outcomes from this technology.

Panarchic Indoctrination:
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Significantly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Negative
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  High; different societies will see different effects
+ Justifications:  Art instruction is great, but universal art instruction that crosses all boundaries and teaches everyone to be part of every possible movement will confuse society, damage integrity, and stress people out.  Outsiders will avoid this; charitably, they will 'appreciate it from afar', as the affected societies will create many exportable cultural products (the proceeds of which can be used to buy the essentials of life).  However, it will also promote empathy, reduce criminality, and erode all sectarian conflicts.  The understanding that panarchic indocrination creates is not a complete understanding, as it is intrinsically uncertain, limiting the emotional connections that people can form with this ability.

Colonial Office:
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Increases Birth Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  Mutual colonization encourages a cultural ferment that is productive, but it also encourages conflicting parties to rub up against each other, increasing both chaos and relationship formation in society.

Hydroponic Farms
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Negligible
+ Balance:  Decreases Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  This technology is bizarrely pedestrian and realistic.  Improved nutrition should reduce chaos, while increased agricultural output should convince people that society is capable of supporting a greater population.  It shouldn't affect immigration flows either way, though conceivably immigrants might arrive from places with high food prices.

Distributed Desalination
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Significantly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Decreases Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  Aside from pulling immigrants from places where water is scarce, abundant water will also cool the passions and improve health outcomes.  Many chemical processes become economical when water is abundant, more finicky flora and fauna can be nurtured, and wilderness protection gains new tools, all of which diversify the range of biologicals a society with distributed desalination can produce.  When fully employed, this technology reduces chaos.

Seasteading
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Significantly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Decreases Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Negligible; effect rarely varies
+ Justifications:  Seasteads are unlikely to be highly attractive residences, but they make excellent places to host a diversely pluralistic collection of communities that seek each other even if they have to settle on the barren ocean to find each other.  This encourages society to self-sort in a safe, boundary-protecting fashion, and reduces chaos.

Deep Core Tap
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Increases Birth Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  Extending society deep into the depths opens up a massive amount of very questionable real estate while providing lots of resources with which to build and fuel civilization.  This increases the carrying capacity of the planets using this technology.  A few more immigrants will arrive from more impoverished places as well.  However, marginal real estate and volatile processes will kill a few people, and only on net will the population increase.

Orbital Habitats
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Somewhat Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  Highly marginal real estate, orbital habitats are inherently placed in places that will kill everyone if the support systems fail, where there are no natural resources with which to found the economy, and where medical problems are likely to proliferate.  Only a technically advanced economy can even support such structures.  Despite all these issues, some people will highly value these settlements and will preferentially immigrate to experience them, and space-dependent industries will be founded here, as will terrain-neutral ones.

Sentient Capital
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  "Self-deploying money" is a way to say "people whose only economic function is moving money around".  This increases the tolerance of sociopathic leaders for society, and the tolerance of society for sociopathic leaders.  I am not impressed.

Pervasive Digitization
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Significantly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Drastically Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Negligible; effect rarely varies
+ Justifications:  This breaks up plagues!  Biological contaminants can only threaten a few people at a time once this is in place.  Violent threats are likewise quarantined, as conflicts move to virtual reality spaces where the risk of accidental death is almost certainly zero.  Suicide would claim a greater fraction of the population after this technology is implemented, but even the average age at which people commit suicide would increase.

Predictive Supply Chain
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Significantly Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  A highly functional logistics network encourages professionalism, prosperity, and consumerism.  The ready access to consumer goods will attract migrants from across the galaxy to settle preferentially in areas set up for predictive supply chains.  However, these automated societies are likely to alienated and intellectualized, variously draining the passions or else feeding them in less than fecund ways.  The resources of life will however be more abundant, and chaos will reduce, lengthening lifespans.

Absolute Freedom
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Somewhat Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  High
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  High; different societies will see different effects
+ Justifications:  Increasing tolerance for bizarre fringes of society will reduce death rates as people will fall in with 'their own kind', and they're even likely to maintain multiple 'their own kind' groups as subcultural identification is unlikely to be exclusive.  This reduces hatred in society and proliferates high-empathy groupings, thereby reducing chaos.  Furthermore, since it reduces the incentive for conflict between societies, it will reduce war deaths as well.  However, the exact details of what a society regards as 'Absolute Freedom' will be different from one society to another, and some may see elevated chaos as they become 'free' to do all the wrong things!

Genetic Optimization
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Substantially Negative
+ Death Rate Effects:  Drastically Negative
+ Immigration Pull:  Small
+ Balance:  Reduces Death Rates
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may show different effects
+ Justifications:  In addition to greatly improving conventional yields, this will also improve the manufacturing of rare biological goods and medicines, as well as make available to the public the deployment of advanced genetic healthcare.  Heightened professionalization of agriculture under this regime will tend to drive out all subsistence work and result in agriculture being performed by extremely educated professionals, who will naturally space births more widely and who may even accept the importance (in an immortal society) of conserving resources through not reproducing at all.

+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  Tampering with the pregnancy process in severe-though-benevolent ways should reduce mortality and chaos in society, but it'll horrify all of the galaxy's traditionalists, driving off some of the demographics most prone to child abuse.  What a bonus!

Zero Gravity Farms

+ Immigration Pull:  Moderate
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may show different effects
+ Justifications:  What highly desirable farming jobs!  What highly educated farming jobs.  What dangerously isolated farming jobs.  These zero-G farms are likely to provide lots of isolated laboratory-grade environments for the manufacture of the most absolutely finicky biological goods imaginable.  Spreading society further across space and professionalizing to a still-greater extent will result in more birth spacing, and the unusually good farming jobs will attract migrants who want to become *elite* farmers with special accommodations.  It's important to note that death rates generally drop as Wealth levels increase, so if this technology is productively utilized, it will lower death rates.

+ Justifications:  I still treat this as a joke that involves "embedding" farmers into the landscape, and then treating farmers as biological computers.  There are other interpretations of this technology.  At moderate wealth, fungi.  At extreme wealth, nanotechnology.  In any case, farm culture involves having too many kids and then victimizing them, so this is a chaotic tech.

+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  What a nightmare nationalism has been on Earth!  Was Hitler an advanced proponent of Commonwealth economics?  Nationalists have always insisted on their own cultural potency, but when have they actually been beautiful?  What an ugly, high-conflict way to advance the 'strength' of a culture!  While it does lead to people having "more empathy" for each other, this is highly specific empathy for an in-group, and it actually increases friction with out-groups while causing people on the fringes to be targeted for abuse.  Nationalism increases populations primarily by encouraging populations to have soldier babies!  I could believe there's a better interpretation, but I don't know the better interpretation.

+ Specific Dependency:  Moderate; different societies may see different effects
+ Justifications:  An extremely spread-out society colonizing an intrinsically hostile environment like space?  Everyone gets a mansion even at extreme population densities, and there's space for absolutely every process that doesn't need a raw material extraction site, but...  it's spread-out and the terrain wants to kill you if things go wrong.  Services would experience extreme strain with the spacial distribution of these societies.  Chaos would increase, but populations would settle at a higher average level.

+ Death Rate Effects:  Slightly Positive
+ Immigration Pull:  Extreme
+ Balance:  Increases Immigration
+ Specific Dependency:  Negligible; effect rarely varies
+ Justifications:  This technology is pretty straightforward to imagine.  The biggest wrinkle is the effect on birth rates.  Immigrants are likely to come from places with terrible conditions, and human natalism is promoted by terrible conditions, so they're likely to be natalists.

Lord Economic
+ Birth Rate Effects:  Slightly Negative

+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  Giving the economy to a single person would create one stagnant, corrupted economy.  It's dumb.

+ Specific Dependency:  Small; effects may show variance
+ Justifications:  This involves handing the economy over to an economic elite who are presumed to be flawless guides of stability, and then having everyone else ape them so that investments rise steadily.  This is an inherently chaotic policy that will damage dissent, and it relies on having populations increase to add more rubes to the game over time.  It would attract migrants to the perception of stability.
