This is the earliest day in which the first of my order of dendritic cell textbooks might arrive.  I want to say I'm hyped.  Better to say I'm attentive.  I do want to read it very badly, but in general the idea of doing anything good for the world feels incomprehensible today.

Today, I want justice!  And I won't get it.  Like every other day in which I want justice.  The idea of valuing honesty and opposing obscurantism is treated as "superheroism" and "unrealistic utopianism", despite being the foundation of all modern society.  The idea of doing what we already know to work should not be "superheroic", just... normal.  We resist evil, because not doing so is ludicrously stupid and unsustainable, and the human species collectively tried not resisting evil for thousands of years already, only to burst forward with new vitality on every short interval of the defense of rights.

Yet we keep backsliding.  The people who argue that doing the right thing is "unrealistic" keep landing in power despite the fact that they're basically worthless for the role.  That's historically forgivable, as previous societies didn't know what they didn't know, but now humanity is technologically advanced enough that we should understand factually that those who tell "necessary" lies are not competent leaders.

I talked about politics at length today with Kistaro.  We disagree about a bunch of stuff, but we have interesting disagreements.  We expect each other to be intelligent and well-motivated in the matter of politics and society, so there's no hurled abuse involved.  Sometimes we persuade each other of things.

I can't say the conversation made me happy, but it made my day suck less.  I appreciate it, although I'm kind of horrified by the idea of trying to solve the problems of a species that is 60% incapable of algebra.

I'm doing the Concepts and Tools assignment for meteorology on the day it's due, again.  I learn more from the assigned work than from the lessons, but I have so many other things that I want to do, that I rarely work ahead.

This is conventionally "a bad habit", yet it seems to work well enough for me that I think if public schooling had been less willing and able to enforce my paying attention to each specific class in assigned sequence, I would've had much better results in public schooling.  If schools assigned work that was intended to be completed during the school sessions themselves, while making the actual lessons a matter of optional attendance, I think that would work better from an early age.

The assignment this time is about a particular public sensor system that I wanted to see exist, and which to some extent already does exist.  It's hard to focus on while I feel depressive, but I think I'll get it done.  That said, in terms of grade prioritization, I should blow this off instead of blowing off the env-sci discussion board post this week, but I'm markedly more inclined to study meteorology sensors than I am to write an essay for env-sci right now.

The env-sci discussion thread this week asks for individual reflections about what changes each student's household has made in response to the assessments of resource use that the env-sci class required the students to make.  This is already presumptive (how many students will actually have changed something?), but worse is that the teacher put their standard two citation minimum in the instructions.  I don't understand that; the citation demand looks faulty here.  If I'm reporting on what's happened in my vicinity, the source is me.  That means I know how to do the concepts and tools assignment, but I don't know how to do the discussion post assignment, and I'm prioritizing the immediately comprehensible work.
