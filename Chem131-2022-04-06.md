(Commentary:  I was working on my manuscript all day and I didn't get to moving these to their own sub-files yet.  I think I need to pull the archive on my home mac, too.  I feel appalling today, by the way.  I skipped the caffeine this morning and I feel like I shouldn't have.)

I need goggles for the lab on Friday.  It's not a "real" lab (Lab Safety session), but I don't have the lab goggles I need.  Acquiring a lab coat wouldn't be remiss, either.  "Old clothes" suffice for the university lab, but without a lab coat I have to risk one of my coats as a disposable/damageable coat.

...something about molecular forces?  I'm confused.  Why is this being discussed?  Dispersion forces are the weakest and most universal.  Dipole-Dipole Attractions are second weakest and exist only for polar molecules.  Hydrogen bonds are next, being a subclass of dipole-dipole attractions which occur when hydrogen is bonded to highly electronegative atoms of nitrogn, oxygen, or fluorine.

Cycloalkanes are cyclic alkanes.  They have two fewer hydrogens than the open chain form, due to carbons being linked to each other rather than to hydrogen.  They are named by using the prefix cyclo- before the name of the alkane chain with the same number of carbon atoms.

(Commentary:  I need to ask permission from the teacher to use potassium, or I need to use it surreptitiously...  I really do feel appalling, and my arms hurt.  "My arms hurt" isn't a caffeine-deficit symptom, it's a potassium-deficit symptom.)

Structural isomers have the same molecular formula as their parent alkane, but the carbon atoms are not in a linear chain.  They are connected in a different way.  Each carbon molecule can be connected to other carbon molecules instead of to hydrogen molecules.

(Commentary:  Notes on rules for naming alkanes with substituents omitted; I was doing the class activity at the time and referencing the book.  Seriously, it's all in the book.  Note however, I don't remember seeing this in the book: minimize the numbers.  Count the -ane from the side where the numbers are lower.)

When one substituent is attached to a carbon atom in a cycloalkane, the name of the substituent is placed in front of the cycloalkane name.  No number is needed for a single alkyl group or halogen atom.

Haloalkanes are alkanes with a halogen atom that replaces a hydrogen atom.  They are named by putting the substituents in alphabetical order.  Have the halo group numbered according to the carbon where it is attached to the alkane.  (While minimizing the numbers.)

(Commentary:  Ow, my arms.  Ow, my fatigue.  At this point it looks like I may last out the session...)

(Commentary:  Oh dear, there's a difference between the teacher and the book.)  Cycloalkanes are numbered with arogens (?) having priority over halogens.  So for instance, something the book labeled as 1-chloro-3-ethylcyclohexane has been labeled by the teacher as 3-chloro-1-ethylcyclohexane.

(Commentary:  My neck is weakening.  I need potassium.  Or for the class to end.  I'm impatient for that.  Is this really going to last another 40 minutes?  There is not 40 minutes of content left!)

(Commentary:  Having already mistaught the classroom, I think the teacher has decided to use what's in the book rather than what's in her slides.  I'm not sure at all though.  I think I prefer the rule in the book...  I foresee a missed test question in my future.)
