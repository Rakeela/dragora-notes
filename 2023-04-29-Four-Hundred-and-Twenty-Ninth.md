I'm canceling my "fast".  I've been too noncompliant with it the last few days.  I don't want to set a "record" like this.  It isn't fair play at this level of noncompliance.  I've been losing weight, but it's *really* just a diet at this level.  A successful diet, but not more than that.

One of the things that tempts me towards spirituality is that I feel like this world rewards me every time I take a baby step towards temperance.  I don't mean resistance to alcohol; I'm already good on that front.  I mean resistance towards food.

I tried a quick websearch on temperance, and I discovered that I do not know very much at all about how it is biblically defined.  I gain my limited understanding of temperance chiefly from [[Afterlife-1996]], wherein the rewards for temperance are great paradises of food and partying, many of which have somewhat questionable vibe impacts on heaven.  By reasoning that the chastity rewards grant romance to those who abstained from unlawful "romance" in life, I thought that the temperance rewards grant food to those who abstained from excessive consumption in life.

Bleh, I just had a Reese's Creamy Cup for the first time ever.  There's an aftertaste.  It's sticking to my mouth.  It gave a good first impression, but now I dislike it because it left me wanting to rinse my mouth.  Maybe running the [[Candy-Vault]] will encourage me to notice stuff like this and not rebuy things that aren't good.

The candy vault certainly encourages mindful consumption.  The whole foods assortment that I demolished first (before the 2 Reese's cups) was delicious.  The Matcha Green Tea White Chocolate tasted... familiar.  I ate half of it.  I would usually have eaten the whole thing, but now I want to leave half of it in my hoard for tomorrow.  I said it tasted familiar.  It was obviously a simplified flavor using white chocolate to avoid overwhelming the tea flavour.  I'm not sure I like it.  I'm sure I'm glad to hoard it.  I may restock and keep it for a long time.

If I'm going to hoard candy rather than impulsively consuming large quantities of it, I feel like I need a better storage solution for my candy stockpile than a few bags in a closet.  Is there anywhere that I can clear enough shelf space for a few shelves of candy?  I don't see room for that in the house, considering all the bookshelves.

I've eaten pizza for dinner, and both ice cream and a cupcake for dessert.  I didn't mention it earlier, but my breakfast was also a cupcake.  All in all, I feel like I've eaten too much today, and I feel kinda sick.  Yet here my training in temperance runs into a flaw, of sorts.  I like feeling like this, so it feels like all is right with the world.

If I were designing a perfect world, I wouldn't remove the slight sickness from over-eating, nor even the diarrhea from sugarfree candies, unless I removed all bowel movements as unpleasantness.  It would be a little easier to convince myself not to overeat if I disliked the feeling of having overeaten.

---
I did leave half of my pizza.  That shouldn't be a victory, but on reflection it kinda is.  I've often devoured the whole thing and felt even sicker.

I also showered immediately after Kistaro tonight.  Showering at the first opportunity rather than delaying until I was almost too tired made it much more pleasant.  Not to mention that showering right after Kistaro meant the water was already warm, so I took less time dialing in the correct temperature.
