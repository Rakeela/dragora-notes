16:47.  Oh, I finished with resetting the Patreon a while ago, but it did turn out to be hours of work.  See, I didn't just want to create some tiers, I wanted to collect an archive of all the art that I'd posted to the account.

16:48.  103,883.  The Fall of Foyis.  Starting on chapter 15.

17:26.  Credit 3,186 words editing.  104,028.

18:52.  I got pretty distracted with a porn game.  Not as bad as I sometimes do, as far as time melting and rejoining afterwards.  The game puts me into a trance state.  I appreciate it as an escape of sorts.

23:00.  104,408.  I haven't really been working much since the last timepoint; I was totally absorbed in a movie that I was watching.  For two hours?  No, only an hour and a half, but the half hour before it was taken up by showering!  Now I need to go clock in at Dreamland Inc.
