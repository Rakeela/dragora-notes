14:14.  I forgot to mark when I started work, which I think was about an hour ago.  I'm working on a file that started at 3,813 words.  It is presently 4,122 words.

15:37.  I finished the thing I was trying to accomplish today some time ago and then went to spread rhetoric on 4chan.  I managed to piss off the stalker types with anti-car rhetoric; they used targeted stalker rhetoric against me.  So the stalkers love cars?  Weird.

16:09.  Oh, I forgot to record what the final word count was for the thing I'd been working on.  4,338.  It's not exactly "done" given that it's the file for every nation on Slantworld, but I finished what I set out to accomplish today.  525 words of progress today.

16:11.  I am drunk, by the way.  My thoughts are inhibited.  I feel pretty sedated.  I didn't set my record for one-session drinking (that was the time I drank a bottle of wine to find out if drunkenness really distorted vision), but I did set my record for one-session whiskey consumption.  Wow.  A glass of whiskey on the rocks.  I didn't know it was safe to drink that much, but I measured it out...  It was about 5 standard drinks.  Not dangerous as far as I know.  Feels pretty good to be honest, but it's hard to engage with anything right now.

16:12.  I played two rounds of Democratic Socialism Simulator.  I love that game.  Now what?  I guess No Man's Sky.  Watch me lose my Permadeath save while drunk.
