Morning weigh-in: 253.4 pounds.  That's 5.4 pounds gained in one day.  Phew.  Well, I'm back to barely eating.

I spent yesterday eating and sleeping.  I overpacked the day with stuff to eat, and trying to eat that much totally ravaged my metabolism.  It would've been a more pleasant day if I'd eaten considerably less.

Oops.  I accidentally double-clicked on the pause button and I ended my treadmill session early.  I walked for 1 hour 56 minutes 13 seconds, crossing 2.2 miles at speed setting 1.2 mph, burning an estimated 427 kcal.  I'm using a more modest speed this time due to foot injuries from walking barefoot on the treadmill yesterday.

Editing target:  8,216 words.  Chapter 16, Doshler Part One.  Ekis' Travelogue.  This chapter is too long.  It needs either several thousand words of trimming, or it needs to be split.  It also needs a new name.

7,067 words.  1,149 words trimmed.  7,985 words to go on my 15k target.  That went well, but this chapter is still too long.  I need to find a splitting point.  There.  3,943 words for the first chapter.  3,124 words for the second chapter.  Wait, I see a little more editing to do.  That's 3,118 words for the second chapter.  6 words trimmed.  7,979 words to go on my 15k target.

The next chapter is 5,781 words long.  After editing, it shouldn't require a split.

5,387 words.  394 words trimmed.  7,585 words to go on my 15k target.  I couldn't trim as much this time.  I wonder if I did enough.

Is that enough for now?  I bet I could do another chapter.  I've edited 13,997 words.  It's kind of exciting to be recording that value.  The next chapter is 4,360 words.

4,279 words.  Argh, I could hardly trim this one at all.  I've edited 18,357 words now, but I'm dubious about the skill with which I did so.  I only trimmed 81 words!  I have 7,666 words left to go on my 15k target.  I think I'll stop for the night.

Evening weigh-in.  256.0 pounds.  I felt absolutely marvelous all day.  Constant energy, no desire to eat.  Somehow, I gained another 2.6 pounds while eating only two slices of pizza.

Conclusion:  I went seriously overboard yesterday.  Like wow.  There was MOMENTUM from how much I went overboard yesterday.  I felt pretty terrible yesterday, but the 'momentum' phase felt awesome.
