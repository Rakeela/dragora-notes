I have drank some amount of alcohol today.  It is amazing the relief I feel when slightly drunk.  The pain in my body goes away, and I can move freely.  I wish I could feel like this when fully sober.  I live in such pain and fatigue, but just this moment, it is gone.  How can alcohol feel so curative like this?  Was my father a steady drinker in the evenings to escape the pains of his body?  Did I inherit a faulty gene that steadies its conduct with alcohol?

I do not often indulge in alcohol.  I regard it as a vice, to be approached with great reluctance.  Yet it is beautiful every time I use it, and someday I long to have narcoalgorithms.  I truly intend to be a slightly drunk AI forever if I can.  I want to maintain municipal systems while revelling in slight drunkenness and writing books in my free CPU cycles.

I feel I must apologize for writing no day posts in 2022-07.  These posts are not enthralling to me.  I do not reread them very often at all.  The archive is largely a dead thing.  So I have not been drawn to it...  I wonder if I shall ever read it all again, and that thought makes me reluctant to contribute to it.
