115 hours.  I'm past the 1/3rd mark.  At Kistaro's prodding, I've eaten a protein-ful snack to try to mitigate muscle wasting during this prolonged fast.  I want to lose fat, not muscle.

I haven't started on writing.  I'm getting a late start.  I'm tempted to skip a day today.  Just skip it completely.  But I know it'll only interfere with the development of good habits to do that.  I need this first draft complete.  When I complete my December writing goal, it should be done.

Starting with a new file today.  Daily target: 660 words.

558 words.  102 words to go.

117.5 hours.  I found another source of candy in Redmond and acquired more for my stash.  If I eat it all in one day, I will surely get sick to my stomach, especially when paired with a glass of brandy eggnog as I intend.  I'm going to break fast in an unhealthy way... and then I'll be eating on stashed candy for days afterwards.

I think I won't repeat the fast until I'm done with a round of editing on my second manuscript.  It's been very hard to edit while fasting.  I'm not sure fasting is the problem, I feel like I'm just being hypersensitive, but Kistaro thinks fasting is the problem.  Hence prodding me to eat a *little bit more*, with a focus on protein.  I'm ordering some protein pastries to do this better.  I'll eat one every day for the next eight days.

119 hours.  I'm not exceptionally hungry.  I'm sort of lingering in a state of, "Eh, I kinda want to eat."  There's a bit of protective apathy.  Keeping the fast doesn't feel grievously hard anymore.

120 hours.  Today was a good day for writing, but I haven't done any editing at all.  I mentioned protective apathy an hour ago.  I take it back.  I want nothing more than to eat.  I'm pacing around longing for that protein pastry I ordered to arrive at my doorstep.  A small amount of ketogenic food...

Among the candy I bought was a Flake bar.  The tagline on it calls it, "The crumbliest, flakiest piece of chocolate".  I don't know what to expect for a texture, but I'm looking forward to trying it.  Apparently, it's an Irish chocolate.

I have so much chocolate.  I say I bought "candy", the vast majority of it is chocolate.  I also have "brown butter" chocolate.  What is that going to be like?  I know I love brown butter cookies.  Will brown butter chocolate have a similar taste and texture?  I think I've had it before, and it frustrates me that I cannot remember it.  Maybe someday there'll be a next gen anti-obesity implant that functions not by altering appetite, but by making taste memories reaccessible at will.  Imagine if you could taste things again and again, without eating them again and again.  There'd be no need to eat the same delicious food twice.

121 hours.  That protein pastry was VERY satisfying.  I feel like it woke up my digestion.  I was briefly full.  Now I'm hungrier than I was before I ate it.  Today I've eaten the largest amount of calories since I started my fast: 340 calories.  Today's calories were almost all fat and protein.  It should do nothing to rebuild my glycogen stores.  I hope it'll keep my digestion in ketosis.

I say I'm hungrier than I was before I ate it.  I'm also still feeling some lingering satisfaction.  The protein pastries are hyperpalatable despite being keto.  They taste amazing, especially right now..
