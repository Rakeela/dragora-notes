9:24.  Ugh, yesterday was so unproductive!  And I felt awful.  That discomfort alleviated later on, but I felt so sad.

9:25.  I couldn't think yesterday.  If it wasn't one thing, it was another.

9:27.  My dreams last night were total chaos.  There was one appealing interlude that involved a foursome with my spouse as an anthro dragon, a quadrupedal dragon who wasn't familiar to me, and an anthro crow, but otherwise my dreams connected concepts together in ways that made no sense.

9:50.  Nationstates time.

14:47.  I didn't spend all that time on Nationstates.  I also watched a video about Equestria at War, and studied more of the nations on the wiki, and even loaded up the game to look at the strategic situation.  I talked about it with some people on a discord that I'm on where a local VIP started playing the game recently.

14:49.  I've been struggling to have faith in my story.  I think I know what needs to happen next, but.

14:50.  20,965.

17:27.  23,421.  2,456 words of progress.

17:41.  I'm going to stop and play games instead.
