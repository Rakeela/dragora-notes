164 hours.  Closing in on the halfway point.  Ugh.  I want to not be fasting so badly.  I need to be editing The Turning Wind to improve its food descriptions.  I can do that, but it's so painful to write food while not eating.  It hurts my feelings!

1,133 words on the file.  Today's goal:  564 words.

Editing a prior file.  There are 1,527 words on the file.  1,530 words on the file.  No, I didn't just add three words, the net effect of the edit was a three word expansion.  That's 3 words of progress, and 561 words to go.  Back to the current file.

1,173 words on the file.  40 words of progress.  521 words to go.

166.5 hours.  I tried to buy marzipan stollen from the one store in town that carries it, only to discover they sold out earlier today.  I'll have to pick some up next year...  I don't think I'll order it online.  I bought a regular stollen instead.

I also bought still more candy.  I have spent so much on chocolate that I'm not sure eating regularly would have cost less.  I am not just looking forward to eating it, I am growing uncertain of eating it.  I know I will, but I wonder how long it will take.  I plan to catalogue my acquisitions in total on December 22nd, along with their calorie counts.  I may even plan out how many calories of chocolate I intend to eat on each day.  If I do, the numbers will be high!  The intention isn't to stop myself from eating it, after all.  It's just a thought inspired by the close recording I've been doing each day for a while.

1,374 words on the file.  241 words of progress.  323 words to go.  Awr, I'm so tired.  So distracted.  Fasting is taking everything out of me.

1706 words on the file.  573 words of progress.  9 words over quota.  I think I'm just going to turn it in.

170 hours.  I feel sick and my appetite has roared back in.  I think this happens when I extend fasts to 7 days.  I remember pushing through it in the past and still feeling sick and hungry on day 8.
