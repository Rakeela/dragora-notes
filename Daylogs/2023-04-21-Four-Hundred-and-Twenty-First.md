I ate so much yesterday.  I broke my fast.  I still added a few days of actual fasting first, but I decided that I didn't want to be fasting on my birthday.  So I dug into my candy stockpile, and ate half of a "ciao ciao" cake that I bought.  I also ate some vegetarian chili at lunch.  It was a very pleasant day, though I threw out a peanut butter chocolate bar for being just not very good.  Hammond's brand isn't great.  The Hammond's brand chicken and waffles chocolate bar was good though, it was very savoury and a bit salty.  I read the ingredients list three times to confirm there wasn't anything chicken-based in their "chicken and waffles" flavour, and there wasn't.  They were using vegetable ingredients to flavour the bar.

I had a lot of trouble getting out of bed this morning.  I ended up sleeping until 12:30.  I was just so tired.  I think the problem is that I slept on my back last night.  I sleep so much better if I sleep on my side.

I've been reading a textbook on Nonverbal Communication.  The section on hugs brought up bad memories and was hard to read.  The reading got more fun as it started to categorize types of touch.  It gave me the idea of refactoring my story "Kura and Kaire" to make Kura a tactile kobold.  I don't think I'll actually do that, but it's fun to have a new idea.  It drove me back to the story.  I've been avoiding K&K lately.

Chapter one of Kura and Kaire is 1,107 words.  It's noticable short.  I was thinking about extending it.

Aaand now it's 1,263 words long.  Grr.  I did think of one new scenelet to add, so I think the chapter is better than it was.  It's *less* underweight.  I still feel like it doesn't develop or introduce the community around Kura.  I'll have to find more ways to add community in the next Kura chapter, which is chapter three.  I want to show-don't-tell about the lack of compassion in Kura's environment.

Even though I'm supposed to be fasting, I ate a cheese and onion pastry from the local British import shop, The British Pantry.  It's their only vegetarian option.  I want to support that and encourage them to provide better service to vegetarians.  I don't fast religiously; it's common for me to eat one thing a day while "fasting".  I still lose weight doing this.

It's 4PM now and I weigh 244.7 pounds.  I wish I hadn't celebrated so much when my weight hit 239.5 pounds.  I ate a ton and quickly regained what I'd lost.  I haven't managed to get back under 240 since.  I should with my current fast though, I'm planning to fast until May 1st.

Chapter three of Kura and Kaire is 2,500 words.  This is exactly the target length of each chapter in the novel.  In theory, I should balance my additions and removals to end up with the same wordcount at the end.

...Argh.  I got hung up on something and didn't get anywhere.  I'm going to mark that I edited an additional 1,517 words, ending up with 1521 words.  Combining with my earlier totals, that means I edited 2,624 words and wrote 160 words.
