8:13.  I am atypically excited to get to work today.  59,046.

10:42.  60,954.  I feel like I've been making good progress so far!  I've got a lot of relatively straightforward writing to do this morning.  I know what I'm working on and I'm just plugging through it.

12:23.  62,265.  I know what I'm doing, yay.  3,219 words of progress.  There's a part that I don't understand coming up, though.  That'll slow me down when I reach it.

14:16.  187 words edited.  342 words edited.

14:23  237 words edited.

14:41.  325 words edited.

14:42.  1,091 words edited, cumulative.  That's adding together the numbers above.  I'm doing editing work on Weld and Rift.

16:53.  I have not been working on any of my creative projects since my last time-point.  That said, I did get to 62,582 words on the file between 12:23 and 14:16.

17:29.  62,721.

17:59.  63,319.  4,273 words of progress.
