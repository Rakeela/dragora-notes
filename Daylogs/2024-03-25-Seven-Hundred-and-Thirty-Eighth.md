12:07.  

12:49.  70,310.

13:15.  70,435.  I added a bit of missing description to a scene.

15:05.  71,842.  1,532 words of progress.

17:34.  72,947.  2,637 words of progress.  I swear, sometimes I start early and am unproductive, sometimes I start late and work quicker.  I can't predict it.  I got stalled for a while, and I wandered off to sit down.  I'm going to go to the store now.

22:01.  73,496.  3,186 words of progress.  Okay, I'm done for the night.  I feel like I set a relaxed pace today and had time to do other things while returning regularly to my writing.

22:02.  9.0 miles.  1,402 kcal.  29,040 steps.  5 hours, 26 minutes, and 27 seconds.  Average speed 1.6 mph.
