13:42.  Ugh.  I'm so hungry.  76 hours on my current fast.

15:22.  I feel so unwell today.  Abjectly miserable.  Can barely move around.  Just shy of 78 hours now.

15:23.  I have two goals in mind.  One is a fantasy goal, the other is realistic.  The fantasy goal is 960 hours, or 40 days.  The realistic goal is 336 hours, or 14 days.

15:24.  The 40 day fast is the 'Jesus fast' as I think of it.  I want to pull it off someday.  Keeping myself together day after day like that...  

15:33.  I can't think of anything except how tired I am.

15:37.  My secret actual target was 'until Kistaro tells me to stop'.  Kistaro told me to stop, so I stopped.

20:33.  I overate.

20:34.  54,680.

22:00.  55,033.  353 words of progress.  Oh my, this is a fight for every word.

22:12.  55,074.  394 words of progress.

23:56.  55,421.
