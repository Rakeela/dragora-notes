I ordered a case of boston cream pies yesterday.  Little hand pies, individually wrapped.  Twelve of them.  They'll arrive on Saturday.  I also ordered mint moon pies.  I wanted mint pie.  I've never had mint pie.  Can mint be made into a pie?  Moon pies aren't really pies, but I ordered some anyways.  Maybe a mint cream pie would be possible...

I've had a meal bar for breakfast, an energy drink, and a bit of soda, but my weight is currently 249.3 pounds.  That's my morning mark.

2,209 words on the file.  I'm not sure I'll actually write anything today.

91,107 words on the draft.  I'm working on Theoma material again.  Took me all day to switch tasks, grumble grumble.  91,440 words on the draft.  330 words added.  I'm supposed to be trimming it, but I found a scene that begged to be expanded.

I'll forgive myself the expansion and start trimming again from that point.  I have 10,599 words of trimming to go for my target on this second draft.

89,975 words on the draft.  1,465 words of trimming.  9,134 words to go.  That went well!

I walked 8 miles today and burned an estimated 1,302 kcal over 5 hours, 9 minutes, and 45 seconds of walking.  I was walking at a setting of 1.6 mph, though as usual the summary page says I traveled at 1.5 mph.  It's always 0.1 mph lower than the setting I used.  25,784 steps.

247.8 pounds.  I'm a bit dry right now.  I think I haven't drank enough fluid today.
