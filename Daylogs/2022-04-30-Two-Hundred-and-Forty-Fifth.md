I was doing creative writing in my head while doing dishes when there came a moment upon which the story I was writing was just, whoops!  It was suddenly gone.

If there's a Heaven, I want to have all my lost thoughts back.  I want to be able to weigh and consider thoughts like that, and to make of my stories the best they ever could have been.

In more Earthly thoughts, I want a brain implant that does this.  [[imagine-a-brain-implant]] that stores thoughts temporarily to reinforce the feedback loop of cognition so that one can actively review one's train of thought when it derails.

Would it be possible to avert some of the issues of space travel through creating a resistance exoskeleton?  It would be the opposite of a strength exoskeleton.  Instead of boosting the person's strength, it would limit their strength by fighting against them.  It'd need to be carefully tuned, but it could make all of the muscles in the body work together to make the person stand up.
