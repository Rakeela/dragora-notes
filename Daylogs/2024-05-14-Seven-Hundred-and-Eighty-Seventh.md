10:30.  40,137.

13:43.  41,144.

17:32.  41,161.  I sat at my computer for a while, then decided to go to the next town over 1) for exercise, 2) for a snack not available locally, and 3) for a break in which to think about my writing.

21:12.  42,602.  2,465 words of progress.  That's probably it for tonight.

21:20.  42,615.  2,478 words of progress.  Wasteland Engineering is going okay.  It's a big discovery writing project.  I don't quite know where I'm going.
