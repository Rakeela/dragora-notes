6:15.  So I ate some chocolate.  My forearms are asymmetrical now, with my right forearm being considerably more muscular than the left.

6:19.  New medical issues are a reminder of mortality.  While I don't want to eat more meat before I die, I do want to eat more chocolate.  Sort of.  One of the two chocolate bars I'd been fantasizing about was disappointing, and I don't think I'll eat much of it.

6:20.  My left jaw has begun hurting significantly.  This feels like divine punishment for eating sweets, but it's almost certainly not.

6:36.  Kistaro said "exercise the left side of your body more, and we'll see if this gets better," (paraphrased), but everything I can find online says that contacting a doctor is appropriate when there's an observable asymmetry in strength between the two sides of the body.
