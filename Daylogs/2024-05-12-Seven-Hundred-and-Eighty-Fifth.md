10:51.  I have been forgetting to publish my third novel.  In general, I don't think I'm on track to publish four novels this year.

18:37.  34,129.

20:21.  36,099.  1,970 words of progress.  It's amazing.  At first, I stared helplessly at the blank page, not knowing what to write next.  Then, I had an idea, and I unfurled it for nearly two thousand words without stopping.

20:22.  That was better productivity than I expected to have today given my late start.  I'm at another point where I don't know what to write next.  That's why I came here to report on my productivity thus far - because I'd hit a stumbling block.
