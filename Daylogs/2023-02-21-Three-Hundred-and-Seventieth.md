Morning weigh-in:  246.1 pounds.

I'm starting off today with an ice cream sandwich, 290 calories, 37 grams carbohydrates.  It's under 400 calories, though definitely not keto.  Calories-in/calories-out is bogus, so my 400 calorie target works best when it's 400 calories of protein and fat.  This ice cream sandwich will cause an insulin rise, temporarily stopping the depletion of stored fat reserves.

I've been tracking my weight for the hours since I ate that ice cream sandwich.  Normally there's a smooth declinining tendency, with bumps up when I drink something and bumps down when I use the restroom.  Today, my weight went up a bit and stalled.  I think that's due to the insulin spike... but I may be overreading sparse data.

I'm only walking for an hour today.  4,619 steps, crossing 1.3 miles, burning an estimated 233 kcal, and walking for 1 hour, 1 minute, and 22 seconds.  Estimated speed, 1.3 mph.  I'm restricting myself to this much in order to give my foot fissures more of a chance to heal.

Evening weigh-in:  246.1 pounds.  Behold the power of a single ice cream sandwich in the morning.  Could also be the peanuts I've had across the course of the day.  Or the small amount of cheese.  Cheese won't make me fatter, but it does have to physically traverse my gut.  Plus a large amount of liquids that I consumed today.
