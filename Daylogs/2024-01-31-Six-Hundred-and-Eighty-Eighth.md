9:43.  Done with Nationstates stuff, time to get started on Slantworld.  27,042.  That's odd.  The file contained one more word than this when I left off yesterday, didn't it?

10:14.  27,308.

14:01.  30,976.  3,668 words of progress.

20:48.  After my last timepoint, my focus totally fell apart and never recovered all day long.  I've been miserable since that point and wholly unproductive in my art.

22:43.  31,356.  4,048 words of progress.  I'm going to call this done for the night.
