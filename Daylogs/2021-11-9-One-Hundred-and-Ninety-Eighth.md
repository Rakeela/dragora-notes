I've thought of a weird and interesting idea for [[imagine-a-brain-implant]].  What if people had a virtual space in their head for headmates - very coherent, sane ones, much better than the ones that my recent illness has foisted off onto me - who would do virtual work?  A lot of the 'overhead' work in advanced societies is work that has to be done somewhere.  What if overhead was managed overhead, in virtual cubicle farms?  It could be a distributed network, or just internet-enabled... if people trusted each other enough to jack in to a network like that!

I'm not sure if I like the idea enough to put it in the imagine-a-file, but I wanted to get it written down when it occurred to me.
