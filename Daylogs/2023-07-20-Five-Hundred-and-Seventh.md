6:46.  I tried setting my alarm all the way back to 5:30.  At 6:30, I awoke to discover the alarm was not going off.  A few minutes later, I discovered that it had been snoozed for an hour, without my conscious awareness.

8:25.  I finished morning stuff, and I am at loose ends.  I have been drifting along *wishing* to engage with meaningful tasks.  Argh.  I have to make my own meaningful tasks.

8:34.  I should read Pridelord.

11:58.  Well, I've been reading Pridelord.  I've been afflicted with an unpleasant sensation.  "Reading is so slow," I've found myself thinking.  I've previously thought this about strategy games, and I stopped playing strategy games as a result.  Am I now being tempted to stop reading?  Can I still read despite it being 'so slow'?

18:02.  It's 18:02 and I haven't done any work on my editing.  Today sucked.  I got beat down by symptoms of...  I guess misery.  Psychological disarray.  If real life were a game of Cultist Simulator, it might even qualify as 'Fascination'.  And...  I dealt with it!  Introspectively.  I exerted introspective self-control to address and reduce symptoms.  Except to an external perspective, what I was doing was wasting the day, and even taking a nap in the middle of it.  Reading Pridelord was the most productive thing I did.

18:03.  However!  I've loaded up my editing task now.

(This bit added the next day.)  I walked over six hours, but when I woke up the next morning, the display was blanked.  That prevents me from adding the tally the next day.
