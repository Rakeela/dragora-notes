I had an odd thought.  If extremely good vaccines were produced for the vast majority of pathogens, would society get filthier as a result?  Would people become more filth-tolerant, generally?

I don't think so.  I think cleanliness would still retain *aesthetic* power indefinitely... even if dirtiness lost its moral imperative from causing illness.  Yet I'm not sure.  Some amount of increasing filth-tolerance is actually virtuous, as when people decide that the wrong things are 'filthy', or when people refuse to do things that they would otherwise enjoy due to pathogenic hazards that they also would rather ameliorate.

I thought about this because I read an article which I've just dropped into my [[medical-news-archive]].  It's about filth in drinking water.  This is the second time I've contemplated this article.  When I *first* read this article, I thought about how we should consider setting up automated cleaning systems rather than dumping another unpleasant task on people who probably already have other work to do.  Automated systems to clean the tanks could also help *of themselves* to keep wildlife off.

I imagined this design:  A two-tank structure where the lower tank is a sedimentation tank and the higher tank has a slow, automated sweeping arm at the bottom of it.  The sweeping arm is a great semicircle that sweeps sediment from the higher tank into the lower tank.  When the circular motion of the sweeping arm takes it sweeping outside of the radius of the two tanks, it sweeps through a waterproof fabric extension that extends and retracts to accommodate it.  This slowly spreading-and-retracting fabric extension would tend to scare off birds and raccoons while providing a point of visual interest to the local city skyline.  I'm not sure if this design is or is not practical, but I wanted to share it.  Someone else can likely do better at coming up with an automated sediment-remover for water towers.

When I contemplated the article again today, I thought about the vaccine point that I opened this daylog with.  What if we used RNA vaccination to extinguish all of those infectious diseases?  Would people care about filth in the tanks?  Well...  Kind of yes, kind of no.  I think that tap water would stay visually clean and clean enough to taste good, because those are aesthetic concerns which people don't need pathogen-sensitivity to care about.  Yet it would take longer to act on cleanliness issues were there no public health issue... so the average visual clarity and cleanliness might drop even though people still care.

If we set up automated systems to clean the water towers and make them a standard component of water tower design, the bureaucracy won't have to get involved, and factors which increase bureaucratic intransigence can be mitigated in advance.  Currently, that would help with extinguishing infectious disease.  In the future, that would help safeguard quality of life against a factor which the extinction of infectious disease might threaten.

It's strange to think that humanity owes anything in its quality of life to the threat of infectious disease, but it's true.  We don't solely like hygiene for its antipathogenicity, but also because it makes life better.  It's a good idea to act in advance to protect aesthetic hygiene from things that will lose force as medical technology advances... and it would itself be a form of medical progress.

I still do think prostitution should be legal, but like... classy prostitution.  Clean, safe, and well-regulated.  It should be part of a charismatic sexuality free of misinformation.
