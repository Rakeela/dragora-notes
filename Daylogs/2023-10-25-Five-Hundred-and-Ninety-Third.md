10:15.  I got up a little earlier this time.  Yesterday's treadmill use:  4.0 miles.  726 kcal.  15,264 steps.  3 hours, 16 minutes, 13 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.

(This part added the next day.)  10.3 miles.  1,780 kcal.  37,139 steps.  7 hours, 47 minutes, 39 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  Also, wow, did I really make no more entries yesterday?  Because yesterday was pretty cool.  I spent *the whole day* talking to people online, and I got some key editing done on The Tachanigh-Kelkaith, and I continued to study Hc Svnt Dracones.
