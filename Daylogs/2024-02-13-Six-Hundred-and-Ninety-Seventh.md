5:27.  I got up a little less than an hour and a half ago.  I couldn't sleep anymore.

5:31.  I feel so broken.  There's nothing I can or want to do.  Except brush my teeth, something I forgot to do before bed.

5:36.  Teeth brushed.  Now there's nothing I can or want to do.

10:00.  I went back to bed.  Now I've been up for a little while, and I've just talked to people a bit.

10:43.  I finally want to play Nationstates.

12:19.  Done with Nationstates for now.  It was actually progress to want to play it.  It was wanting *something*.  Leisure activities are so utterly de-energizing.  I swear playing games just makes me want to do nothing at all, and it sucks.

12:20.  You know what makes me happy and productive?  Psych pills.

12:22.  Now that my desire to do stuff is back, I immediately want to try finishing that Dawnfeather Gloria run.  Just two in-game years left.

12:34.  I didn't load up the game, but I did spend a few minutes reading the game's wiki.  I need to work on Slantworld.

12:36.  It's weird that leisure activities demoralize me.  Aren't they supposed to make people happy?

12:38.  43,543.  I'm stuck, so I need to find a way to tap randomness for inspiration.

13:01.  43,874.  I need to take a walk for inspiration.

13:12.  44,015.  I kept working instead of taking that walk, but I still feel like I need to do it.

15:17.  I took that walk and then read for a while after getting back.  I'm well into my reread of Ashen Weald.  It's a rare example of a war story that I like.

16:07.  Wow, I'm so distracted.  I'm still thinking about Equestria at War.

16:52.  44,440.  Progress is slow.  Why do I wake up every day depressed, and only slowly regain the ability to function?  What's so bad about my sleep that sleeping seems to leave me waking in a dysfunctional state every time?

18:58.  45,780.  2,237 words of progress.  I feel kinda bad about my writing.  It has touched one of the themes of Ord: that there's bigotry in the setting.  By Theoma, bigotry has been ironed out.
