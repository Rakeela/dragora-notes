10:57.  I got up before 7:10, and...  I don't know.  I haven't read books, I haven't played videogames, and I haven't written.  I've been reading Discord and I've been reading news.  I caught up on Nationstates.

11:01.  51,573.

14:19.  Wow, did I think I'd get to work earlier?  I got nothing.  I'm at a very difficult point in the journey where it feels like anything could happen, and when anything can happen, nothing can happen.  It's a massive question mark.  I pushed back the question mark as much as I could, but I can't delay it anymore.  It needs to happen.

14:22.  51,559.

17:10.  52,325.  752 words of progress.

17:22.  I've continued experimenting with my eating habits.  I ate a donut today, as well as four sugarfree candies, but otherwise all I've eaten is a pack of lentils.  I parceled out the pack into eight roughly equal servings, and I ate one every time I wanted a snack.  I think tomorrow I'm likely to eat about the same amount.

18:11.  Wait, did I eat a really good pasta dish this morning?  It was a vegan veggie lo mein.

18:21.  It's honestly hard for me to track everything I eat in any given day.

18:29.  Food doesn't create memory the way other things do.

18:32.  I ate another sugar-free candy, just to reflect on it.  Why can't I remember my meals?  Why do I have so much trouble with this?  It goes with the way I hide my meals.  It's like I hide my eating even from myself.

18:36.  Journaling everything I eat has been suggested to me before.

18:40.  I'm really proud of the lentil thing.  That was a good idea and it worked.  I got to snack pretty much as often as I wanted without guilt today.

18:41.  I'm less proud of the donut, and I'm actively bothered by the veggie lo mein.  It was *freaking delicious*, so why was it the least memorable meal?  I reflected on the deliciousness of the vegetables as I ate it.

18:44.  Pasta just means 'noodles', right?  Same thing?

19:23.  I'm being distracted by thoughts of food again.  There's nothing left that I should eat tonight.  There are things I can eat tomorrow.

19:24.  Oh, but 52,754.  I have been making a little more progress writing.

19:53.  53,062.  I've been having psychotic symptoms.  They seem to rise in the evening, and go away when I take my antipsychotics.  It's as though a critical effect wears off in the evening.

21:21.  I'm going to eat another sugarfree candy.

21:47.  54,319.  2,760 words of progress.

21:55.  I'm done for tonight.  It's about bedtime.
