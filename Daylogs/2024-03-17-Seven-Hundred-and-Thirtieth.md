10:53.  Sleep sucked last night.

11:24.  Time is passing me by.

11:39.  45,460.  45,465.

13:07.  46,304.

13:36.  46,373.  I'm considerably happier than I used to be, even though I am still sometimes acquainted with misery.  I'm happier as an asexual than I ever was as a sexual being.

14:38.  47,176.  1,716 words of progress.

15:09.  47,622.  2,162 words of progress.  I feel foggy and tired.  Mentally fatigued.  I want to take a break, but nothing tends to make me feel better from a state like this.

17:22.  47,807.  Whaaaat.  It's been this long with so little progress?  I'm taking a break to play Nationstates.  I'm not getting anything done in my writing anyways.

22:47.  47,912.  After playing Nationstates for a while, I came back and tried to write, but I didn't get very far.  Eventually, I went out to Molly Moons with Kistaro, then we played Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor together.  I don't play that game alone.  After that we showered.  Now I'm coming back to record my current time point.
