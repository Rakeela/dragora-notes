My new shoes rub.  I have a blister on my foot.  Another injury.

4.9 miles, 624 kcal, 11,866 steps.  1 hour, 40 minutes, and 31 seconds.  Average speed 3.0 mph.

I can go fast enough, but I can't go far enough.  I was exhausted all day.  I didn't get far on my treadmill.  I was also working on programming.  I have a project coded in Go.  I found it difficult to think and walk at the same time.  Maybe I should set the speed down to something I can multitask with more effectively.  I had 2,500 kcal one day, didn't I?  I'm too tired to browse my notes right now to check that, but maybe I should imitate that day on future days.
