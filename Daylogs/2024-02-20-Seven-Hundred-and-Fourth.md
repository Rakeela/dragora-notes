5:58.  I just finished a chocolate bar.

6:47.  Ate a homemade dill salad.

8:36.  It's weird, I'm definitely not hungry.  In fact, I kinda feel overfull.  It should be a very satisfying, good way to feel, but gluttony is tweaking at me, saying, "Go eat something!"

8:37.  That salad I ate earlier was quite good and much more filling than the chocolate bar...  Dill salad is my favorite food.

8:38.  My own version isn't as good as the dill salad packs from Trader Joe's, but those are season, and no longer on the shelf.  

9:21.  Still not really actually hungry.  I haven't been thinking about hunger since my last timepoint, I've been posting to /pol/.  I came up with some good points.  I'm not one of the bigoted posters, I'm antifascist.  I try to encourage the posters there to be more beneficial to the world.  It's practice for my own serenity as well.

9:35.  Ugh.  Unpleasant flavor in my mouth.  Aluminum?  Does aluminum have a flavor?  Why do I associate this flavor with aluminum?  It's a metallic flavor at least.

10:19.  Eating a sugarfree cookie.  It's small!

10:50.  I am very sore considering I stayed off the treadmill yesterday.  My back and my hips both ache.  I took naproxen, that will probably help.

11:34.  I ate three small full-sugar cookies.  They weren't very good; I threw out the rest of the pack.  I wonder why I tasted aluminum earlier.  I'd been drinking an energy drink at the time.

12:49.  I'm being distracted by thoughts of food again.  Let's see...  Chocolate bar, dill salad, sugarfree cookie, three cookies.  That's what I've eaten today.  That's plenty.

13:33.  I've barely thought about work all day.  Being on my ass is a disaster.  *checks log*  I said the same thing yesterday, and it still applies.  I wish I could walk hard every day.  At the same time, my poor feet.  I'm feeling better for taking a rest.

13:34.  Better, although I'm still hungry.  I keep being tempted to eat another chocolate bar.  A whole chocolate bar!  My temptations regard that as a reasonable snack.  I do not agree with them, however many times I've done it.

13:34.  Time to chop up another package of lentils and stop feeling so bad about snacking.  I'll just eat lentils.  I should've chopped it up earlier.  It would've been healthier to eat a bit of lentil rather than those three cookies.

14:21.  I've been reading a new book.  Legends of Heraldale.

15:06.  I should be writing.  Damn, I feel slack.  It's not a well-rested feeling.  I feel like my metabolism is letting me down.  Like I slowed down, but my metabolism slowed down *more*.

15:07.  I'm getting back on the treadmill starting tomorrow.

15:09.  I feel tense, tired, and unhappy.  Am I investing in the future?  I'm just thinking about food today.  Not in my usual sense.  I'm at a high state of consciousness around this food issue.

15:14.  I mean, I'm being mindful about food, but I'm not even fasting.

15:36.  I am suffering intrusive thoughts that say, "Screw temperance, eat a pound of your reserve chocolate!"  This really sucks.

16:56.  I didn't end up eating any of my reserve chocolate.  I'm done for today as far as food is concerned.

16:58.  Maybe I'll eat some of my reserve chocolate tomorrow.  It would be good practice if I could eat a small portion and keep to that.

16:59.  I took someone else's scenario, tweaked it until the AI was likely to output porn, and clicked 'continue' for a while until I cut it off because I deemed the likelihood of it doing so very high.  I did that earlier to try to shake off the intrusive thoughts about chocolate.  It kinda worked?  Asexuality sucks, though.

17:00.  I mean, the plumbing works, I can masturbate.  It's just not great.

17:02.  I can't buy in to scenarios about people being horny for each other.

17:06.  I used to have this urge to study sexuality.  I felt so alienated over my lack of interest in people.  I wanted desperately to figure out what makes people interested in sexuality.  This was juiced by past life recall of draconic sexuality.  But draconic sexuality was crass, easy, and mostly irrelevant; human sexuality only ticks one of those boxes, and sometimes not even that one.

17:10.  56,218.  I'm not sure I'll write much today, but I thought of something I want to write, so I'll write a little bit.

17:18.  56,261.  That's the bit I had in mind.

17:41.  I've got two books open that I've been reading.  Focus is scarce, even though it's the only meaningful thing I've been doing today.

17:45.  What, that was only four minutes?  That felt like twenty.  Normally, I appreciate when time extends, but I was just thinking that I feel quite stressed.

17:59.  If I'm going to be this stressed on a day off, I'm going to eat.

18:16.  It isn't right that I feel stressed when I don't work.  I feel like someone is hurting me on purpose to punish me for not working hard enough in their opinion.  I feel like I got targeted by a slaver-hacker defending the right of all power to trump freedom and justice.

18:18.  Back when I was fasting more regularly, I felt attacked in a similar way on 'unproductive' days in which I was successfully fasting, and I was blocked from making long-term investments in my health via fasting.

18:20.  In order to control my diet, I need to be able to control my diet *at ease.*

18:22.  Oh, but I ate a chocolate orange.

18:31.  Also a handful of dill potato chips.

22:54.  I ate 5 espresso cookies and now I'm eating a dark chocolate orange.  57,432.  1,214 words of progress.

22:57.  I've recorded everything I've eaten today, but I also binged.  Can I do this and actually eat lightly, as I was supposed to?

23:24.  57,547.  1,329 words of progress.  I'm not sure I can write more right now, but I feel like I wrote some important stuff.

23:35.  I'm on season 4, episode 10 of She-Ra.  This show is almost too good to multitask my writing with.  It distracts me, clearing my mind of other thoughts... and it's too effective.  It clears away stuff that I'm using, too.  Multitasking with writing has been awesome, though.  It feels good.  I just need media of a mid-grade quality.  Good enough and not too good.  She-Ra is too good to be ideal, but I made it work this evening.  There's a bunch of stuff that I've found which works.  Thanks to Akity!

23:44.  I'm eating some cauliflower mac.  Tomorrow I'll record everything I eat again, and I'll eat less!  Also, I'll use the treadmill again.  My feet feel great from all the rest.

23:47.  My highly erratic eating habits might really disturb watchers who seek regularity, but people don't have the right to enforce regularity upon each other.  Liberty and justice are the watchwords of society.  Liberty is often highly irregular.  Justice is not, but if it tromps on liberty, it is false.
