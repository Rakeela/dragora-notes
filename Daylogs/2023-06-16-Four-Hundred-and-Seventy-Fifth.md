11:37.  It's been three hours since I got up, but I haven't been able to do much.  I'm so exhausted today.  I was cold when I got up.  I eventually recovered (without eating), but I have no energy.  I just want to sleep.

11:40.  Or eat.  I also want to eat.  81 hours left before I can eat again.

11:59.  Kistaro talked me into eating a small amount today for the sake of my productivity.  I've eaten one cookie.  I'm also heating the oven to eat a single serving spinach and mushroom pizza.  Even just with the one cookie, I feel immediately like I can get to work.  Let's see...  Taltios' Travelogue needs more investment in set-up of the decision to go to Ormeri.

12:15.  I ate another cookie.  It felt very good, almost as good as the first.  I bet a third wouldn't.

12:19.  I'm eating a third cookie!  Mm.  It's not nearly as good as the second one was, but it's still good.  I'm calling off my fast; I'll resume again when I've eaten that single serving pizza.

12:22.  I started working again at the 11:59 mark.  I'm starting another draft for Taltios' Travelogue, so even though I'm still working over the opening, I'm already on Draft 3.  The problem is that it's not just editorial tweaking, I'm changing the events.  I want to preserve what I already had, so I have to kick over and start a new draft.  1,600 words on the new file... to begin with.

12:38.  The pizza was pretty delicious.

13:57.  2,569 words on the file.  969 words of progress.  Progress definitely comes more slowly on Theoma.

14:24.  I thought Ritter Sport Marzipan was good, but I just tried it head-to-head with another marzipan variety.  It's not as good!  Also, oh god.  I'm eating too much.  I'm just eating freely.  It's so hard to stop.

14:26.  I can't stop.  I'm eating a bit more.  My instincts are telling me to feed before I starve.  They're right, but this is so maladaptive.  I need to lose more weight!

15:56.  3,293.  1,693 words of progress.

16:11.  Theoma tempts me way more than Kura and Kaire to write to quota.

19:12.  Playing strategy games takes way too long.  I finished my first map of Age of Wonders 4.  I won't start another one until the Dragon expansion pack releases on the 20th.  I may not jump to it immediately.  Strategy games are pretty low-yield as ways to spend time are concerned.  I'm considering picking up Night in the Woods instead, but I'm not sure.  I'm worried it'll just depress me.

21:22.  3,638.  2,038 words of progress.  Not quite as 'just to quota' as 1,700.
