Mung gels: probably beyond my skill.  The finely ground mung bean is not a soluble ingredient.  It did not suspend in water.  Every transfer step bled mung bean.  The result looks terrible and I'm scared to taste it.

On the plus side, monksfruit powder looks very promising.  It's water-soluble and it tastes like sugar.

Making mung gel candies would require more molecular gastronomy skill than I have.  I'd need to find a way to suspend the vegetable matter more effectively.  Had I the skill to make it correctly, it might still be a bad idea.

Conservativism strengthens in opacity.  Liberalism strengthens in transparency.  Conservatives understand this, and so try to threaten liberals into opacity by threatening to victimize liberals who are transparent.  Liberals misunderstand this, and so submit to conservatives by becoming opaque and dying out.

In some eras, liberals also understand this, and so embrace transparency, thus strengthening as conservatives pressed to become less hypocritical refuse or fail in transparent conditions.
