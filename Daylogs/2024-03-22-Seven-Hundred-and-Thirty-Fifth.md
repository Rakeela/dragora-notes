17:52.  Ugh.  I don't feel like planning out a war.  3,691 words of progress.

21:36.  65,552.  I mostly played with my TTRPG group since my last timepoint.  I have a distinct 'most unreasonable player' and he's frustrating to deal with.  Anyway, I'm in no mind to write further right now.  3,761 words of progress.
