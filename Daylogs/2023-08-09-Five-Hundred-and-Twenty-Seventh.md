8:23.  I've been up since 5:33, but I feel I can account for the time better this morning than I can some mornings.  Not only have I done all the morning stuff, I played Cultist Simulator for a time.  It's not like some mornings, where three hours pass in the morning, leaving me confused as to what happened.

8:24.  The voices in my head take an interest in my writing sometimes.  Presently, they've criticized one of my characters as coming off more as a serial killer than as a warrior.  They want me to rewrite the scene.  I don't know how to clarify the difference between the two.

9:52.  Blah.  I'm still demoralized.

9:59.  15,140.  Despite morale issues, I do still have a book to write.

11:17.  16,110.  3,301 words on the chapter.

11:49.  16,474.  1,334 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  I guess that means I'd better start the next chapter.

13:38.  17,841.  2,701 words of progress.  1,365 words on the chapter.

17:22.  18,945.  2,479 words on the chapter.  3,805 words of progress.

17:46.  19,053.  3,913 words of progress.  2,587 words on the chapter.

18:09.  19,234.  Chapter complete.  4,094 words of progress.

18:14.  I want to stop writing for the night, but I'm not sure what else to do.
