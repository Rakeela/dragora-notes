10:19.  I feel grumpy and I don't want to work on Wasteland Engineering yet.  I haven't been able to work my mind into a useful state.

10:20.  If someone's day job is the investigation of sex crimes, does that make them a fucking detective?

11:26.  I'm going to go buy something sweet from the store.  It might make me feel more alert.  I mean, creative.  It might make me feel more creative.  I'm plenty alert.

11:57.  I ate a box of cookies.  Yum!  I thought about Wasteland Engineering while I was doing it.  Now I'm ready to continue.  135,305.

13:31.  I've been distracted and unproductive.

13:58.  My focus has been hopelessly impeded... by playing a porn game.  Text-based and furry, obviously.  Well, scalie.  All the characters are dragons.

13:59.  As usual for me, it's pretty much fictional heterosexuality.  The things I go for in fiction have no overlap with the things I go for IRL.

14:01.  Okay, I think I'm finally ready to work.

16:59.  I've gotten absorbed in some optional content that a lot of players won't explore on a first pass.  They're warned not to do it.  The warning is a little vapid, I'm not planning to punish them for going here.

18:55.  140,184.

19:26.  Haven't written more.  Calculating the word count.  4,879 words of progress.

21:48.  Oh, god.  I've been working on a scene that is really slowing me up.  I think I'll make good progress tomorrow.  I'm within days of finishing this project's first draft.  140,501 words.  Soon I'll have to actually test it.

21:51.  5,196 words of progress.
