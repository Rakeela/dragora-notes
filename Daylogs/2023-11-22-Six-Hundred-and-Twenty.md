20:37.  Meratep.  I've found a name for my kalla in my next Theoma book.  Kistaro suggested it.  I think I'll run with it.

21:39.  Some candy just burns.  It's... weird.  It's just a burning flavor.  It's not good.  It's sweet, but it's dissatisfying.

21:41.  Did the burning candies always taste that way?  It's a mystery to me.  They're bad now.  I can absolutely devour burning candies, they're as easy to eat as air, but they're about as satisfying as air.  Mounds is a burning candy.  I just devoured five snack-sized Mounds, and it was...  like I'd eaten nothing at all.  Except I know I definitely did eat something, and that the full repercussions of that consumption will be on my biology.  Maybe I'll never eat a Mounds again.  I'm throwing out some candy corn.  I already know it'll be a burning candy.

21:45.  Rarer than burning candies, some candies taste like sand.  I can't devour them like I can devour burning candies, but somehow I like them more.  It tastes interesting.  It's still a sweet flavor.  It's not VERY good though, and I feel like I should only eat sweets that are VERY good.  I also wonder, did they always taste like sand?

21:48.  I'm eating sweets and destroying them.  I'm ravaging my candy vault.  I'm eating a piece and throwing out the bag.

21:49.  It's already unfit for consumption.  It was wasted when it was made.  Human misery went into every bite.  Suffering and labor.  Wasted.  It could've served a better purpose.  It's barely a hedonic gain for me.  It's a hedonic loss for its manufacturers.  Wasted effort, wasted materials, wasted equipment, wasted food, wasted land.

21:55.  So much disappointment.
