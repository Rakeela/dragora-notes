10:36.  I've been doing a bit of writing.  97,128.  97,162.  That said, I need to go to a dentist appointment imminently.

16:12.  97,521.  Is that all I've managed to get done?  What is wrong with me today?  The dentist appointment didn't take that much time out of my day.

16:26.  97,693.  I'm reworking the flow of a scene, and it's slow going.

17:20.  98,083.

17:23.  98,124.

19:36.  98,472.  My productivity has been dire lately.  I mean, 1,344 words?

20:59.  98,890.  1,762 words of progress.

21:02.  Man.  I tried.
