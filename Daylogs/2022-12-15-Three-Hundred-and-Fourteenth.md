87 hours.  I'm cold and tired today.  This feeling makes the fast feel more impossible than mere hunger.

Okay, I watched a "Zero Punctuation" video essay about tonal discontinuities in games, and seeing Yahtzee curse about games being ridiculous really helped me feel better.  I'm more energized now, relatively speaking.  I still feel sucky.  A little more than three and a half days into my fast...  This time, I'll be tracking how much time passes to when I feel different ways.

88 hours.  In addition to the pumpkin biscuits, I also bought two kinds of premade cookie dough.  I haver "peppermint cocoa" cookie dough which is chocolate cookie dough with peppermint chunks in it, and I have "pumpkin" cookie which is a pumpkin cinnamon cookie with cream cheese chunks in it.  I intend to eat some of each raw and cook the rest.  I probably won't eat them on Christmas day.  The pumpkin cookie dough says it can be eaten raw.  The peppermint cocoa cookie dough says to not do that.  I'm going to take the risk and eat some of both!

90 hours.  I have in my stash "Jingle Jangle Pretzel Twists".  They're large pretzel twists covered in a peanut butter candy shell, with pieces of chocolate and chocolate cookie adhered to them.  I'm not a big fan of hard pretzels, so I'm hoping they're soft pretzels.  Big soft pretzels.  Alas, I opened the pack to look at them, and they don't have any give when prodded.  I'll find out for sure when I bite into one after this fast.

91.5 hours.  I haven't been very productive in editing, and I haven't done any writing at all.  I'm so tired today.

95 hours.  I have two kinds of marzipan in my stash, and I'm looking forward to eating them when I finish my fast.  I have a Ritter Sport dark chocolate marzipan bar.  I've had this before.  It's delicious.  I also have Niederegger milk chocolate marzipan bar.  I haven't had this before.  I fully expect it'll be delicious.  The image makes it look like it amazing, thick-filled with marzipan paste.  It's less sweet than the Ritter Sport bar, with more fat and protein in it, so I'm curious how the texture will diverge.  The Niederegger bar also lists "artificial rose water flavor" in its ingredients list.  I'm so curious if I'll be able to taste that.  I plan to eat these two items together, not mixed up, but alternating bites.

These marzipan bars are both so heavy that I absolutely shouldn't eat them all in one sitting.  I have a history of going through Ritter Sport bars in one sitting, but when I have two marzipan bars and a whole bag of other candies?  I think *these* marzipan bars will survive my first encounter with them.

I plan to buy a little more marzipan before Christmas day, but not yet.  Perhaps on the 22nd when I go out to buy some cakes that I have my eye on.  They'd get stale before the end of my fast if I bought them now.  Would a marzipan loaf?  How imperishable is marzipan?  I don't know, so I'm delaying on it, but I'm pretty sure the Ritter Sport and Niederegger bars will keep just fine.  Their use-by dates are halfway through next year.

I'm so tempted to nibble on my candy.  I eat a little bit of low-calorie materials as it is, and it would be no different, right?  Wrong.  It'd be sweet.  Sweetness I fear would interrupt ketosis, throwing my metabolism into sickness and ineffectuality.
