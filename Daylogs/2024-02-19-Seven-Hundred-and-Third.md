9:30.  I'm starting my day with two sugarfree candies.

11:35.  I spent a while reading a political discussion on a server where I read *everything*, but which usually isn't very active.  Not sure that was rewarding.

13:50.  I ate an overpriced slice of cake and another two sugarfree candies.  Now I'm going to go slice up another package of lentils.

15:17.  My feet felt inflamed this morning as I lay in bed, not yet having gotten up, so I decided to take a break from my treadmill.  However, I have been completely unfocused all day long, and the whole day is just slipping right past.  If I'm not in motion, time doesn't flow right.  Sitting on my ass is a disaster.

15:49.  I have moved to at least stand, and I am working on Slantworld now.  54,319.  54,377.

15:51.  I have also eaten an espresso cup full of ice cream.  I have decided that espresso cups are the perfect serving size of ice cream.  Enough to savor the flavor.  The serving sizes at Coldstone Creamery are atrocious!  Much too large!

17:48.  I have continued to be critically distracted.  54,377.  Standing didn't really help.  I need my treadmill.   A day off my treadmill is tantamount to a day off of writing.  My feet do at least feel less inflamed...

19:03.  I'm eating a mint.  55,122.  803 words of progress.

19:11.  55,146.  1,007 words of progress.

19:17.  I want marshmallow.

19:26.  I'm eating a sugarfree candy.  That's my fifth one today.  No undocumented snacking!

19:29.  Hunger pangs!  I want more food.

20:04.  Still distracted by thoughts of food.  55,583.  1,444 words of progress.

21:16.  56,091.  1,772 words of progress.

21:25.  56,218.  1,899 words of progress.

22:07.  I got distracted watching something.

22:36.  One more sugarfree candy.

22:46.  One more.  No more, two more.

22:47.  A third more!

22:49.  I'm just going to finish off one kind of these.  Another whole four more.

22:53.  To clarify, that's 2 this morning, 2 this afternoon, and 9 this evening.  Very unwise.

23:07.  I feel fine for the moment, but my gut is going to fall apart tonight.
