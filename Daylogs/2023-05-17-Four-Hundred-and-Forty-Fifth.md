10:53.  I've eaten 5 cookies and a bowl of "General Tso's Tofu" today.  Three of the cookies were kinda bad.  Two of them were delicious.  The bowl of General Tso's Tofu was good, but not as good as its packaging made it look.  Frozen foods never look as good as their packaging.

11:01.  All I can think about this morning is food.  I mean, my Kingdom game has advanced a little bit, and I read an article about how we're closer to AGI than researchers thought, but none of that is substantive.  I should be thinking about my writing.  Ugh, though.  Honestly I feel like I've already overeaten.  The cookies weren't gigantic, they were actually on the small side.  Even so.  I'm not used to eating that much.

11:04.  I want to bike across town to the Whole Foods and pick up another "Whole Foods Assortment" for my [[Candy-Vault]].  It's such an unproductive urge.  I also kinda want to get some more "Decadent Red Velvet Chocolate Chunk" cookies.  Those are the best cookies so far.

11:16.  I put the article about AI into [[Science-News-Archive]].  There's a card I haven't drawn for a while...  I'm kinda miserable.  I can't work right now.  I can't even read.  Thinking about reading though, I bought a book on Manichaeism yesterday.  The impression I've gotten about Manichaeism is that it was a syncretistic psuedo-Christian religion.  I bought a book which seems to argue that Manichaeism should rise again as a new Christian doctrine.  I hope it'll be inspirational in a mythic sense.

11:23.  I don't want to read The Wearle, either.  This book seems kinda bad.  I got 16 pages in and I disliked it.  Now I'm 26 pages in and I still dislike it.

11:34.  35 pages.  It's still terrible.

11:44.  Someone on my dragon book club server has pointed out the dearth of hydra POV books. 

11:57.  49 pages.  Still terrible.

12:05.  My current pants have a rip in the crotch, and I think they're a size too large.  I think I'll go across town to the Fred Meyer and see if I can get a replacement.  It'll be interesting to try on 40x30s.

13:33.  New pants acquired.  A pair of pants and a pair of "shorts" that are very long.  Both in 40x30, which turns out to fit comfortably now.

13:36.  I have decided I am going to deplete the entire dark chocolate collection that I bought!  Muahahaha!

13:37.  The chili chocolate was good, but not stellar.  Mm, though!  This salted caramel is amazing.  What a soft, luscious caramel!

13:39.  The cocoa dusted truffle doesn't stand out.  It's just chocolate.  The salt truffle on the other hand...  It's something I haven't had before.  Hard to describe.  Hmm...  I'm no gourmand.  These chocolates are wasted on me.

13:42.  The whole interior of the coffee truffle came out in my teeth.  The exterior was quite hard.  Not a great experience texturally.  Flavor was, obviously, coffee.

13:44.  I bit into what I thought would be the double chocolate, but it turned out to be the hazelnut caramel.  My only complaint is that it's not as good as the salted caramel.  I went after the double chocolate next, and mm!  It's fruity.  I mean, obviously it's chocolate, but there's definitely a fruitiness to it that I didn't see coming.  Delicious.

13:46.  The 70% truffle had no standout marks.  Maybe a bit earthy, though obviously very sweet.

13:47.  I've got what looks like two coconut caramel and almond crocant items here.  Biting into one... yup, it's what I expected.  Sort of.  What a strong flavor!  There's so much coconut, caramel, and almond here that I'm hardly tasting chocolate.

13:48.  The other turned out to be more of the same.

13:49.  I've got a green tea chocolate, a spiced chai chocolate, and a mango & lemongrass chocolate.  It's hard to choose which one to finish on.  I don't think I want to finish on green tea, so I'll eat that one next...  Mm!  Maybe this is a wonderful finisher to the box and I should set it aside.  There's a fruitiness here too, but it's definitely green tea.  I'll set aside half.

13:50.  I was expecting more from the spiced chai chocolate.  I'm glad I didn't leave it for last.

13.52.  Mango & lemongrass is such an unconventional flavor.  I bit off half of it, and now I have to decide whether to finish with the M&L or with the green tea.  I think I love the mango & lemongrass chocolate best.  I'm just sitting here breathing it in, letting it linger in my mouth.  The chocolate is a bit lost in this.  It's just an opening salvo, and then it's all the fruit.

13:54.  I ate the other half of the green tea chocolate, and it doesn't compare.  So I nibbled a bit more of the mango & lemongrass chocolate.  I want more of these.  Not right now; I've definitely had enough chocolate right now!  But in the future.  I would buy a box of just these.  I wouldn't buy the rest of the box... except maybe the salted caramel.

13:57.  Well, that was an experience.  It'll be years before I buy another chocolates box.  They're not good enough to justify their purchase price, or I'm not enough of a gourmand to appreciate them.  I did appreciate the fruity dark chocolate, though.  That was a surprise.

14:14.  I haven't done any writing or editing today.  There's no way I'm going to remove 500 words from the material.  I'm only starting... now.  91,592 words on the file.

14:20.  91,594.  -2 words removed.  I rewrote something.  Subtract a few words, add a few words, end up with a longer description this time.  I think it's improved, which is the important part.

14:23.  91,571.  21 words removed.  Progress.

14:27.  91,512.  80 words removed.  Some trimming of extraneous material, two pieces of redundancy removed.

14:33.  91,484.  108 words removed.  Inefficient descriptions!  Pack, pack, pack!

14:36.  91,462.  130 words removed.  Inefficiency!  Once I improve the efficiency of the description, I can even add details while removing length.  I did that here.

14:39.  91,453.  139 words removed.  Changing a detail.  Something that was east is now north.  It makes more sense to me this way, but hopefully I didn't refer to its easterliness anywhere else in the book.

14:46.  91,430.  162 words removed.  Nixing a merchant thought.

14:47.  91,438.  154 words removed.  Restoring a merchant thought, but with brevity.

14:50.  91,431.  161 words removed.  Efficiency.

14:58.  91,402.  190 words removed.  This chapter felt like a struggle, but the tally looks pretty good.  190 words already and I'm only one chapter farther in.  Oh, and I took a break to brush my teeth.  All that chocolate, heh.

15:00.  91,394.  198 words removed.

15:05.  91,387.  205 words removed.  I found an actual error to take away from the text, hurray!

15:06.  91,364.  228 words removed.  I nixed an unnecessary detail.

15:07.  91,359.  233 words removed.  I'm always surprised when adding something and taking something else away results in a more brief document.  I don't restrict myself from adding content, notwithstanding my 500 word objective.

15:11.  91,338.  254 words removed.  I got rid of something actually dumb.

15:12.  91,283.  309 words removed.  One of my worldbuilding details was out of place and unnecessary.  I got rid of it.  That's a good step towards my quota.

15:14.  91,267.  325 words removed.

15:22.  91,239.  353 words removed.  I felt like I couldn't remove very much, but I guess I'm actually making good progress.

15:25.  91,241.  351 words removed.  I took a few small things out, but then I extended a description to make it more loreful.

15:28.  91,205.  387 words removed.  I eliminated a detail that wasn't service the story well.  I wouldn't have gotten rid of it if I weren't trying for brevity.  I wonder if that was the right decision.

15:30.  91,203.  389 words removed.  Huh, that was shorter than what it replaced?

15:31.  91,188.  404 words removed.  I got rid of a contradictory detail and a just bad one.  I'm staring at a difficult bit of the story and wondering if I can do better.

15:34.  91,187.  405 words removed.  What, that was only one word shorter?

15:36.  I've reviewed 5,240 words.  Only that?  These chapters must be aberrantly short...  I'm going to merge two of them.

15:40.  91,173.  419 words removed.  Efficiency!

15:43.  91,170.  422 words removed.  That wasn't an efficiency decision this time, I rewrote something to improve its lore concordance.

15:48.  91,149.  443 words removed.  I got rid of a detail that made the land gods look bad and unsubtle.  They're usually good and usually subtle!

15:49.  91,147.  445 words removed.  I refined a description and it came up shorter!

15:50.  91,140.  452 words removed.  I got rid of some 'seems'.  My writing is 'unseemly'!

15:52.  91,101.  491 words removed.  I got rid of a detail that was interrupting the flow of a conversation.  I'm really close to my quota for the day, and I didn't go through nearly as much of the material as yesterday!

15:55.  91,071.  521 words removed.  I removed something that was Orachu being obnoxious.  Quota hit!

16:02.  91,063.  529 words removed.  Oof, I've discovered a section of the story where I made an extended error.  I have to rewrite something.

16:04.  91,079.  513 words removed.  Error fixed, rewrite in.  It extended the material a little bit.

16:08.  91,042.  550 words removed.  It's really satisfying when I remove enough material that adding something new doesn't extend the manuscript.

16:11.  91,022.  570 words removed.  Hm.  As I've worked on the material today, I've developed a desire to remove at least 592 words, so that tomorrow's word count removal will be slightly easier to calculate.

16:19.  90,945.  647 words removed.  I added something characterful!

16:26.  90,958.  634 words removed.  Had to add some stuff.

16:28.  90,887.  705 words removed.  I reviewed 9,558 words today.  I'll be starting next time at Chapter 13.

16:32.  Wait, the words reviewed count is slightly higher than that.  10,263 words.

16:45.  Tequila and Squirt is a pretty good combination.  Complementary flavors.

21:38.  I've eaten a ton of food tonight and it's not making me satisfied.  I think I need to spend more of the day on my writing.  Writing is when I'm satisfied.
