12:44.  49,127.  49,139.  I don't have any great ideas as to what to have happen next.

(This part added the next day.)  2.8 miles.  485 kcal.  10,016 steps. 2 hours, 4 minutes, and 37 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  I wasn't very focused yesterday.  Not returning to regularly update my daylog was a bad sign.  Still, I did get to 49,973 words written, so the day's tally was 846.  I have more ideas now, too.  I took it easy yesterday, but still thought creatively.
