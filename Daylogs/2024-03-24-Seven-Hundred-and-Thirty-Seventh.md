9:00.  67,919.

11:56.  68,203.  I just watched most of an episode of Hazbin Hotel.  I've been obsessing over that show.  It's starting to creep into my narrative thoughtspace, where it is actually quite unwelcome.

11:58.  I haven't been highly productive this morning.  I wrote a little bit at the start of the morning, and then I was overcome by tiredness and pain, so that much of the intervening interval was spent...  I think literally on the couch.

14:07.  69,272.  This writing is slowing down.  1,353 words of progress.

16:43.  70,177.  2,258 words of progress.  

17:26.  70,307.  2,388 words of progress.

18:09.  70,307.  I haven't been working on this.  I got sideswiped by a meme video that Akity put on after his broadcast of Godzilla stopped working.

19:36.  70,310.  I've mostly just been feeling miserable.  Unproductive.  I've come back to my story repeatedly, thinking about how I'm reluctant to pursue the idea that I had for writing next in it.
