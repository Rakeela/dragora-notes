I walked out of class early today.  I was just too tired.  It was only a study day.  My lab partner can handle this week's assignment.

Yesterday's nanowrimo writing went really well.  I finished in record time.  I'm starting even later today.  Hopefully lightning will strike twice.

Each time I stop writing to record my progress, I'm stalled and having trouble continuing.

Today's nanowrimo file is starting at 1,797 words.  Yesterday, I was looking forward to working more on this one today.  Hopefully today goes well.

2,316 words.  519 progress, 1,148 to go.
