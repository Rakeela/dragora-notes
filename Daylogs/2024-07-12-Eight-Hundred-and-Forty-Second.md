8:31.  79,035.

9:44.  79,396.  I also wrote something small for a friend.

13:04.  80,647.  Ugh.  I'm in the wind for context.  Having trouble focusing.

16:16.  82,285.  3,250 words of progress.

17:04.  I have been on break since my last time point!  I went out for food.  I had a big fish burrito and a side of curly fries.

17:17.  I have not gotten back to work yet.  I watched a cool Wings of Fire analysis video about Kinkajou, which pointed out that she's a much more impressive dragon than the prose portrays her.  The comments pointed out that she's even willing to fight.  She's an all-around roarsome dragon.

17:22.  Okay, I'm getting back to work.  82,285.

19:43.  84,708.

19:44.  5,673 words of progress.  I am starting to be tempted by lazy writing.  The amount of effort I can put into the work is dwindling.  It may be wise to stop working.

20:00.  Yeah, I guess I have to stop.
