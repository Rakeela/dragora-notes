Well, today was a day for Stellaris.  I'm only playing on ensign, but it's kind of more fun when I have the advantage.  (Ensign applies no bonus to player or AI, but I'm better at the game than the AI is.)  My psionic materialist empire has vassalized half of the galaxy in the name of pacifism and xenophilia.  I filled out the Harmony tradition, so they're ostensibly utopian, but they formed a covenant with the evil(?) shroud intelligence(s) "Whisperers of the Void" and also plastered the third of the galaxy that they govern directly with black ops sites.

They're a police state with vile cutthroat politics, but at the same time I typically play the game recruiting all the "righteous" governors.  I fire all the enforcers and rely on the righteous governors to control crime.  This suggests that my Mandate of Kobb are a very efficient police state with a minimum of actual police and a deep elite hostility to the underworld.
