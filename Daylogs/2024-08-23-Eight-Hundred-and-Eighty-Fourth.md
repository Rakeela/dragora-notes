9:10.  50,656.  The Fall of Foyis.

9:44.  3,158 words edited.  50,694.

9:47.  I am so torn!  Do I call this book 'done' and start writing another book in its series, or do I keep going?  I think for now I should keep going, but note that Chapter Fifteen seemed like a satisfying book-break point in case I want to break it up into a series down the line.

14:53.  52,267.  1,611 words of progress.  It's been pretty slow going.

18:09.  54,119.  3,463 words of progress.  Taking a break.

21:05.  55,943.  5,287 words of progress.  I forgot to mark when I resumed work earlier, but it wasn't a long break.
