7:42.  I ate some dried green beans at 5:30 and felt pretty proud of my moderation, until I ate a slice of cake at 6:15.  Still.  If I eat only that, and fast the rest of the day, I'll have reduced my daily food consumption vs what I was eating while tracking a fast for a day and "eating one meal".  I drank one energy drink and I'm about to drink another.

18:52.  I have not kept to a fast at all today.

21:03.  It's really pleasant to eat lightly and occasionally on my stash.  I need to do this more often.

(This part added the next day.)
I spent yesterday working on Hc Svnt Dracones stuff.  I got two character profiles done and a 'do three more' note added to my files.  I would ordinarily have used this space to record how much I walked the day before, but I witlessly started the treadmill and walked for an hour on yesterday's timer, screwing up two days of records.  I got about 7 and a half hours in yesterday, at "1.1 mph", which is to say I had the machine set to 1.2 mph.
