16:26.  I was using the treadmill when I sneezed while trying to pause it.  Or did I pause it while trying to sneeze?  The co-occurrence of these two things cost me today's treadmill progress log.

18:29.  8,941.

20:58.  9,226.

21:47.  9,975.

22:10.  10,112.

23:22.  1,171 words of progress.  I haven't done anything else with this since my last timepoint; I got absorbed in watching stuff with Akity.  Age of Resistance has awe-inspiring puppetry!

(This part added the next day.)  1.5 miles.  276 kcal.  5,652 steps.  1 hour, 16 minutes, and 55 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.  This is more than a third of the walking I did yesterday, but I'm not sure how much more than a third.
