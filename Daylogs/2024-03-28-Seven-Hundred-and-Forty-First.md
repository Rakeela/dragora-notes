11:46.  I'm staring at my writing thinking of what Kistaro encouraged me to do with it.  Kistaro wants me to pivot one of my characters into being a detective.  Zir argument was surprisingly solid.

12:35.  79,740.  Wait, what?  I have to update yesterday's tally.

13:45.  80,139.  399 words of progress.

17:06.  80,971.  ARGH.  Progress is glacial today.  I'm struggling to conceive of the next bit of the story.  I'm *thinking*.  I can only inch forward while the next major plot beat is unanswered.

17:11.  I found a giant chocolate bar in my downstairs closet today.  I've ransacked that closet for sweets so many times it seems unfathomable that I left one there.  I ate part of it, felt it was unimpressive.  I ate a bit more, and still felt it was unimpressive.  I've regretted it twice, but I threw away half the bar.  It's a ridiculous thing to regret the disposal of second-rate chocolate.

17:28.  It's a weird thing that every time I try to fast, I get opportunities at food.  If I fast poorly, they're bad opportunities.  Second rate temptations, like things that I'm very used to, or novel things that just aren't very good.  If I fast really well, they're great opportunities.  My favorite stuff, or delicious things I've never had before.  What's weird though is that it happens every time.  Not only do I find tempting stuff while going out looking for it, I even find tempting stuff while sitting at home going over familiar ground.  It's like the world warps to feed me more or better food if I restrict my eating.  Finding a giant chocolate bar in a familiar location is an example of the world seeming to warp to feed me after I've been fasting.  It even fits the pattern of being an inferior good while fasting poorly.

17:51.  81,270.  1,530 words of progress.

19:19.  81,954.  2,214 words of progress.

19:21.  81,937.  2,149 words of progress.  I trimmed something earlier in the story.  Something I had just written reminded me of it, and it was outdated relative to information established later in the draft.
