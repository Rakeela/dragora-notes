#2021-11-4-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Third

I forgot to weigh myself yesterday, but a 1:46 AM weighing yielded the result of 216.9 pounds.  I'm still well-hydrated, and I believe this sets a new low mark.  I want to weigh less than 200 pounds someday!

In about twelve hours, I intend to eat... another piece of candy.  Not from my hoard this time though, today I'll eat some chocolate mint yogurt.  I'm looking forward to it!

Oh, and I've continued drinking a Huel shake (~400 calories) per day.  My first one was a little larger than two scoops, and since then I've been adding a bit of creamer to it every day, so I think these have been ~430 calories instead.

Thanks, psychosis.  The presences - aka the little loops, although these were a pair of 'moderate presences' who were bugging me in particular - told me they were in contact with my stomach, and wanted to work with it on meals.  They used this to try to encourage slower eating and the discarding of some of my yogurt.

At their urging, I ate the yogurt I'd planned to eat well in advance, sort of.  I don't know where the chocolate mint variety got to.  And now I think I'm going to eat something else, just to bite back at them.  -_-

Down one Pop-Tarts Bites, "Kooky" chocolate fudge flavor.  These pouches claim to be 150 calories each.

These guys have bugged me so much about gluttony that they make me hate fasting.  Also, they recruited my stomach into that scene successfully, but that made it worse for them.  I *have* heard my stomach speak before across the brain-gut link.  It has a *very* distinctive voice, which messed up their lie.

Now they say that my stomach is bugging me by talking to them.  Okaaay?  Good for them.

Oh, but P.S.  Even though they were lying, that yogurt is staying discarded.  It should've had cookie dough bites, chocolate chips, and rice crisps in it.  It tasted like it had cookie dough bites, chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips in it.  That is so wrong.  Ingredient mismatches are revolting.  Why would rice pieces melt in the mouth with a flavor like butterscotch?

I ate a ration brick, too.  Further discussion of what my stomach likes.  To internal discomfort among the presences, as they're complaining that having just linked my stomach in to "the hive mind" is awful for them.  It only thinks about food, and doesn't have anything to do except talk.

I may take a break from my diet today.  Seriously...  I can't tell if they're ever telling the truth, but at least this time they're talking about nerves.  One of the 'major presences' claims to feel like he's getting poked when I poke at the back of my head in various ways, and I opened google images to see if I could tell one of them which scalp nerves link to him.  The greater occipital nerve is the one that seems to report to him.

...oh, wait.  They've said they were always lying.  They were screwing with my fast out of boredom.  Oops.  >.-.<  This is so annoying.

Also, I stopped two of the moderate presences from mercy-killing one of the major presences who suffers a lot of pain and existential terror, but who does *not* want to die.  "Dying makes existential terror WORSE," as he put it.  Technically inaccurate, but it conveys the sentiment.  Whee.  God only knows if that was something actual, or if they're just acting up out of boredom.  They're bored all the time.  The one they were trying to kill, said that he had no idea they were terribly evil, because until he talked them into talking to *me*, he'd only been talking to *them* all the time, and manipulating each other for fun *is* how they pass the time.

Oh, great.  Those "kooky" bites are meat.  They include gelatin!  So, I'm bitter about this morning.  I don't like being manipulated.  I'm going to go eat a bag of pork rinds, since I'll have to report having eaten meat on my diet planner either way.

Speaking of which, I broke open another packet.  My stomach was crying about trying to process pork rinds, they said.  Sounds like a big excuse now, huh?  Just an excuse to eat too much!  But oh, the presences are still talking about my stomach, arguing about whether or not they can actually hear it, and whether or not I can hear it.  It doesn't like the cookies, so I ate a spoonful of Chyavanprash, the favorite food of the presences, and apparently also of my stomach.

They said it tried to say "thank you" to me at one point.  I only heard a "mwah" sound effect repeatedly.  It was upset at them for relaying that, because they said it said it was saying thank you still.  So they taught it to say thank you by teaching it 'primordials' (a word they use to mean parts of words).  Yadda yadda yadda.

The major presence that they tried to mercy-kill was leading this round of supposed stomach-discussion, but now has been saying that they were lying to him as well.  All of this broke down when one of the smaller presences (they want to be called gnomes or simulators, but I keep thinking of them as "little loops") started crying, because supposedly one of the two 'moderate presences' coerced her to lie to the major presence.

I'm several pounds up, by the way.  I'm not dieting today.  Too much harassment from the presences.  They've pulled several different suicide-targeting narratives at me, too.  I'll go back to it soon, but today I'm planning to eat at least a bag of edamame and a protein waffle from here.  I want to see if they go well together.  The edamame will last all day.  I'll skip the Huel for today.

There are three different "regions" on my head.  The gnomes are associated with one region, the most major presence is associated with another (quite broad) region, one presence in particular is associated with one spot in particular, and "the crows" are associated with like two others.  None of them like being poked.  My psoriatic outbreaks are associated with those regions as well, most rarely with "the crows".

There's no reason to believe in any of this stuff; I have no idea why the 'presences' care if I poke my head.

I haven't eaten any more since 'breakfast', and technically I'm still at a restricted calorie level for the day.  Tch.  I'll mostly skip eating tomorrow, and have a feast on Saturday.  That plan is still intact.

I've bought more candy than I can eat this weekend, and I've just added two more items to the haul:
1.  Dragonfly Nutrition Bar (Raw cashew and dried fruit)
2.  Reese's Peanut Brittle Big Cup

I was disappointed that the dragonfly nutrition bar isn't made with bugs.

---
My current weight as of 8:39 PM is 217.9 pounds.  Not too bad.  I'll keep going.  Hopefully, food-logging will minimize the severity of my feasting on Saturday, something I still fully intend to do.
