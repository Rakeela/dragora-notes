15:26.  Wow, I have been so demoralized today.  I got up at 7:30 and I didn't do aaaaaanything.  I laid around poking at my phone for hooooours.  I was eventually interrupted by a dentist visit.  Yay.  That's all I've gotten done so far today.

15:27.  37,130.

20:15.  39,585.  2,455 words of progress.  I kinda want to stop.  I've been productive since I started, but have I done enough for the night?  I could keep going.  Should I keep going while I can?  Akity would tell me to stop.  Akity's advice is bad.  He'd never approve of my current plan to embark on a thirteen day fast.  I have to keep stuff from Akity because his advice hurts me.

20:25.  No more writing.  I've just been thinking about the setting and telling Akity about it.  I'm not sure if I'm writing more, but I haven't in the past ten minutes.
