Trying to get established with a new system hasn't been going that well.  There's just an intrinsic friction in switching which software I'm taking my notes on.  This hurt my productivity and focus today.

If we start being able to comprehensively push back bio-entropic processes and restore people to "known good states", will that result in dangerous homogenizations of the public as people are pushed towards shared identical parameter optimizations?  I'm worrying about the social implications of rejuvenation.

Surprisingly, my weight still seems to be easing downwards despite the fact that I'm now eating more per day than the caloric intake which previously seemed to result in frustrating slow weight gain.  My current diet is "eat at liberty, but only Huel."  I've been cheating only slightly.  I've been eating more than three servings of Huel per day, and thus I have been eating more than the 1200 calories at which I expect my weight to trend upwards.  Yet I have a new "low water mark" - lowest achieved weight - and I currently stand at 232 pounds with a wet towel upon my head.
