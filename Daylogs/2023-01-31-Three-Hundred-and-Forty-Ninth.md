I've eaten some nuts and drank a fair amount of soda, so this isn't a fresh first-thing-in-the-morning weighing, but I just weighed myself and I came up at 251.3 pounds.

My morale is bad today.  I'm not depressed, I think?  I'm just consumed by a resentful apathy.  I don't want to do anything.  Everything feels bad.  Maybe this is a form of depression.  I don't know.

It's not true that I don't want to do anything.  I want to go across town on my bike or scooter.  I want to eat meat.  Those are the things I want to do right now.  I've been exercising on my new treadmill instead.  I've walked 2.3 miles so far and burned an estimated 401 kcal.  

Make that 3.2 miles and 569 kcal.

4.4 miles and 785 kcal.  I ate a 390 kcal falafel sandwich.  That should be all I eat today.

5.7 miles and 1002 kcal.  This calorie burn estimate seems high.  Then again, I have walked for 4 hours and 17 minutes.

6.8 miles and 1185 kcal.  That's five hours, 2 minutes, and 53 seconds of treadmill usage.  I've put the treadmill away as I'm starting to ache.

New file.  Having trouble getting started on this one.  Lots of ideas, but I'm struggling to decide between them and pick which ones to use.

345 words on the file.  1,519 words of progress.  That's it for today.

I ate a slice of keto bread with some soynut butter smeared onto it.  That's over my calorie target, but eh.  I exercised a ton.  I weighed myself just now, and I came in at...  251.3 pounds.  Heh.  Let's see how long that stays.
