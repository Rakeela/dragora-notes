8:18.  I have been struggling to get moving on my work.  I am very fatigued.

9:11.  I've been writing rhetoric.  I'm still fatigued.

9:50.  I played some LCS...  I guess I played more than I expected?  It's frustrating.  I save-scummed twice in this time due to raids that resulted in deadly police chases afterwards.  I haven't mastered early game funding and training methods.

9:56.  I did discover that it generates Lawyers with 8-10 charisma and an awful lot of prostitutes only have 5.  With a bit of training, that means lawyers are better at prostitution than prostitutes are.

10:19.  89,942.

11:55.  90,289.  Credit 2,906 words of editing.

12:30.  90,199.  Credit 2,428 words of editing.

13:48.  I ate too much again today.  I eat early in the morning, and I can feel it all day.  It's hard for me to eat moderately in the morning.

13:55.  There's a small increasing trend to my weight over the past 7 days.

14:16.  I have had such bad gas today.  I was constipated for four days, so I took laxatives.  I've been gassy since.  Being constipated sucked less, but it was more alarming.  Gas doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong.  Not having bowel movements DOES mean there's something wrong.

16:44.  91,083.  4,410 words on the chapter.

17:07.  90,933.  991 words of progress.  Credit 4,261 words of editing.  9,595 words of editing.

17:34.  I'm distracted and reluctant to continue.  I'm going to take a break, and maybe stop for the night.  I'm not sure if I'll get back to work this time, and I'm comfortable with myself either way.  I want to see how I feel in an hour.

19:04.  I spent a while reading a book of gay history that I've got.  It's 635 pages long and I'm 132 pages into it.  Reading through it is no small project.  Oh, and 90,933.

19:36.  90,490.  Credit 2,370 words of editing.  I may need to redo what I did today.  Some of this material needs to be entirely replaced.  May need to be.  548 words of progress.

19:39.  Oh, and so I have it conveniently in my own records.  11,965 words of editing.
