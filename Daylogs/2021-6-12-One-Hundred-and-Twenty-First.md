#2021-6-12-One-Hundred-and-Twenty-First

The leftovers on my mung beans and celery (from [[2021-6-10-One-Hundred-and-Nineteenth]] were better cold than they had been hot.  That just went from "highly disappointing" to "I think I'll cook this again for myself".

Mung beans don't need to be softened overnight.  Softening mung beans for cooking them just involves boiling them first.  Cooked with inadequate water, the mung beans were only partially softened.  The same could be said of the celery.  I think that texture was okay, and I discovered while eating mung bean sweets (which I very much recommend) that mung beans themselves are tasty.

Mung bean sweets may be a good way to get people to associate a planty flavor with deliciousness.  Try some!

I made another batch of keto fudge to try using mascarpone this time in place of some of the cashew butter.  The resulting texture was very smooth and soft, but I could kind of tell that I was eating sweetened cheese.  On the other hand, sweetened cheese is not so bad.

Are there a lot of cheeses that sweeten and resolidify nicely?  Does cacao butter help them do so?  If I reduce the sweetener and just use this to create a more solid cheese product, I wonder if I could mix it with savory ingredients instead.  I wonder if partially softened mung beans could be served embedded in a spicy cheese wedge.

Trying to look this up, I see a lot has been written about how resolidifying cheese goes *wrong*, but it didn't really go wrong here.  I got a consistent, homogenous product.  Now I want to see if I can use cacao butter to make savory keto dishes with cheese, too.
