9:34.  I ate a bowl of dill salad, a couple of dill chips, and a bar of reserve chocolate.  I'm going after a second bar of reserve chocolate now.

9:35.  60,151.

12:00.  I ate another reserve bar.  That's a third.  Whyyyyy is my usage creeping up.  I'm such a chocolate addict.

12:33.  I just ate a spicy lentil wrap and now I'm prepping a cheese and mushroom flatbread.  Also, 60,254.  I meant to work earlier, but after doing a very small amount, I got distracted.

12:40.  60,302.  I have no inspiration, is the problem.  When I have no ideas, it is especially difficult to stay focused and continue the work.

15:30.  Taking naproxen and acetominophen.  I've mostly been reading, though I did a bit of writing hours ago now.  60,567.  It's been so hard to make things up.  And ow, I'm in a lot of pain right now.

20:00.  I've been doing TTRPG stuff.  It's been so fun!  Hours of pleasure.  I love GMing for my group.

20:01.  I was thinking though, there's so much mind-data that would be lost.  Any simulation of me based on my recovered data would be intrinsically incomplete.  It would be someone else, because of how many details I am incapable of recording.  I'm not talking about my physical appearance... that is the least important part of me, and I hope that any society capable of memetic resurrection would allow me to change my body.  Yet I can't hope to record every detail of my thoughts.

20:04.  I am eating a fourth bar of reserve chocolate.  The purpose of life is eating chocolate.  Mm!

21:23.  I have eaten a container of ramen noodles and several handfuls of dill chips.  Even though I am tracking my food consumption now, I cannot find the will to stop eating.  I am going to eat a fifth bar of reserve chocolate.  I thought tracking my food consumption would make me stop, but it does not feel shameful!  It still does not.  I am no longer hiding it from myself, and fundamentally, it does not feel like a mistake to eat.
