13:07.  50,472.

13:16.  50,510.  My morale is bad.

15:18.  Credit 7 words editing.  50,606+7.  Credit 103 words writing.  Uh...  Credit 38 words writing.  New baseline: 50,606.  141 words of progress.  My morale is very bad.  Working through the fog of demoralization has been bitterly hard.  I mostly haven't.  I spent a while donating time to publishing rhetoric.  If I can't feel good, at least I can contribute to a better future?

15:20.  I forgot my antidepressant today.

15:21.  Credit 1 word editing.  New baseline:  50,605.

15:27.  50,703.

15:41.  I don't want to write this scene.

16:12.  50,817.  353 words of progress.

16:16.  I am so hungry!  I want to go out shopping for yet more food items to theoretically someday eat while not fasting.  But I have basically exhausted my city of new food items!  I cannot even find more on Amazon.

16:29.  I bought a pile of candy bars I haven't had yet from Amazon.  Expensive, rare stuff!  Mm!  They will last quite a while, I think.  I have lots to go through.

16:57.  51,289.  825 words of progress.  807 words on the chapter.

17:23.  51,378.  I did some more writing, then I took a break to do some catch-up on Nationstates.  914 words of progress.

17:40.  51,719.  1,255 words of progress.  I'm not sure I'll hit quota today.  I'm sick of writing.  1,236 words on the chapter.

17:46.  I'm going to go play Starfield for a few minutes.  Or however long it holds my attention.  I haven't quite hit quota, but I wrote something difficult.

19:24.  Sometimes I get a kind of "done" sensation that tempts me to go to bed.

(This part added the next day.)  I didn't go straight to bed.  I argued online for a while.  It's volunteering.  Without misinformation and hatred, politics would work much better.  6.0 miles, 922 kcal.  18,962 steps.  3 hours, 30 minutes, 9 seconds.  Average speed 1.7 mph.
