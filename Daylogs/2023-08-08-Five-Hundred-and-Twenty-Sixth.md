8:57.  While I wait for Bombe to finish calculating a level with thousands of regions, I'm going to look at Greeve's Ambition.  10,024 words on the file.  Whoops, wait.  That's more than I calculated as having 'finished with' yesterday.  I need to go back and amend yesterday's writing productivity.

12:54.  11,251.  1,227 words of progress.  I've mostly been playing Bombe.  Progress is super-slow now.  I'm chipping away at the infinite boards and they don't fall quickly.

14:13.  12,537.  2,962 words on the chapter.  2,513 words of progress.

14:28.  I kept playing Bombe, but the balance of Bombe to writing shifted back towards writing.  That's enough Bombe for today, I'm closing it.

15:01.  12,807.  Chapter complete.  2,783 words of progress.  I'm taking a break.

18:44.  15,140.  11.6 miles.  2,120 kcal.  43,187 steps.  9 hours, 47 minutes, 16 seconds.  I forgetfully kept walking well into the ninth hour.

20:30.  I think I should log my word count as done for the night.  Quick sanity check...  2,340 words on the chapter.  Okay.  I didn't overrun my chapter allotment.
