7:44.  Just took naproxen.

8:25.  I've been reading TvTropes, specifically the Spore pages.  That game was a big disappointment.

8:31.  Credit 71 words edited.  71,279.

9:26.  71,623.  I'm glad I got to work relatively quickly today.  If I feel like I've put in a full workday before the evening falls, I may actually catch up on my reading.  I have so much to read - and VNs to play, which also count as reading.

11:23.  73,032.  I'm going to take a break and catch up on NationStates.

12:36.  Back to work.  73,032.

13:52.  74,333.  I ate half of an entire cake.  It was amazing.  Red velvet with cream cheese icing.

15:40.  74,574.  I have been hard distracted since the last time point and I'm not sure I've been two hours of productive.

18:04.  77,245.  5,966 words of progress.
