12:43.  Well, I'm getting started bore 13:00, at least.  33,694.

14:08.  34,580.  886 words of progress.  Not bad for the time investment, but I'm starting to feel weirdly burnt.  I took a little break (just a few minutes) and it didn't help.  Rather than crisping by forcing it at my current stall point, I'm going to take a longer break.  I'll get a bit farther into No Man's Sky.

16:44.  Wow, that absorbs the attention completely.  Oh my god.

17:52.  I got completely absorbed reading lore from the game.  It's so miserable.

17:54.  I set another new caffeine consumption record today.  I'm still craving more.  It's an insatiable desire.

19:55.  Kistaro encouraged me to load up No Man's Sky again once I met quota for the day.  34,994.  1,300.  Not there yet.  I want to break 1,667 words.

21:31.  36,160.  2,466 words of progress.  I'm considering hanging it up.  I would like to play a bit more No Man's Sky before going to bed.
