Merry Christmas!

I finally get to eat my candy hoard.  I didn't end up keeping the fast to today, so I didn't end up cataloguing the whole stash in regular order.  Instead, what I'm going to do is that I'm going to run it down as I eat it.
1) Peeps Gingerbread Men.  Marshmallows.  140 calories.  Ooh, they actually taste like gingerbread!
2) Cadbury Flake.  Chocolate bar.  168 calories.  What a mess this is to eat, I had to fetch out a plate to avoid getting chocolate crumbs everywhere.  It's delicious.  This fall-apart chocolate melts very quickly in the mouth.  Good first impression, bad aftertaste that seemed to get worse as it lingered.
3) Niagara Chocolates Double Chocolate Mint Cups.  As described.  120 calories (per serving; eating one).  Center is not liquid as depicted, but is a soft minty chocolate solid.  Interior does melt readily in the mouth, while shell of cup resists melting.

That's breakfast.  Today will be a day for an absolutely irresponsible amount of calories... but I'm already looking forward to eating something that isn't sweet.  So I've heated up three pre-cooked falafel (188 calories).  Maybe today I'll log everything I eat and we'll find out how much I'm eating.

Let's have a bit more for lunch!
4)  Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Date Royale.  Chocolate-covered peanut butter filled dates.  47 calories each.  I thought I'd be eating these in larger numbers, but they're individually wrapped!  In that case, I'll stop at one.  It was decent, but I've still got so many things to try.
5) Vergani Gusto Cappucino Nougat.  Soft nougat.  150 calories per third of the bar, but it's not sectioned; I think I pulled off half of it, so 225 calories.  I've never eaten a soft nougat bar before.  That was very interesting.

Starting with a new file.  My target is theoretically 86 words, but I'm unlikely to submit so few.  I'm already at 89 words on the new file.  I expect to finish my writing goal today.

---
80 calories of keto bread, 675 calories of mushroom agnolatti.

---
544 words on the file.

6)  Chocolate Works Milk Chocolate Covered Oreo Cookies.  As described.  110 calories each.  Covering it in chocolate doesn't really change the nature of an Oreo cookie very much, so while this is nominally novel, I'm kinda disappointed.  I'll stop at one again.
7) Vosges Manchego and Cherry.  Chocolate bar.  Described as three servings, but sectioned unhelpfully into eight pieces.  I'll eat four, for 210 calories.  Manchego flavor is mild but appealing, gives a richer flavor.  Cherry flavor is very weak, just a hint of fruitiness.  This is mostly about the chocolate, not what was mixed into it, and it is good chocolate.
8) More Vergani Gusto Cappucino Nougat.  Review above.  225 more calories.  Best thing I tried today.

---
713 words on the file.  That's enough for this file.  Starting a new file.  For simplicity's sake, I'm just going to turn in this writing.

---
438 calories from seven more pre-cooked falafel.

---
268 words on the new file.  I'm turning it in.

A tally says I've eaten 2,626 calories so far today.  I'm still planning to have dinner, which will be chicken fettucini alfredo.  I'm not sure how to estimate my calorie intake from dinner.  At Kistaro's recommendation, I'm going to estimate that at 600 calories.  That'll bring today's caloric total to 3,226 calories.

This is why I have to fast!

P.S. 74 calories from a peppermint chocolate truffle.  Oop!
9)  Lindt Peppermint Cookie Chocolate Truffle.  Small minty chocolate ball.  74 calories.  It was as smooth as I was hoping it would be.
