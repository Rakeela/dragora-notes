8:08.  I started maybe two minutes ago.  106,559.

8:22.  106,569.  I got distracted by a Trope Talk video.  Overly Sarcastic Proudctions puts out a lot of good stuff, and the Trope Talk series is particularly good.

8:23.  106,661.  I found a bit of text that was in WE but not in my log.  So I actually wrote this bit yesterday...

8:32.  I've written 10 words so far today, yay.  I was just installing a check to see if the player knew what a lesser chromafeather is.

9:28.  106,985.

9:44.  107,068.  Progress feels slow.

19:34.  I haven't worked for the past ten hours, I think.  Practically a day off.  I guess it's Sunday... and now that my TTRPG games are both on the weekends, my weekends are probably going to be more conventional days off now.

19:54.  Oh, it's been 20 minutes.  I meant to get back to work on Wasteland Engineering, but...  I dunno.  I spaced.  I put some music on and didn't get back to it.  Anyways, I did a bit more work this morning, so I didn't cut right at 9:44.  I've got to update my wordcount.

19:55.  107,343.  This is how much I actually got done earlier before I cut off my work to do game stuff.  I also made a primitive map today.

21:34.  I've been watching an Echo review.  107,597.  Now I'm watching another Echo review.  1,038 words of progress.
