10:25.  This is yet another morning in which I got up at 6:30 only to end up sleeping for an unknown time on the couch.

20:20.  Oh, wow.  I totally forgot to write check-points on my writing today.  I started not long after the above time point, continued until 15:00, and just checked in to discover this.

20:21.  64,086.  65,121.

22:24.  65,302.  1,216 words of progress.
