11:19.  2,431.

11:52.  85,198.  No, I didn't just complete the rewrite.  I've decided to do this differently.

12:44.  Credit 2,667 words of editing.  88,536.  Oh, crud.  I made a mistake when putting the material back in earlier.  Let's see, to calculate my actual words of progress, I need to subtract an amount...

12:45.  The subtraction amount is 3,286 words.  So the base value is 85,250, and the actual progress value is 52.  I'm going to say 'credit 52 words written' and then establish a new base progress value of 88,536.  That's simplest.

13:53.  88,508.  Credit 3,250 words of editing.  Credit 188 words of writing.  Credit 6 words of writing.  Credit 19 words of writing.  Credit 7 words of writing.  Credit 19 words of writing.  Credit 11 words of writing.  Credit 228 words of writing.  Credit 11 words of writing.  Credit 7 words of writing.  188+6+19+7+19+11+228+11+7=496.

15:40.  89,610.  Credit 4,822 words of editing.  1,102+496+52.  1,650 words of progress.

15:47.  I'm taking a break.  Pleeeease let me get back to work afterwards.  (Prayer to myself.)

18:18.  I didn't get promptly back to work.  I published political rhetoric against rich people instead.

18:20.  Getting back to work now.

18:28.  Oof.  I stopped right before a challenging stretch for my rewrite project.

19:28.  89,942.  1,982 words of progress.  Credit 3,069 words of editing.

19:32.  That's 13,808 words of editing so far.  Can I stop for the evening?

19:35.  If I work at this rate, I'll have the next draft complete in a week.  I want to go do something else.  So I think I will.  Rewriting a book isn't too hard.  I was so intimidated by this task before I got started on it.
