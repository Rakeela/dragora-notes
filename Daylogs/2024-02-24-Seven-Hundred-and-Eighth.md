11:56.  I'm eating a bar of reserve chocolate.

14:00.

14:15.  Oops, I meant to update my food tracking.  I ate some fried tofu, some boiled spinach, and some vegetable gyoza.  What a delicious meal!  60,567.  I'm not sure if I'll write much right now, because my TTRPG group wants to play more today, but I'm excited by the next bit of writing.

15:01.  I ate six hershey's kisses and drank a cup of eggnog.  60,837.

22:54.  61,085.  Is that really how little I wrote today?  How shockingly unproductive.  248 words of progress.

22:55.  I thought that can't be right, and I checked yesterday's ending point.  60,567.  So I wrote 518 words today.

22:56.  8.6 miles.  1,503 kcal.  31,323 steps.  6 hours, 40 minutes, and 48 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.
