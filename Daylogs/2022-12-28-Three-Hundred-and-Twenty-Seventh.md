1)  Chocolove Ruby Chocolate.  Ruby Chocolate Bar.  160 calories per 1/3rd.  Tasty, but not especially fruity.  Very faintly fruity, I guess?  It tasted like chocolate, notwithstanding its unusual coloration.
2) Twix Cookie Dough.  200 calories.  Tasty, but not worth all the anticipation frankly.  I'm doubtful that I'll buy another one.

I also ate half a pizza.  Which is, oog.  It's too much food for me now.

Now that I've eaten this morning, I'm starting on a 72 hour fast that will end on Saturday morning.

Uuuugh.  Half a pizza is totally too much food.  It was too much last night, too.  I used to love eating this much pizza.  What happened!
