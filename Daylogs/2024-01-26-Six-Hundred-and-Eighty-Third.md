10:31.  I got up at 5:15, but I didn't accomplish anything before laying down again and getting up at 7:30.  I then proceeded to play The Viceroy (for the Commonwealth Unifiers) and take some notes.  14,230.

11:40.  14,863.  I'm going to pause work and catch up on my daily Nationstates play.

13:09.  I played Nationstates for a while, then got distracted with Race for the Galaxy.  Nothing to add to [[Preserved-Race-for-the-Galaxy-Tableaus]] this time.  I kinda want to play another round, but I want to get back to my writing, too.

14:18.  15,975.  1,745 words of progress.

14:58.  Credit 57 words to Ord (Worldbuilding).  16,580.

15:57.  17,594.  It's really exciting to go through so much worldbuilding in this story.  3,364 words of progress.

15:58.  72,406 words to the target wordcount.  It's more of an approaching deadline than something I'm excited about.  I have to keep the story within the constraint of that length objective.  It's challenging to tell stories within a limited wordcount; it'd be easier to sprawl on endlessly with my words.

17:01.  18,481.  4,251 words of progress.

18:01.  19,309.  5,079 words of progress.  This is very pure travelogue writing so far.  It's fun for me.

18:17.  No work since last timepoint.  I am feeling restless.  I want to stop working for the day.  Honestly, this pure travelogue writing is a bit disconcerting.  Praoziu is supposed to be evil.  It's so easy to characterize her in a charismatic way.

18:18.  19,325.

18:22.  19,320.  I won't bother retallying everything.  Five of my words were just bad.
