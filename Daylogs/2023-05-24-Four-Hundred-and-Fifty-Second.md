8:13.  I ate another five Peeps, whereupon I made a discovery about Peeps.  They're made with gelatin!  They're not vegetarian.

8:22.  I meant to add this to the note nine minutes ago.  I plan to keep the Peeps, but never buy any ever again.  That's how I've handled gelatin reveals in the past.

8:24.  I may talk to Kistaro about it.  Last time there was a gelatin reveal in something I'd been eating, it was reasonably healthy.  Peeps aren't healthy.  I'd only be clinging to the experience.

9:08.  I laid on the couch for a while, feeling overwhelmed by memories of past mistakes.

9:15.  I feel remarkably little inclination to record thoughts of past mistakes.

9:22.  I want to devour more sweets, but I already feel like i overate with a cookie and five Peeps.

9:32.  It's much easier to not ruminate on past mistakes while engaging with the world rather than laying on the couch.  Wow though, I'm still tired.

9:43.  I laid briefly back in bed.  On the ruminometer, the bed does almost as well as being engaged with my computer.

11:27.  With all the laying down and such, it's been hard to get going this morning.  I even made a trip to the grocery store to buy more cookies, since I exhausted my supply of "Decadent Red Velvet Chocolate Chunk".  Now I have 5x "Private Selection Ultimate Chocolate Chunk".  They were on discount in the clearance rack.  

11:30.  I am scatterbrained this morning.  My state of mind is annoying me.  I had trouble waking up in a timely manner, and now three and a half hours later I still have not gotten anything done.

11:44.  I have a book on mining in the neolithic and bronze age.  It is hard to read quickly.  The diagrams are fascinating.  The book doesn't describe its insights, so it yields them only slowly to study.

11:45.  I have a deeply frustrating desire for chocolate, and I have had it for hours.  Noooo!  I had chocolate for breakfast!  I am going to eat some cheese.

12:08.  Hunger quelled by cheese.  I still think cheese is a slimming food.  Now, finally, I need to get to work on Kura and Kaire.  11,032 words on the file.  1,720 words on the chapter.

12:30.  I just ate four "green bean chips".  Beans, salt, tapioca starch, oil.  I need a dieting tracker.  I'm flagrantly misusing my "fasting" tracker.

12:36.  11,079 words on the file.  1,763 words on the chapter.  40 words of progress.  I'm stalled.  I don't know what should happen next.

12:54.  11,390.  2,074 on the chapter.  358 words of progress.  Bah!  That was frustrating.  I just spent three hundred words having Kaire hemm and haww about something.  That doesn't advance the story!  It just... advances his characterization.

13:08.  11,507.  2,192 on the chapter.  475 words of progress.

13:32.  11,782.  2,458 words on the chapter.  750 words of progress.

14:00.  11,909.  2,583 words on the chapter.  877 words of progress.  Chapter complete, probably.  One more thing to check.

14:03.  11,905.  2,579 words on the chapter.  873 words of progress.  Trimmed something.  There's still a bit of redundancy here, but hopefully it's okay.

15:08.  12,733.  824 words on the chapter.  1,701 words of progress.

15:39.  13,130.  1,225 words on the chapter.  2,098 words of progress.

16:03.  13,600.  1,687 on the chapter.  2,568 words of progress.  The rule that each chapter must be between 2,500 words and 3,000 words is really stretching my creativity.  If I didn't have that rule, I'd call this one 'done'.  But Kura and Kaire in its first draft had unduly short chapters.  This one would be way too short at 1,687 words.

16:09.  I want to take a break, but I have no idea what I want to do.  I guess I could read.  I have a perfectly enjoyable book on primitive mining, but I've also still been trying to suffer through The Wearle.  It's a book club book.

16:21.  I read 5% of The Wearle.  It was a far better 5% than the other 31% of the book that I've read, but on the whole I still dislike the book.

16:37.  I'm just faffing about.  I started to get some kinda headache... or at least some kind of head sensation...  that was why I wanted a break.  I guess it's fading, but it's not faded.  Now I'm thinking about it.  I wonder if painkillers would increase my productivity.  I'm going to go try that.

17:05.  The child who preceded me - Ryan - wanted to own a gold or silver cross as a jewellery item.  I wonder how different my life would have been if that wish had been granted.

17:15.  I want those books I ordered on Manichaeism to get here.  I'm eager to read more about it.

17:34.  "This book is all harsh warnings against compassion... or maybe warnings that truth itself isn't compassionate, I'm not sure.  Anyways.  It was interesting.  I don't think the author is shadow-touched.  It got me thinking though, *truth* isn't compassionate, but we *wield* the truth, and truth can be wielded *for* compassion...  Make sense?"  I wrote this for a roleplay, but I can't use it yet.  I'm saving it here.

17:36.  13,618.  1,705 on the chapter.  2,586 words of progress.  Tweaking something.  This should help me figure out how to continue it later... or tomorrow, at this rate.  I haven't come up with the next scene.

19:58.  I played Stellaris for a while.  Egalitarian Spiritualist Pacifists.  Not xenophiles.

20:05.  I thought Stellaris would focus me more.  I don't think it worked.  I feel emptier than before I played.  It bled off some of my energy.  I'd been studying avidly.  Now I don't feel like doing that or anything.  Reading books feels like achieving something.  Playing Stellaris doesn't really.  Before I started, I kinda wanted to rush off to Half Price Books and buy a new religion book.  Now I still kinda want to do that.  Even though I've already got three books open that I'm studying.

21:40.  Half Price Books closes at 8 PM!  I didn't get in.  Oh well, it would've been a waste of money anyways.  I came back and watched Kistaro play Tears of the Kingdom for a while.
