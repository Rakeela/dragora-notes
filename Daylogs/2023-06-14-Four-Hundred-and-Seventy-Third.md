7:23.  I woke up twelve minutes ago.  My first thoughts of the day, at least of what I wanted to record to my diary:  I've been reading more nonfiction than fiction lately.  I have six fiction books on my desk and four nonfiction books, but I recently cycled a nonfiction book off my desk faster than any of the others.

10:44.  0 words on the file.  216 words on the file.  I was thinking that I would take today off, but that idea lasted three hours.  I've started my next project.

11:44.  344 words on the file.  Kura and Kaire may be easier to write than Theoma.

17:27.  1,253 on the first file, which I abandoned.  897 on the second file.

17:45.  1,080 on the file.

17:54.  1,133 on the file.  Theoma is harder than Kura and Kaire.

19:09.  1,773 on the file.  Ugh.  Today has really sucked.  I took three hours off in the morning and then I've been working the rest of the time, while really unhappy, too.  I've written 3,026 words.  Maybe this is enough for today.

19:31.  1,983 on the file.

19:45.  2,115 on the file.

19:51.  2,114 on the file.  I'm going to take a break.  3,367 words of progress.  I thought I was going to stop at 19:09 and then I just continued...

22:22.  Yeah, I did finally stop at 19:51.  I haven't really done anything since but continue to feel miserable.
