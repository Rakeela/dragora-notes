11:14.  I accidentally turned off the treadmill, so I have to record my session stats.  1.6 miles.  278 kcal.  5913 steps.  1 hour, 10 minutes, and 48 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.

11:40.  410.  425.

14:03.  899.  489 words of progress.

17:27.  1,300.  I felt sick for a while earlier, hindering progress.

17:33.  I'm not feeling inspired by the places that I'm creating.  In order to write a Slantworld book, I have to find two points of great interest.  Today I'm working on filling out the political map of Slantworld.

18:45.  2,002.  1,592 words of progress.  I've added a few interesting locales, and my story-mind is starting to spark, but I haven't found the blaze of inspiration that I need to write a book.  I have at least learned the secret of inspiration, which is to keep working.  The old Rings of Chaos setting could never inspire me, I only write four documents for it, and I didn't track my productivity.  The Slantworld documents are growing and I'm tracking my productivity as I work on them.

19:34.  2,188.  1,778 words of progress.

20:09.  2,289.  1,879 words of progress.

20:12.  New file.  2,281.

21:06.  2,500.  219 words written.  2,098 words of progress.
