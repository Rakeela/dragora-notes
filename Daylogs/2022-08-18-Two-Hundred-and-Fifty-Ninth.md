Another problem with creating Theoma lore for Cultist Simulator.  I don't have a calendar of celebrations in Theoma.  The Grail-4 lore "A Megalesian Incantation" makes reference to "Megalesia", a festival deidcated to Cybele, who was known as the Great Mother, and who was the goddess of birth.  This ties in strongly with Grail's stature as the lore of birth.  It would be VERY fitting for the Chains-4 lore to refer to a celebration of some kind, because Chains is also the lore of feasting in Theoma even though the principle of birth is considered to be shattered in that world.

If there were very famous festival days in Theoma, I could easily make a reference to one of them into the new Chains-4 lore.  My worldbuilding hasn't gotten that far yet.

This project is helping me see what I could have, and don't.
