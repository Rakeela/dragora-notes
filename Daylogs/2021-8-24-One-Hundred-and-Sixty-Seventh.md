I have a different archive also.  It's named Theoma, and it contains my notes for the Theoma project.  The people who violated my privacy because I rejected conservative pro-child-molestation norms (they call themselves anti-child-molestation, but liberalism destroys child molestation more effectively, and they HATE liberalism) have read my Theoma archive, much to my frustration.  I stopped shining the knobs of invasive people, and lo my privacy got worse than ever, because God forbids that people should reject sexual abuses.  Apparently.  The force of God adheres the people who hate me to violating my privacy, even though I've been honest consistently, and have tried to appeal to their supposed values by pointing out that they would be on the other side if their values were more important to them than their egos.

Frustrating.

Anyways, I've not decided if I should upload the Theoma archive to the public or not.  Right now, it's just between me and the corrupted conservatives who got on my case after I stopped being sexy for "liberals" who I think in hindsight were not actually liberals.

Draco Cretel has been showing off his ability to write about child dragons without child molestation.  Good for him, if he's actually a single person, and not (as I suspect) a collective psuedonym for a group of stalkers who hate me for rejecting the pedophile simulations they had me doing.  I'm Ihroun as one of my psuedonyms, because Ihroun expressed part of my frustration over being valued only for sex by people who acted like they were superior creatives with superior empathy even though all they wanted out of me was cybersex.

Marchosias expressed another part of that frustration (particularly as there was *no rescue for her* in a childhood scenario written to involve clear molestation), but I can't be 'Marchosias'.  I'd rather not adopt a psuedonym drawn directly from the Goetia.  I don't feel that source material gives me enough sense of what the characters *should* be... and anyways, 'Marchosias' is more someone who taught me than someone I am, because I learned such surprising things from playing that character in her own mind.

I've bought a small collection of Christian books today from a local bookstore called McDonald's Book Exchange.  The owner was working the register herself.  She complained of a lack of business and gave me an advertising flier that I've promised to post up somewhere at my college.  I don't plan to ask permission; it's a minor offense and harmless enough.  (I know it's practically littering, but I also do unpaid cleanup work in areas that I frequent.)

The store's selection is in most respects not stand-out.  It's rather a hole-in-the-wall.  Still, it saddens me to think that they cannot survive in our area.  I love that Redmond *has* a hole-in-the-wall bookshop.  I would like it to remain.

There is one sense in which the selection at McDonald's Book Exchange stands out.  For Christian books specifically they have the best selection in the area.  I don't exactly mean bibles and books about the Christian canon.  I mean books inspired by Christianity, whose authors are proud of the origin of their thought in religious contemplation and the values of religious communities.

My historic engagement with Christianity has been abstract and reclusive.  I contemplate the life of Christ on a near-daily basis, though I am not Christian I consider Christ to have been a forerunner of modern ethics from a surprisingly early point in history.  Yet I am not... actually a prolific reader.  It's strange to admit, but I'm more of a book hoarder than a reader.  My desk is cluttered with partially read books all of which I intend to finish 'eventually', and I've just added a grocery bag full of books to the backlog.  If I ever get deep into my backlog... I intend to learn more about the Christian perspective from within that perspective, as it is seen by people with the wherewithal to write books.  I respect authorship.
