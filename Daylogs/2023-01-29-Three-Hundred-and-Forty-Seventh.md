I did no writing yesterday, but spent the whole day reading "Draconic Karma Dungeon" on Royal Road.  I worry that it's a bad story, but I couldn't help studying it fascinatedly.  I feel like I've learned from it and I worry that I've underrated it.

5,158 words on the file.  5,480 words on the file.  5,805 words on the file.  647 words of progress.  File completed.

23,512 words on the file.  This is the master file with the latest file merged in.  Not sure if I'll be editing this one right now.  I'm just poking at it.  I've got 23,512 words into another manuscript...

My fully-dressed weight is recorded as 254.3 pounds.  I'm beginning a 6-day span of fasting and I want to compare this weight with my end-of-week weight.

2,689 words on the new file.  3,372 words of progress.  Not bad for a day without eating.

End of the night.  252.7 pounds.  That's one day of fasting.

Based on briefly talking to a stranger on a site for writing, I had a thought about 'charisma'.  If I were highly charismatic, I'd probably be miserable.  Why?  My talent would push me into talking with other people.  My skill with language already makes me miserable in exactly that way.  I'm an introvert whose only skill is communicating.  The mismatch between my available skill and my social inclination makes me want to eat myself to death.

I felt stressed and unable to get to bed, so I ate a sandwich.  Sugarfree marmalade, soynut butter, and two slices of keto bread.  About ten grams of carbohydrates, I think.  The worst offender was the soynut butter, which includes actual sugar.  Keeping carb loads low enough for keto dieting is astonishingly hard... though this time, I'm really just keeping my calorie count low enough.  I'm confident that it was less than the 370 calories remaining in my calorie budget for today.

Four hundred calories per day.  That's how I fasted and lost a lot of weight.  The body restrains the metabolism and desperately tries to recover lost weight, but it can't adapt to four hundred calories per day.
