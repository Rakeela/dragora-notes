Last night as I tried to lay down, there was a single honk very briefly from across the street, and an hour later there was a car that roared past on the highway laying on its horn.  I do not believe that either were coincidental.  Someone obsesses with me so foully that they know when I lay down for bed.

Meanwhile, as I've been trying to write on a story this evening, I've been getting abused by imbecilic "chewing" noises from nowhere.  My psych meds do not do enough against them.
