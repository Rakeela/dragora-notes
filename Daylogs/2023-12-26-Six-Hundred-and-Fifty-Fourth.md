11:59.  I had an idea for a new story.  It would be based on the dragons of my past life, but instead of retreating to the far north in a desperate bid to repopulate, they instead tried to engage with humans and get humans to adopt parents, increasing their reproduction rate by increasing the number of "parents" available for dragons.  They would tell humans that dragon childhood lasted thirty years.  This is shorter than the childhoods of dragons in the NCC, but it is a compromise that fits into human lifespans.

12:01.  They would tell potential adopters that dragons would pick up their first words early, and that by six months they would know their name, the names of the humans in their social proximity, and words related to their most and least favorite things.  They would then warn that young dragons would be mostly nonverbal for twenty years, during which they would probably only talk about the four categories (themselves, their social proximity, their most favorite things, and their least favorite things).  However, it was still very important to talk *at* them, and tell them about the world.  They would learn more language than they used.

12:03.  In the 20 year range, young dragons could be raised as pets-to-whom-one-talks, and maybe eventually as pets-to-whom-one-loans-books.  After twenty years, there would occur a change in the young dragon, and they would become a more lucid, conversational person.

12:05.  At this point, even if they came out with a very sophisticated vocabulary, it was important to remember that they were still a child.

12:06.  A story based on this worldbuilding would cover the life of a young dragon in a human family, with only occasional visits from other dragons.  And...  I might replace the humans with some other species.  Maybe everyone is otters instead, I dunno.  Or gryphons.  Or those raptors from that past life, they would actually be really amenable to this arrangement, but their society was a bunch of militant miners.

12:07.  It would change the entire story concept to use the raptors.  They wanted to use dragons as superior soldiers.

15:52.  74,800.  

17:32.  75,992.  1,192 words of progress.  This is kinda frustrating.  I feel like I've written a lot!  And then I kinda haven't.  I try to write 1,400 words every day.  1,667 every day during Nanowrimo.  This isn't enough.

17:34.  Where is this story even going?  I need it to come to a satisfying conclusion in the next 14,000 words.  Maybe that's why I feel like I wrote a lot.  I progressed towards the ending.  I'm in the final stretch.  I have to bring it all together now, I have to pay off everything in the story.  It's hard.

(This part added the next day.)  I turned off my treadmill, breaking its log before I'd saved how long I walked.  I also wrote a bit more:  76,025.  I'm going to ignore that extra bit and roll it into today's writing.
