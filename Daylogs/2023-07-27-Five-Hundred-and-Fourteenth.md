10:22.  Got up at about 8:04.  Something weird happened in Nationstates.  Yesterday, the daily increase of black market didn't happen on one of my nations.  The day before that, it didn't happen then either.  I didn't know that could ever happen.  One of my nations has cleared the basic standard black market increase pattern.  I knew they didn't all increase at the same rate, but...

10:54.  83,036.  Wait, I forgot to mark my starting point.  Again.  I need to stop doing that.  83,021.  I guess my changes didn't add a lot of words.  Credit 15 words writing.

10:56.  New starting point.  83,025

11:05.  83,028.  Doesn't look like a lot of progress since my last time point, but I've found a major content shortage.  A chapter that has to exist, isn't in the book yet.

11:14.  83,056.  Editing is harder than writing.  It's more difficult to make word count on already existing material.

11:50.  83,105.  Credit 80 words.  New starting point 83,103.

15:39.  I hit up the import store across town, and I bought up a bag of sweets!  I haven't added most of them to my candy vault yet.  I ate a pretty tasteless cookie, and since *every cookie in the bag* was individually wrapped (what a waste of packaging!) I decided to leave it outside at a bus stop rather than eat through the cookies myself.  Now the cookies will go to whoever notices them and realizes that individually wrapped cookies are safe to discover in the open.  <3

18:01.  Good heavens, I got distracted from my editing.  83,112.

18:04.  83,116.  Credit 13 words.  New starting point 83,098.

18:07.  83,120.  Credit 22 words.  New starting point...  83,120.  Oops.  I edited that next paragraph a little enthusiastically, and I've lost the record of how many words I added vs how many I removed.

18:17.  New starting point.  83,105.

18:21.  83,107.  Credit 4,830 words editing.  That's one chapter.  I feel like I should do more than one chapter of editing.  I have a stubborn antipathy to it right now.  I don't know why.  Maybe I should play more Cultist Simulator.  The yearning for immortality is healthy for me.

21:22.  I finished another victory in Cultist Simulator.  "Not Long, only a reflection".  Seems fitting.
