Three hundred day logs!

This is the first day after November.  I've got, uh...  3,705 words on the file.  I don't have to do that, but now it feels weird.  If I set a new, lower goal of 30k words in December, I'll only have to write 968 words per day to hit par.

4,065 words on the file.  That felt like more writing than it was.  360 words of progress, 608 words remaining.

Opened a new file.  228 words on the new file.  588 words of progress, 380 words to go.  I'm intimidated with what I've set up to happen next.  It's a descriptive task that I don't want to do.  Obviously, I'll do it.
