I fear Islam.  I don't want to talk about it right now, but I was just a moment ago writing something about it somewhere else.  I don't hate Islam, but I do fear it.  I see that as something I should be willing to admit to.  I consider it important to admit to in turn because I understand that fear lives next to hatred.  I believe that my fear is well-reasoned, but I'm aware that statement is vapid, as I certainly would believe myself well-reasoned most of the time.  These statements I cannot even call beliefs:  I hope I will always have the insight to hold only fears, and not hatreds; if and when my fears do not apply, I hope I will have the insight to put them aside.

I consider Islam an ideology.  If we dwelled in Yggdrasil, I would not fear it.  Yggdrasil has (in concept) the essential safeguards necessary for all ideologies to coexist without harm, no matter how intensely their adherents oppose each other.  We don't dwell in Yggdrasil, so I fear Islam as I fear all exclusionary ideologies.

I have said more than I wish to say, yet far from everything I could.  I will surely write about this some other day.  Yes, it is fair to call me Islamophobic.  No, that will not turn me.  Taunt me not, or I will reveal my fears with endurance and fixation, and I will do so with the will to speak to the values of those who oppose me.  For I believe that the purest way to be safe from an enemy is to persuade them...  I am not respectful *enough* to be perfect at conversions, but I know what I am attempting should I try.
