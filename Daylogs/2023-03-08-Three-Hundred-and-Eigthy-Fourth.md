Morning weigh-in:  247.5 pounds

I ate a pizza yesterday.  A ten inch deep dish alfredo sauce pizza with artichoke hearts, red onion, and garlic on it.  It was delicious.  It was more food than I'd intended to eat, because I'd intended to order an eight inch pizza, but I ate the whole thing.  That's why today's weight is way up.

I also ate some chocolates yesterday, and some more today.  I'm terminating my "fast" right now.  I can't.  My morale got so bad I was longing for death.

I'm kinda fretting about my current galciv game.  I believe the AIs run 'coerced colonization' to double their Growth rate, and the mimots have a default growth of 3x.  That gives them a breakneck colonization pace.  The supposed balancing factor is the challenge of feeding that many people, but that's no challenge at all in Galciv.  To add to this, the mimots produce ships with 75% health at 200% speed.  Their military is massive... and mine is technologically backwards.  I was counting on my diplomacy to prevent war.  I snagged the "Consensus" cultural trait that should have caused the whole galaxy to go to war against the Mimots, but I'm not sure the mimots can't take everyone.  I feel like my starbases are going to get ravaged, too.  Building up a huge number of starbases is a major investment.

The game presents a natalist dystopia with everyone exhorted to have as many kids as possible in a cluster of brittle, warlike societies where even culture is just a means of dominance and control.  Galciv 4 changed the turn time from one week to one month, which reduces but does not eliminate the bizarrely short period over which the in-game populations grow.  The mimots are the most extraordinary example of this.

I have my save game at the start of the war, and I don't really want to play it out.  I don't want to imagine all those people dying in all those starbases.  Each starbase costs 1 citizen, and my homeworld's population capacity is 9.  So each starbase represents a ninth of a world.  It's like imagining a billion people dying every time a starbase falls.  Imagining compassionate space dragons trying to convert the galaxy to their culture was much more pleasant than this.  Now, even if I were to win with minimal losses, it would reveal the violence backing the navigators' many cultural stations.

Why are strategy games so horrible?  I'm not complaining about the quality.  I just hate to imagine these warlike societies.  These fast-reproducing, extraordinarily ambitious societies pressing into each other at every opportunity...

After playing Galciv for a while, I spent the rest of the day reading.  First I caught up on No More Future, then I read A Dream of Wings and Flame.  I should link that.  [[A-Dream-of-Wings-and-Flame]].  I'm tempted to link No More Future as well, but it's...  such a whiny game.  The protagonist is just miserable and helpless in a gentle dystopia.  I feel a mixture of sympathy and envy for him.  His bad situation is better than my bad situation.

I've found something I should eat more of.  Jarlsberg cheese dip.  Mayonaisse, jarlsberg cheese, and onion.  It's palatable, especially the spicy kind that adds jalapeno.  It's not even very spicy.  The jalapeno is just an additional flavor component.  This stuff is very keto-okay.  It's almost entirely fat and protein.

I wish food labels were obligated to include calories from carbohydrates in them, but including calories from fat isn't worthless.  I can subtract fat calories to determine the obesogenic propensity of a given food... almost.  I believe insulinemia still results in storing away fat calories.

As I keep working on trying to extend my walking endurance with the goal of eventually achieving a 9 hour marathon, foot pain is my constant companion.  I need to strengthen the little muscles in my feet.

Speaking of which, my attempt to train at 2.3 mph is being sabotaged by twinges in my feet.  Kistaro always encourages me to listen to my body's signals, so I guess that means I'll slow down.  Again.  I feel like I can't keep up a decent speed long enough to get real training in.

13.6 miles, 2,019 kcal burned, 40,548 steps.  7 hours, 15 minutes, 45 seconds.  Average speed 1.9 mph.  Golly jeepers, I sure wish calories-in/calories-out were accurate.  I would be outrunning my fork.  The whole reason the saying is, "You can't outrun your fork" is because calories-in/calories-out is NOT accurate.

I stopped doing evening weigh-ins for a few days because they made me feel anorexic.  Coincidentally, my will to fast broke down around the same time.  I think I went into a rebellious state of mind.  Too much utter misery from fasting.

Evening weigh-in:  247.9 pounds
