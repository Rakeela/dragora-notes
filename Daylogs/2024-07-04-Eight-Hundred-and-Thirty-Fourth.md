19:38.  I have not been working.  I've been doing other stuff since my last timepoint, and not a lot.  Today has mostly been a day off.  I've been relaxing.  It sucked for a lot of it, but I gradually... succeeded at relaxing, and I feel pretty good now.  Still, I did a little more editing work.  Credit 300 words editing.  148,434.
