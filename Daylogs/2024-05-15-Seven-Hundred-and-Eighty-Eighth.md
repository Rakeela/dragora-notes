9:58.  42,615.

11:26.  43,387.

12:23.  43,959.  I'm a little stalled, struggling to think of the next thing to have happen in the story.

13:59.  45,103.  2,488 words of progress.  I've worked steadily for a while now, and I'm going to take a break.

15:35.  I went away, bought several books, ate a book...  Wait, no.  I bought ice cream and ate it.  Peanut butter and pistachio.  Delicious!  I did however consume one of the several books I bought, sitting in a park and reading it through.  It wasn't a long book, but it still set me back 10 USD.

18:10.  I have been unable to get back to work so far.  I spent an inordinately long time playing Nationstates today.  One of my nations magnificently increased its integrity while also increasing its business subsidization, increasing its compassion, and lowering its economic freedoms.  It's a nation so polite that the rudeness graph punishes lowering economic freedoms, but the gain in compassion achieved a reduction in rudeness greater than the increase of rudeness from socialism.

20:27.  46,183.  I did eventually get back to work.  Actually, this is a weird amount of progress.  When I said earlier, "I have been unable to get back to work so far," that can't have been true, because I then went on to play Deep Rock Galactic: Survivors with Kistaro for a while, and came back to this work being mostly done.  My self-monitoring is not ideal.  I wish I were an AI so that I could understand my own cognitive processes in greater detail.

20:29.  When I get to 1000 daylogs, I'm going to create a Daylogs 2 folder, so that each Daylogs folder contains 1000 daylogs.

20:30.  3,568 words of progress so far today.
