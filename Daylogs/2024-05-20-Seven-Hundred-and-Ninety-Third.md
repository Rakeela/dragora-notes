10:44.  53,735.  Let's see if I can keep up with my daylog this time.  I've been doing so badly lately.

10:45.  It's totally normal for me to update my exercise only the next day, but I should be on top of giving a final report on my word count.  To be honest, I've been ashamed of my lack of focus. I've been drifting in and out of my writing task.  My total productivity is fine, but I'm not... feeling like I'm mostly working.

11:50.  54,359.

12:50.  55,288.  1,553 words of progress.

20:18.  I have been away from my writing for hours, first playing a TTRPG session with my gaming group, then later playing a porn game.  I wanted to exorcise the stress I've felt today, and touch base with something that inspires hypno kink in me.  The hypno kink stuff is helpful in writing Wasteland Engineering.

20:30.  55,532.

22:10.  56,670.  2,935 words of progress.  That's probably all I'll do tonight.
