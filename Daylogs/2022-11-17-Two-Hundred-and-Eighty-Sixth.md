I ate almost no sugar yesterday.  I didn't have a low-carb day.  Just very little sugar.  It would've been no sugar at all, but there were three grams of added sugar in the can of corn that I ate.

I'm thinking that if I switch my dietary habits to eating no sugar and no meat, I should lose weight without specifically dieting.  I've bought lots of dates though, let's see if I can gain weight on dates.

I am eating a bit more sugar today, as I have cans of mustard bbq beans to eat.  They're quite distinctly sweetened.  I'm not quite willing to throw them away, but I'm willing to never buy them again when I've eaten through them.

I'm getting a late start today at writing.  The file is at 6,382 words.  I could split this into multiple scenes, and when I edit this material I will certainly do so.  For now though, the scene is "Eighth Wrimo Scene".

7,191 words.  I think this is the end of this file.  809 words of progress, 858 words to go.  Almost halfway there!

A random 1 appeared in my file while I was looking at another window.  I'm suspicious about that.  Anyways, the tally at the point where it happened was 309 words.  That's 1,118 words of progress, with 549 words to go.

947 words.  1,756 words of progress, 89 words over quota.  I'm having trouble today and I'm just going to report this for the moment.  Maybe I'll do more in a bit.

I played a bit of Age of Wonders: Planetfall.  I played until I grew discontented.  What good is progress in a game?  I would rather progress in my stories.  Even if I am unhappy with the quality of my current writing, practicing will improve my skill.  I am not afraid of self-repetition.
