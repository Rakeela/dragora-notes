Every day brings new challenges.  Today's challenge is that I'm completely exhausted and I have been for most of the day.  It's 13:32 and I haven't been alert since a brief window from about 9:00 to 10:00 when I felt just fine.  I've spent a fair while on the couch.  My eyes hurt, though they're not bloodshot.  I drank two energy drinks this morning.  I'm tempted to drink another one.  Anything to feel like I'm doing something to feel better.

My weight has gotten under 240 again.  I'm nearing the midpoint of my 252 hour "fast".  This added discipline during the transition from the 240s to the 230s should reinforce my ability to actually stay in the 230s range.

Drinking another energy drink made me feel more energetic!  I got to try a flavor I've never had before, too.  I think it's amazing the way new flavors appear every time I attempt a prolonged fast.  It's almost like a spiritual experience for me as a glutton.  If I eat regularly, I eat the same stuff all the time.  If I fast for at least four days, there's something new every time, and usually several new things.  It makes me feel like the cosmos loves me and tolerates my gluttony as long as I check it.

The new flavor of energy drink was SO new, it didn't scan correctly at the register.  That was funny.  The check-out stand didn't recognize the can.  I think this is the second time that it's happened that I've seen something new in the grocery store while fasting, taken it to the checkout, and discovered that it didn't scan.

Unfortunately, the new energy drink didn't make me feel focused.  At all.  I'm sort of scrambled.  I've been studying the Stellaris wiki, something I absolutely do not need to do.  I'm not even reading Hidden Worldviews... much.  I read a few pages of the Relativism section.  It's not as atrocious as the individualism section so far.

I've been bleakly depressed today.  I laid on the couch again for a while, thinking about how I couldn't do anything.

I'm examining the long-saved tabs in my browser.  I've cleared a few.  Links that I'd saved for a long time.  Two categories are gone.  One category is significantly trimmed.
