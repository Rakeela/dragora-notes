8:44.  42,546.

9:33.  42,612.  I've gotten distracted by TTRPG stuff, and I think I should lean into it, since there's something TTRPG-related that I need to have done by next Thursday.

13:23.  I'm finally dragging myself out of TTRPG stuff.

14:54.  Okay!  Finally trying to get back to writing.

16:43.  43,091.  Oh, god.  Progress is going so slowly.  This had better pick up, or my word count today is going to suck.

20:19.  44,658.  2,112 words of progress.

22:05.  45,460.  2,914 words of progress.  I don't think I can do any more tonight.

22:36.  I am suffering a mad craving for cookies, mixed with a discontent at my word count.  2,914 words!  Why did I not write more?  I spent all day today working at creative endeavors.
