14:10.  I've been completely fixated on Hc Svnt Dracones so far today.

14:12.  58,921.  I've been failing my quota lately, let's see if I succeed it today.

14:33.  59,063.  I wrote a little bit and got distracted.  Grah.  I'm unfocused.

14:55.  59,612.  I feel like I've written to the limit of what I currently have prepared.  I only have the vaguest idea of what happens next.

15:17.  60,034.  1,113 words of progress.  I kicked the can a little bit and raised my word count, but I still don't know how to get from Point A to Point Plot.  1,747 words on the chapter.  It's not ready to end yet.

15:37.  60,158.  I haven't hit quota and the chapter doesn't feel complete, but I don't know what to add to it!  It needs another scene and I have zero ideas.

16:03.  I took a bit of a break from writing, but I still have...  null inspiration.  I've put up a *big no* in the story that is just begging to be violated.

16:57.  I read a Hc Svnt Dracones contract, hoping for inspiration.  Well, I read the contract, at least.  Null inspiration.

19:18.  I let myself focus on Hc Svnt Dracones, without yield for my writing, but briefly talking about it with Kistaro made me realize that Kura needs to be in contact with the other gryphons in Miv's Mine, especially Nevein.

(This part added the next day.)  11.6 miles.  2,100 kcal.  42,731 steps.  9 hours, 37 minutes, and 58 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.  Such a shame that Energy In Energy Out isn't how the metabolism actually works, because 2k walking would make dieting so much easier if the EIEO model was accurate.
