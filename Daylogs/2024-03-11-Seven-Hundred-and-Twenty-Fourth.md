8:49.  18,641.

9:27.  18,643.  I made a small tweak and then got distracted studying hydrogeology to determine the water available to the arid Kingdom of Verdin, east of the mountains in the Torvui interior.  Now I feel a need for a context reset, so I'm going to play Nationstates.

12:04.  Ugh.  I haven't been able to get back to work.  I feel sick and tired.  The "smart dogs" I had for breakfast don't seem to have sat well with me.

12:05.  It's strange how much I want to react to feeling unwell by eating.  Feel good?  Eat.  Feel bad?  Eat.  The only time I don't want to eat is when I feel very overfull.  Note 'very', just feeling ordinary overfull still leaves me wanting food.  Which is where I am right now, even though I'm fully cognizant that eating something would only make me feel worse.  Not overfull, mind you.  Just wanting food.

14:25.  19,661.

21:33.  22,792.  4,151 words of progress.
