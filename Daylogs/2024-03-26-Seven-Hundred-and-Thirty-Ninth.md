11:44.  73,496.  I feel pretty bleh, but work is an everyday thing.

11:51.  73,494.  New rebase, ignore the number above this one.

14:02.  74,333.  839 words of progress.

14:43.  74,860.  1,366 words of progress.

15:02.  74,880.  1,386 words of progress.  Stalled.  Haven't even hit 1,400 yet.

15:10.  Ugh, I am exhausted.

15:14.  I can't get anything done right now.

16:16.  I took a break.

16:23.  74,961.  In a dream I had once, one of the characters in the dream said something irritating to me once, asking whether a day on which I ate twice was a day on which I fasted.  At the time, I took it as a kind of mockery aimed at the difficulty that I have fasting, and perhaps it was, but I'm thinking about it today, because a new interpretation has occurred to me.  If I eat a small amount of food, I feel better for quite some time, sort of.  I feel better in some ways, but also hungrier.  Eating a little badly makes me want to eat a lot.  If I actually had days in which I ate twice, and it was a small amount of food on both occasions, I would likely lose weight.

16:34.  Wow, I am not getting much done.  I'm just so discontented that I can't focus.  I'm unhappy.  I'm distracted by a sort of repeated return to discomfort.

16:35.  I thought putting the treadmill away and sitting down would help.  It did not.  Drinking a third energy drink didn't help either.

17:59.  I got distracted studying a book that I read recently.  It has such emotionally valid characters.  I love their stories.

20:12.  76,219.  I haven't been focused at all, I think.  2,723 words of progress.

23:16.  76,898.  3,404 words of progress.  I had an unproductive period earlier, but I just kept going back to it.  And...  I wasn't very quick at writing, but I kept trying.

23:29.  76,901.  3,407 words of progress.
