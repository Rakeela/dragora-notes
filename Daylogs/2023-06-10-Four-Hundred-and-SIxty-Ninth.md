6:06.

6:09.  Sorry about the blank timepoint.  I didn't know what to say.  Normally I shift back timepoints rather than post them blank, but this was the first one of the day and signaled the point at which I opened my day logger.

8:50.  I am really hungry, but I'm not eating until late this evening.

9:45.  Just realized I forgot to write my starting word count.  73,241.  I'm currently at 74,005.  761 words on the chapter.

10:44.  74,939.  1,695 words on the chapter.

18:30.  Not a highly productive day.  I did want to record a thought that occurred to me.  The partisan divide between liberals and conservatives has been especially bitter in recent years.  I think liberalism got influenced by creepy stalker inclinations some years ago and it did itself some damage by not being very liberal, but more recently it seems like the pendulum has swung and now conservatives are the ones being evil.  It shouldn't be obscure why it's wrong to require entire demographics to prove they aren't trying to get children molested.

19:38.  I'm going to stop buying the red velvet chocolate chunk cookies.  They're such a temptation to eat in large quantities.
