14:46.  Gluttony and sloth are my sins.  I'm trying to cope with gluttony lately.  I think, if I live long enough, I'll have a handle on it.

15:00.  That said, I've eaten too much today, and when I eat too much I swear time moves a bit faster.  Hardly felt like any time passed since I made that comment before.  Oog.

21:56.  I've just been eating sweets freely again.  Sigh.  There's no equivalent to vegetarianism for someone who just doesn't eat sweets.  There's no built up ideology against sweets.
