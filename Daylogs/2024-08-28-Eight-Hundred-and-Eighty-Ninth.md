10:10.  74,772.  74,837.  I forgot to mark my starting point.

14:19.  75,414.  I thought I'd written more.  A lot more.  I guess I haven't been focused today.  I wrote some good rhetoric on 4chan though.  I made the point of the mendacity of evil a few times.

14:48.  75,595.  I have a new favorite pizza.  Thick crust, red sauce, spinach, mozzarella, red onion, black olives, and roasted garlic.

18:54.  79,795.  5,023 words of progress.  That's a productive day.  I've been running too long.  Maybe I should stop and do something else.

20:39.  I eventually came back to writing.  Gaming bored me!  The Ascent was a crude, dumb game that didn't inspire me in any useful way.  80,373.

21:54.  80,853.  I am just writing *whatever* for this story.  6,081 words of progress.

22:33.  81,321.  6,549 words of progress.

(This part added the next day.)  Oops!  I forgot to record my treadmill duration, and the treadmill turned off when I rolled it away.  I remember that I stopped at about 8 hours, 53 minutes, having gone at 1.2 mph, thus it would report that I was moving at an average speed of 1.1 mph.
