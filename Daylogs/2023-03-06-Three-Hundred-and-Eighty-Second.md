Morning weigh-in:  245.2 pounds

---
2,201 words on the file.  2,514 words on the file.  313 words of progress.  Completed a chapter.  This next one is hard to start on, but it isn't even noon yet.  I think today will be a good day for writing.

I had a plan to eat something today.  I wasn't hungry until I started to act on that plan.  Then, hunger surged forward.  I wonder, now.  Is the hunger induced by sweets the result of "acting on the plan of eating"?  Have people typically failed to resist the sweets before they are conscious of the temptation?

I have a drawer full of sweets behind me all the time as I work out.  I have gotten used to ignoring it.

---
Despite my earlier mention of ignoring sweets, I'm adding a cookie to my day.  No, I'm not going to end my fasting tracker, or otherwise account for it.  Other things have gone wrong that will never be accounted for, and my quality of life is reduced for reasons that I will never have compensated.  I'm having a cookie.

Not that I feel especially satisfied by it.  I feel death-seeky today.  My will to live is kinda poor right now.  I'm a pacifist, so it's not like I'll do anything horrific, but I could definitely eat more.  It's not like I'd even regret it.  I don't tend to regret eating.  I appreciate it, even though I suffer for it.  I'll definitely can my current fast if I eat more than I have.  If I just eat an extra cookie, I haven't done too badly.  Weighing myself, I currently weigh 244.5 pounds, so obviously I'm just passively shedding glycogen weight by walking and not eating (much).

I played a bit more galciv today.  I stopped before long, suffering from dissatisfaction.  I don't feel like I grasp the strategies in the game.  I'm just passively building up for the whole duration of the game.  I won the last game by building a bunch of culture bases.  The coolest thing I did was to colonize and make influential a minor world in a new sector.  It started out level 1, but I fed it chimeric biomass.  I ended up with two sectors dominated.

I tried a short stint on the treadmill at 3.0 mph.  That raises a sweat.  I'm getting overexercise injuries from low speeds for long durations.  How long is it going to take me to get to 3 mph for 9 hours straight?  Because that's the pricetag of the 9 hour marathon.  3 miles per hour... for 9 hours straight.

Kistaro thinks I'll be able to do it in two months.  I think I'll lack the courage.  I have to push myself for literal hours.

---
Have to stop exercise early tonight.  Kistaro wants to lubricate the belt and clean the motor.  It needs to cool down first.  10.2 miles, 1,638 kcal, 32,972 steps, 6 hours, 32 minutes, 51 seconds.  Average speed 1.5 mph.

It's really hard not to eat more.  See, I'm a reincarnate with past life memories...  I didn't ask for that.  It's just true.  I'm secular.  I was an atheist in my past life... and in the life before it, which I also remember... and I'm still an atheist in this life.  But I've been around in a way that 'shouldn't' be possible.

And I hate this life.

If I work hard, I get to suffer a lot and live a few more years of suffering.  If I just eat more, I get to die faster and go to a different life.

I expect death to shatter my memories and leave me clinging to tatters of identity again.  That's what it's been like every time so far.  I HATE death.  It's a horribly traumatic experience that destroys so much every time.  I don't feel reassured by past life memories.  They fill me with a helpless anger at something unchallengeable.

This world *could* challenge death.  It's within the scope of human technological potentials to master biology and cognition such that people live forever in any of several forms.  So I should want to live as long as possible here!  Except something fucks with me.  Several things have fucked with me and at least one is still doing it.  My rights were profoundly violated in several ways that will never be acknowledged.  So do I *want* to live forever in this world, knowing I'll be fucked with forever?  Or would I rather be shattered by death again?
