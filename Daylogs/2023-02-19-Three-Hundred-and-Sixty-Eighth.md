Oops.  I accidentally double-tapped on the pause session button on my treadmill, ending tracking early.  I walked 3,289 steps, crossing 0.8 miles, burning 162 kcal, traveled at an estimated 1.1 mph, and walked for 44 minutes and 55 seconds.

3,886 words on the file.  5,459 words on the file.  File completed.  1,573 words of progress.

1,830 words on the new file.  It's late and I'm dry of inspiration.  I think that's enough.  3,403 words of progress today.

I walked an additional 5.3 miles, but instead of going to summary mode when I hit the pause button a second time, it turned off.  So I didn't get the step-count, kcal estimate, or exact duration of walking recorded.  I'd been going at 1.2 mph for a bunch of it, then 1.3 mph for a bunch of it, so...  Eh.  It was over four hours of additional walking.  I'll estimate that I walked for five hours today.  Thank goodness my foot has healed.
