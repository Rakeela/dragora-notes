9:12.  I woke up at 7:10 due to disturbing dreams.  I think I dreamed about explorers going to a dangerous place where they were required to obey the dictates of strange entities that could easily kill them.  The explorers went there willingly, but I can no longer remember why.  I was one of them, but I don't know what I was trying to acquire or accomplish.  I remember thinking that it was "an ultimate lawfulness challenge", because the rules were rarely hidden, just convoluted and specific.

9:23.  92,177 words on the file.  Let's see how much I can trim this file today.  Quality is job #1, of course.  I remove some things and I add others.

9:52.  2,901 words reviewed.  92,102 words on the file.  75 words removed.  A bit less than 3% of the reviewed words were trimmed off.  Hm.  There are 77,481 words remaining in the file.  If I trim 3% of the remainder, I'll trim 2,324 words.  That will get me to my target.  This seems very doable.

10:53.  I have to mark that I reviewed another 410 words.  This was deep in the book, so I'm just noting it for my records.  I won't update my word count yet.

11:05.  4,496 words reviewed.  This is additive, not cumulative; I need to sum these review chunks up when I'm done.  91,871 words on the file.  306 words removed, cumulatively.  Perhaps I can get to 500 words removed today.

11:37.  4,477 words reviewed.  91,786 words on the file.  391 words removed.

11:56.  76 words reviewed.  No, that's not all I've reviewed since the last timepoint, but I reviewed a segment deep in the book and had to separately record it.

12:00.  3,788 words reviewed.  91,789 words on the file.  388 words removed.  Quality is job one.    I saw more that needed to be added than I saw of things that needed to be taken away, so this review pass didn't add brevity.

12:27.  4,335 words reviewed.  91,792 words on the file.  385 words removed.  I excused this as "quality is job one" before, but now I'm getting frustrated.  I'm not doing good at changing the material.  I'm mostly reading it without changing it.

12:47.  Tallying up the reviewing I did so far, I get 20,483.  I'm confident that there's 500 words to remove across the whole thing, but I need to trim harder to reach my goal.  There's an editing tracker that I use with friends.  I feel guilty listing the whole 20,483 word tally when I feel like I didn't do the editing very well.  I need to get away from my computer for a bit.  I've exhausted my "Decadent Smores" cookies and now I think I should get more "Decadent Red Velvet Chocolate Chunk" cookies.  On the other hand, I still have more "Kimberley Spring Frosted Sugar Cookies" to eat.  They're past their sell-by date, but they don't seem stale to me.  I haven't opened them yet, but I also have the two shortbread packages that are even farther past their sell-by date.

12:53.  I feel a greater sense of hoard-loss when I eat my candies and chocolates than when I eat cookies.  Cookies feel temporary and difficult to hoard.  That leads me to prefer to eat the cookies from my candy vault rather than the eponymous candies.  The only cookies that feel fully hoardable are the distinctly substandard Oreos.

13:25.  I got an excellent deal on some endangered species chocolate!  This is a wonderful addition to my hoard.  I also picked up a novel variety of keto protein bar, even though I didn't get a good deal at all for it.  I decided against buy more cookies.  I still have sugar cookies and shortbread to eat.

13:36.  91,794 words on the file.  383 words removed.  Hmf.

13:37.  91,791 words on the file.  386 words removed.  It's a struggle to find more to remove from the material I'm working on.  It's already reasonably brief.  The words present are evocative and need to remain.  That's how they strike me, at least.  I wonder how my pre-readers will react to these chapters.'

13:39.  91,788 words on the file.  389 words removed.  I'm finding more!

13:41.  91,787 words on the file.  390 words removed.

13:42.  91,780 words on the file.  397 words removed.  Found a cluster!

13:43.  91,778 words on the file.  399 words removed.

13:44.  91,773 words on the file.  404 words removed.  Every word feels like a struggle.

13:48.  91,771 words on the file.  406 words removed.  I added a few this time, but I removed slightly more than I added.

13:55.  91,763 words on the file.  414 words removed.  Maybe I can get to 500 today.

13:57.  91,744 words on the file.  433 words removed.  I found an awkward phrase and smashed it.

14:00.  91,722 words on the file.  455 words removed.  That was a bigger edit than I thought it was.  Every little edit adds up, too.  I'm creeping up on my goal for the day.  Then I think I'll play Stellaris.

14:01.  91,726 words on the file.  451 words removed.  I found something that could stand to be more evocative, so I added a few words.

14:03.  91,733 words on the file.  444 words removed.  Changes knocking on from the prior change.

14:06.  91,741 words on the file.  436 words removed.  I found something slightly loreful to add.

14:07.  91,737 words on the file.  440 words removed.

14:10.  91,731 words on the file.  446 words removed.  Changed something to be briefer.

14:12.  91,716 words on the file.  461 words removed.  Mild rewrite to a paragraph.

14:14.  91,710 words on the file.  467 words removed.  I found a lore error and cut it.

14:15.  91,703 words on the file.  474 words removed.  I deemed a detail extraneous.

14:18.  91,687 words on the file.  490 words removed.  One of Ekis' lines was wordy.  I shortened it.

14:19.  91,673 words on the file.  504 words removed.  Some of the words were totally unnecessary.

14:22.  91,673 words on the file.  I changed two descriptions.  No net change to the wordage.

14:23.  91,670 words on the file.  507 words removed.  I splatted an "and" by separating two sentences, and then I took away a "seemed to be" that was just inappropriate.  It was about something visibly obvious.  Why was I introducing uncertainty there?

14:24.  91,662 words on the file.  515 words removed.  I got rid of some inappropriate, contradictory description, while replacing a description that bugged me with one that was more fun, energetic, and brief.

14:26.  91,655 words on the file.  522 words removed.  Slightly confusing extension of a sentence smashed! - tally

14:29.  91,652 words on the file.  525 words removed.  I caught Ekis thinking about something she shouldn't know about yet.

14:31.  91,685 words on the file.  492 words removed.  I found something characterful to add.  It was wordier than I expected.

14:32.  91,660 words on the file.  517 words removed.  I trimmed the paragraph with the wordy addition.

14:34.  91,658 words on the file.  519 words removed.  I improved a description.  It got very slightly shorter in the process.

14:36.  91,636 words on the file.  541 words removed.  I improved something that bugged me, then splatted an unnecessary (redundant) bit of lore.  The result is a little more like something someone would say excitedly.

14:38.  91,633 words on the file.  544 words removed.  I destroyed an unnecessary de-intensifier.  "Just" and "a bit" get scrubbed during close editing.  They're usually not necessary.

14:41.  91,633 words on the file.  I had described fried fish as having a buttery texture.  Hm.  Corrected to "flaky".  Buttery textured meat sounds wrong.  I'm going to hop back to my second draft and correct this there, too.  No reason to subject my pre-readers to a bizarre imaginary dish.

14:43.  91,628 words on the file.  549 words removed.  I tightened up one description and clarified another, removing words both times.

14:45.  91,632 words on the file.  545 words removed.  I added a characterful action tag to a statement.  Net increase in word count.

14:47.  91,632 words on the file.  Taking a risk with a "more draconic" description on something.  It doesn't seem ideal to me, but it's more unusual.  No net change in the word count.

14:52.  91,667 words on the file.  510 words removed.  I noticed an absence that the characters would have noticed, and I filled the gap.  Now they notice what they should notice.  There's now a very oblique reference to myrghon having no excretory functions, a canonical fact in Theoma.  Myrskor likewise have no excretory functions.

14:54.  91,663 words on the file.  514 words removed.  I found an entire four word sentence that could be removed from a piece of dialogue without affecting its meaning.

14:56.  91,661 words on the file.  516 words removed.  I made a description more special to the myrghon while reducing word count by two words, yay!

14:57.  91,659 words on the file.  518 words removed.  I took a speech disfluency out of a piece of dialogue.  I mean, it wasn't really a speech disfluency, but it messed up the flow of the sentence.  It'd trip up a voice actor, so out it goes.  There's a bit of redundant lore here as well, but I'm less comfortable removing it because it's natural in the conversation.

15:04.  91,699 words on the file.  478 words removed.  I added something to the epilogue.

15:06.  91,702 words on the file.  475 words removed.  I improved the bit I added to the epilogue, but it got slightly longer.  I should add 38 and 35 words written to today's work tally for new segments I've written today.  73 words.

15:09.  91,699 words on the file.  478 words removed.  A sentence suggested an unnecessary meeting should occur.  I trimmed it back to what's actually necessary.

15:12.  91,691 words on the file.  486 words removed.  Trimmed a wordy description.

15:13.  91,690 words on the file.  487 words removed.  Every word of quality brevity is a triumph.

15:14.  91,685 words on the file.  492 words removed.  Redundancy eliminated.

15:16.  91,683 words on the file.  494 words removed.  I just hit the end of the section that I was working over.  I removed more than 500 words in the first 20k words of the book.  I still have 1,683 words to remove in order to reach my target word count, but I'm actually fairly satisfied.  I feel like I'm close enough to 90k.  Of course, that won't stop me from reaching for additional brevity as I go.  I wonder if I should continue work.  I have been at this since 9:23.  That's only six hours, though.  A workday is eight hours, right?

15:28.  91,680 words on the file.  497 words removed.  I took a brief break and then came back to the work.  I'm returning to an earlier stretch of the book for another close pass.

15:30.  91,672 words on the file.  505 words removed.  I nixed a phrase that sounded nice, but wasn't strictly necessary.  I don't like to do that.  It might be bad brevity.

15:32.  91,665 words on the file.  512 words removed.  I destroyed a mostly harmless phrase.  This change makes little difference in the moment, but if allowed to be numerous across the entire book, all those mostly harmless phrases would add up to some harm.

15:34.  91,664 words on the file.  513 words removed.  I retuned one of my favorite paragraphs.  Slight additions, slight subtractions.  One word of net change.

15:36.  91,660 words on the file.  517 words removed.  Brevity in dialogue.  This always has to be weighed against the question of what the character would really say, but I have to try to hit my word count target...

15:38.  91,651 words on the file.  526 words removed.  Was that really a nine word alteration?  I'm surprised.

15:40.  91,646 words on the file.  531 words removed.  Close reading like this really shows me things about the writing.  There's a line that I've left in which I think might be unreasonable.  Nobody would pull out of the caravan over being accompanied by an unpleasant individual for a single day...

15:43.  91,651 words on the file.  526 words removed.  Found a description that could be a little more detailed.

15:44.  91,627 words on the file.  550 words removed.  Found a bit of arguably redundant lore.  I'm not sure it's redundant, but I think it's also arguably unnecessary.  I'm not sure it's unnecessary, but I'm sure it's out of the draft.

15:47.  91,611 words on the file.  566 words removed.  I found a straight-up contradiction to smash down.  Take that!

15:49.  91,604 words on the file.  573 words removed.  I found another error and fixed it.  I had to rewrite a bit of dialogue and the rewritten dialogue is shorter.

15:51.  91,595 words on the file.  582 words removed.  Redundant lore trimmed.

15:55.  91,592 words on the file.  585 words removed.  One of the descriptions was a little too long.  I rearranged it to preserve detail with slightly fewer words.

16:01.  I've worked over the first 20k words pretty thoroughly and I've met my 500 word quota.  I think I'm going to call this 'done' for the day.  I've worked the third draft over across the first 8 chapters.  Tomorrow, I should start on chapter 9.

16:03.  Oops.  My arithmetic must have misled me at some point.  92,177 - 92,592 = 585.  So my actual result is 585 words removed.  Somewhere in this document is the record of my shameful math error.

16:13.  There's no more record of a math error in the document; I've gone back and retroactively fixed all the tallies.  I messed up by 10 words at one point and 20 words at another point, for a cumulative error understating today's trimming by 30 words.

16:14.  In summation, today I reviewed 20,483 words and I wrote 73 words.

20:14.  I played Stellaris for most of four hours, then I went to the store to look at food.  I didn't buy anything this time.  I just looked.  My [[Candy-Vault]] is well-stocked.  Even the stuff I wasn't sure I'd had before didn't have much pull on me this time.  As for Stellaris...  Ugh.  It's so slow.  I have twenty five in-game years left before it gives me the achievement for winning the game.  I think I played for five in-game years in most of four hours.  It's going to take me at least four more sessions to get that achievement and there's very little left to do in-game.  I'm just growing my society that has taken over most of that galaxy.

20:41.  Just spent a while talking with Kistaro.  Mostly about stuff related to my diet.  I've been losing weight, and for the first time ever, I'm coming off a period of caloric restriction without feeling a really urgent need to eat.  Building my candy vault seems like magic here.  I constantly feel like I have enough sweets.  Kistaro says that it reinforces a feeling of abundance.  What I notice is that good health is expensive...  if this is what I needed, it's got a pricetag on it.

20:42.  Tequila and orange soda conceals the tequila's flavor.  It's not a flattering combination.  It's just a nullifying one.  I can still taste the alcohol, but it's subtle rather than overt.

22:40.  I have a dragon book titled "The Wearle" that is taking up real estate on my desk.  It disappoints me.
