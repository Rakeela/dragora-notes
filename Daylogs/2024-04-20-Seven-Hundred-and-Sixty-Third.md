WOW!  Yesterday was SO FUN.  I was actually going to work when I set that timepoint around 11:41, but then I got distracted, and what a day it turned out to be.  I watched two movies, I played Liberal Crime Squad, and a friend gave me a gift of a game!  A GAME THAT THEY MADE.  OMG.  It was made just for me!
