8:08.

12:37.  Getting up early does no good if I don't get to work in a timely manner.  5,272.

12:57.  5,420.  2,848 on the chapter.  I'm not targeting a specific chapter tally, I just wanted to check.

13:37.  5,646.  It's so hard to progress in Theoma because I have to make constant decisions about how to present the world.  I have to do that in Tekhnevia as well, but...  I guess I feel freer to make bad decisions in Tekhnevia, because it's kind of a bad world.  Theoma is supposed to be a really good world.  So right now, I'm stalling over a temple in Theoma, because it's a huge worldbuilding opportunity, and I don't want to get it wrong.

14:13.  I am getting off on the deviancy of being supposedly dieting while actually eating a bunch of cookies.  I need to completely stop buying red velvet cookies.  It's time to go back to cheese dieting... once I finish these red velvet cookies.

16:19.  8,080.  2,660 words of progress.  5,508 words on the chapter.

16:40.  8,489.  55 words on the chapter.  3,069 words of progress.

17:26.  I think I'm done for the evening.  I'm pretty demoralized.

19:50.  Kura and Kaire is darker writing that approaches my inner demons more.  That's probably why it's fascinating.  Theoma is hard light.  It's focused on the best and brightest natures, and I have to approach something that's *scarce* in me to write them.  That might be why I feel so good about creating them, but it's probably also why they suck.

20:07.  I need to taboo cookies.  I have so many cookies in my hoard.  They're so much more tempting than other kinds of sweet.  I want my chocolate bars, but I want to gorge on cookies.  They're kind of... tempting yet unsatisfying.  I never have enough cookies until I've had too many cookies.  This is something I discovered years ago about Oreos, which maintained for years my opposition to buying Oreos, until I decided they were hoardable novelties again.  Now I've got a bunch of Oreos and I just know they're going to be "tempting yet unsatisfying" all over again.  I'm always going to be a little bit like, "Do I want to glut myself on this or throw it out?"  They're kinda low quality.  The best cookies - those decadent red velvet cookies that I've sworn not to buy again - were almost satisfying in one cookie, but there as well the temptation to glut myself persisted.

20:11.  If I can taboo cookies again, can I eventually taboo all my sweets?  Can I get to the point of considering them all tempting, but unsatisfying?  Are they truly what I want?

20:13.  I have a "hall of fame" listing of exceptionally pleasurable sweets.  I really appreciated those sweets.  Those would be the hardest to taboo.  Contrariwise, I have a "hall of shame" listing of disappointing sweets.  Those are the ones that are already taboo.  I won't buy them again.  This task of candy vaulting is kind of a quest to fill out the "hall of shame"...

21:14.  9,302 on the file.  868 on the chapter.  3,882 words of progress.

22:36.  10,555.  2,120 on the chapter.  5,135 words of progress.  Maybe I should stop for the night?

22:53.  10,630.  5,210 words of progress.  Hm.  I'm poking at it and not making much more progress.

22:56.  10,631.  5,211 words of progress.  I caught an error.  But really, I think I'm done for the night.

23:07.  1 miles.  163 kcal.  3,326 steps.  38 minutes, 20 seconds.
