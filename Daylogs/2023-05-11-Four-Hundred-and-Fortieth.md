#2023-05-11-Four-Hundred-and-Fortieth

11:24.  80,480 words on the file.  1,400 to go!  I woke up at 6:30 this morning, unable to keep sleeping, but I was still sleepy.  I was useless and dozing for hours as I tried to make up for bad sleep last night, but I did move forward working with an artist on a commission for an advertisement for The Tachanigh-Kelkaith.  The total price of the advertisement looks like it will be 347 dollars.  The advertisement will run for 2 million impressions and it will have to achieve about 109 sales to break even.

13:15.  81,651 words on the file.  1,171 words of progress.

13:36.  Tequila and Fresca works much better than tequila and cola.  I guess it's true that tequila is a fruity flavour.

13:47.  82,215 words on the file.  1,735 words of progress.  That's today's writing done, unless I do extra.

14:01.  Now what?  I don't know what to do next.  In writing or not in writing.  Cassette Beasts isn't impressive.  Stellaris isn't impressive.  I kinda want that new Stellaris DLC, but at the same time I don't want to pay for something that displeased me.

14:09.  Every time I pee, my weight hits a new recent low.  Eating a cookie every morning is perceptibly slowing my weight loss, but it's still happening.

14:54.  I left my phone at the store earlier today when I went to the pharmacy, but they kept it there, and I recovered it straightforwardly.  While I was out, I visited the British import store and bought two containers of foreign cookies as well as one box of Butlers Dark Chocolates.  That's thirteen pieces, so I recorded it in my [[Candy-Vault]] as 13x.  My new acquisitions are near or past their best-by dates, so I ought to prioritize them... once I'm no longer "fasting".

15:08.  It's been days since I had a bowel movement and I'm getting worried.  I'm going to down a bar of Lily's sugar-free chocolate and see if that shakes anything loose tonight.

15:16.  I kinda hate excretory functions.  Being a machine would be much less disgusting.

15:28.  I am 169 hours and 50 minutes into a planned 300 hour "fast".  I don't actually fast.  I just eat lightly while on a timer.  The theory is that I can then eat heavily between the end point of one timer and the start point of the next.  Much of the weight that I have lost has been lost while doing this.  Eating a cookie and a sugar-free chocolate bar is bending the rules.  This is eating a bit too much.  Bending the rules always seriously tempts me to stop the timer.  Either out of a sense of integrity (because the timer isn't valid anymore), or worse, out of a longing to eat much more.  Any excuse to stop the timer is tempting.  Right now I want to eat more.  The disruption to my excretory functions makes me feel like something has gone wrong with this period of light eating, and something having gone wrong feels like an excuse to call it dangerous to continue.  I'm planning to keep the timer running.  My weight is hovering just above 233 pounds, and I want to see how far it will drop if I keep going the other 130 hours.

16:42.  Yes!  232.4 pounds.  Much better.  I'm glad I didn't break my fast.  Something I learned these last few days: if you're eating and drinking, but you're not gaining weight, you're actually losing weight.

18:42.  I just read most of "Familiars of Terra", an animal-lovers roleplaying game from "Angry Hamster Publishing".  I think it needed another editing pass.  It has too many errors.  There's also something memorable from it which pains me, a description of an electric "pika-kin".  I felt like the cultures weren't great either, though it's hard to elucidate my discomforts.  The game also specifies that dragons used to exist, but are extinct.  That hurts.  The game book is okay I guess.

18:48.  Checking the timestamps, I just realized that I read most of a book in two hours.

19:12.  I'm tired, and struggling to want to do anything but eat.  I don't even want to eat very much.  My hunger fades in the evening.  It's just the only functioning desire right now.  Since the prior timestamp, I read a chapter of a story on Royal Road, but then I laid on the couch.

19:16.  I just discovered I forgot my afternoon gabapentin today.  That may have done bad things to my mood and energy levels.

19:17.  For some reason, even though my hunger is weakest in the evenings, my sense of taste is most acute in the evenings.  Conversely, I am hungriest in the mornings, but generally things don't taste as good then.  This is a daily cycle that mystifies me.  It is said that hunger is the best seasoning, but in my case I must hold this against the time of day.

19:21.  I read a book, but that only took two hours.  The other half of the five hours since 14:01 passed in a haze of not knowing what to do with myself.  Am I still depressed?  Is it normal to have, like, no driving desires?
