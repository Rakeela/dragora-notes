10:02.  I have decided to play a bit of No Man's Sky before starting work.

13:17.  I did that for a while, then I went out to the store and bought more salad.  And more doughnuts.  I've been eating doughnuts lately!  It's terrible.  I need to stop.  Salads leave me immensely craving carbohydrates.

13:18.  36,160.

14:43.  36,897.  This isn't coming out right.  There's a conversation that I want the characters to have, but they're not having it.

15:24.  I've done my first stupid thing in Permadeath No Man's Sky - maybe my second stupid thing, after the first time where I grabbed a gravitino ball.  I landed on a corrupted planet.  It's so... exciting!  It's nerve-wracking.  I could lose all my progress.  The risk feels intense!  Hopefully also, the risk has shaken free my fixation on what I was doing before.

17:39.  37,577.  1,417.  I'm going to play a bit more No Man's Sky.

23:30.  I didn't come back until...  fifteen minutes ago?  

23:49.  37,850.  1,690 words.
