I got to have that beer.  Alcohol is a pleasant feeling.  A single Steel Reserve doesn't seem to overrun my tolerance too much despite my general abstinence from alcohol.  It was, as expected, entirely delicious.

I want a narcoalgorithm alcohol.  I don't want the literal, liver-burning substance.  I want to be an upload entity drinking fake narcoalgorithmic booze.  I want the good of alcohol without the bad of alcohol.  There IS good of alcohol.  I want it stabilized and made available as a steady state.  If I ever have a future where I'm a municipal AI safeguarding some petty corner of infrastructure from an uploaded perch, I may also be a tipsy AI having an absolute blast under the influence of narcoalgorithms while spending my spare cycles writing stories nobody reads.
