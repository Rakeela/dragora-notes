11:32.  

13:33.  I worked on a different writing project for a while, then I got distracted with Nationstates and then a webcomic whose archive I reread some of.  One of the characters in 'The Long Hike' was there from very early on!  The cast has shifted so much over time, and they've even all been hit by a transformation, so I didn't realize it had retained a face from the early comic.

13:35.  31,323.

19:23.  32,800.  1,477 words.  That's embarrassing.  I did watch Kistaro play No Man's Sky for a while, and I watched a friend's video of them playing a platformer game with good graphics and a heartbreaking rendition of very dangerous robots destroying a very dangerous natural environment.

19:32.  32,935.  1,612.  I'm impatient to hit 1,667 words, after which I will see if my own save in No Man's Sky is still around.

20:02.  33,694.  2,371.  I'm going to turn it in, I want to try No Man's Sky now.

20:03.  Meratep's Travelogue is an estimated 38% complete!
