15:06.  113,326.

18:00.  113,326.  I have been utterly distracted all day long.  It's been a disastrous day.

18:01.  It's been Pyrex's birthday today!  Pyrex has been having a much better day.

18:02.  I was in a lot of pain this morning.  For the first few hours of my day, I was in like twice as much pain as I usually am.  It radiated from my forearms and my back.  I felt weak and on the verge of collapse.  When I eventually overcame the pain, I was...  still unable to focus productively.

18:08.  113,434.  That felt like significant progress, and quite fun.

22:37.  That was all I did today.  I couldn't focus on writing at all.  I get frustrated when my friends produce such small amounts of writing in a day, but I just did it.

22:38.  1.9 miles.  318 kcal.  6,721 steps. 1 hour, 19 minutes, and 11 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.

22:39.  Also, I actually did a little more.  113,460.  I did it earlier, not just now.

22:42.  I'm so frustrated by how little I got done today.  After the painful morning, I was... slack.  Relaxed.  At ease.  And UNPRODUCTIVE.  I was also hungry all day long.  I overate a bit to no avail.
