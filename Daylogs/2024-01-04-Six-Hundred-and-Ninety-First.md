7:18.  I told Akity that I'd be back to normal again today, and I'll try to be, but first I'm going to play a little more Equestria at War.  I want to start a campaign as the nation that can install Dawnfeather as regent if it takes over the Empire.

12:50.  I stopped playing a while ago, but I only just stopped obsessing about it.  I still want to play more.

13:11.  33,884.

13:24.  33,901.  I'm struggling.  I need to check in on Nationstates; I haven't yet today.

14:51.  Done with Nationstates.  I'm amazed at how long that game takes.  It's quite hard.  It seems so simple, but the choices are difficult to make.

18:53.  33,901.  I've been unable to write so far today.  I wasn't intending to take today off, but I've been wholly incapable of focusing.  I've just been...  distracted.  Frustrated.  Struggling.

23:44.  36,073.  2,172 words of progress.  That's it for tonight.

23:54.  9.5 miles.  1,741 kcal.  36,435 steps.  8 hours, 2 minutes, and 18 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.
