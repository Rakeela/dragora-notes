6:34.  Mindful of how long it took me to get my head together yesterday, I've decided to put together a post a little earlier today.

8:10.  I've been playing "I Was a Teenage Exocolonist"!  I've been playing a nerdy kid who wants to study all the time.

9:10.  I'm in pain, I think.  I'm kinda groaning, wincing, crying...  but I don't feel the pain.  Well, I feel a little bit, in my back and in my hips.  It doesn't hurt as much as I'm acting like it hurts.  It's like my sense of pain got disconnected somehow.

9:11.  I tried to get up and walk three steps, and I fell down.  I guess I need painkillers.  Even when I can't feel the pain, the painkillers make me stop acting like I'm in pain.

9:15.  Does pain cause me even more cognitive trouble than I thought?

10:07.  I'm starting to think I could write.  Or, technically, edit.  66,798... but it might still be a few minutes.

18:08.  Wow, hey.  I haven't written at all today.  Let's try this again.  66,798.

22:19.  It's hard to focus on this editing task.

22:22.  Credit 72 words edited.  66,909.
