9:26.  I got up at 8:47, but I'm just getting combobulated enough to get moving on my daily time-tracking.

10:56.  More than ten cards ago, I thought Wasteland Engineering was ten cards away from finishing.  127,923.

10:59.  Actually, I'm not working yet.  I loaded up the files, I put some thought in, I made a tiny tweak, and now I'm going to go out for a few minutes.  I'll keep thinking about it.

11:55.  I'm at work!  I have been poking at the file for a few minutes now, but wow, was that really, like, fifty minutes?  

16:24.  131,651.  Whoa wait really?  It can't be that much.

16:32.  131,811.  I'm working on ending stuff.

16:38.  131,992.  Working on a difficult bit.  It's hard to believe that I've already done thousands of words.  4,069 words of progress.  I guess today has been productive.

19:08.  135,305.  7,382 words of progress.  Huh.  If I keep going, I'm sure to set my one-day productivity record.

19:09.  Not sure I want to keep going, though.  I've done really well today.

19:29.  I feel like playing with AI Dungeon instead of writing.

21:47.  Well, I suppose that was two hours and twenty minutes, but it's kind of same-y and lacks agency.

22:16.  The problem with AI Dungeon is that it's not good at writing quadrupeds, and my fantasies are quaddie.

22:21.  I can do better than AI Dungeon with my own writing.  Also, one of their models is way too obsessive about basically being a chatbot.  It doesn't handle three character scenes very well.  It can't introduce new characters very effectively.

22:22.  In fairness, this may be a skill issue.  I may not be using the AI to its full potential.

22:30.  My history with AI Dungeon reveals my tendency to sexually objectify gryphons.  To lust after them, at least.  Is all lust sexual objectification?  I can write gryphon romances more easily than any other kind, too...
