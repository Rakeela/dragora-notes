4:34.  I completed my 24 hours without fluids.  There were no incidents.  I have eaten a meal and drank beverages.

4:37.  I wish Theoma were so popular that my Theoma novels would get graphic novel adaptations.

5:25.  One thing that fasting practices have taught me is that my eating and drinking behaviors are substantially driven by boredom rather than need.  I think of myself as someone who doesn't get bored easily, but that's false.  Maybe false.  I'm just accustomed to resolving boredom quickly by drinking from my typically large stock of diet soda.  Before I dieted, did I typically resolve boredom by *eating*?  That could explain why my weight trended upwards so much.

5:33.  I should've said "dieted or fasted" in the previous entry.

5:37.  24,540.  1,289 words on the chapter.

6:52.  25,227.  1,976 words on the chapter.  687 words of progress.

7:15.  25,523.  2,272 words on the chapter.

7:47.  25,652.  2,401 words on the chapter.  1,112 words of progress.  Almost ready to get back to Kaire, but I have to finish this chapter satisfyingly somehow.

8:55.  26,069.  2,807 words on the chapter.  1,529 words of progress.  Quota get.  Chapter complete.  Time to do a Kaire chapter... but I think I'm going to lay down for a few minutes first.  Tired.  No, wait.  I'm going to down an energy drink and keep working.

9:37.  I still ended up taking a lengthy break from writing, but I'm certainly more energetic now.  I was playing Flight Rising.  The colosseum in that game seems like a huge waste of time, but I've got a fair number of dragons through the training fields.  Someone gave me a level 25 dragon, too...

10:55.  There are crystals glinting on the surface of these "Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Brookies".  Ordinarily, I would expect crystals on a cookie to be sugar crystals.  Based on the flavour of these brookies, I believe those are actually salt crystals.  Remarkable.  Salty brownies should be their own genre, like salty licorice is.

11:22.  27,573.  1,496 words on the chapter.  3,033 words of progress.  Writing Kaire is so much easier and more fun than writing Kura.

11:47.  27,847.  1,770 words on the chapter.  3,307 words of progress.  Another Status screen.

13:08.  28,760.  2,683 words on the chapter.  

13:39.  28,972.  2,895 words on the chapter.

13:52.  29,035.  2,958 words on the chapter.

13:55.  29,057.  2,980 words on the chapter.

14:21.  2,992 words on the chapter.

15:39.  28,874.  New chapter.  4,334 words of progress.  I just finished a bit of a break, but coming back and realizing that I started at 5:37, with a 4k+ output, I think I've probably done enough today.
