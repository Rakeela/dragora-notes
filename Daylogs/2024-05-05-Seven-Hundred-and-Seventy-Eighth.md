12:32.  I get up at 7:40, somehow I don't get to work until now.

13:28.  Wow, where'd the last hour go?  I still haven't gotten to work.  I thought I was over being brain-fogged in the morning, but it came back.  

13:29.  25,256.  It's not exactly 'morning' brainfog when it lasts over five hours and doesn't go away until an hour and a half past noon.  Ugh.

22:19.  25,925.  669 words of progress.

22:29.  25,936.  680 words of progress.
