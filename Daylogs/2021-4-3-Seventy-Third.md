So...  Now I've got a specific experiment concept up, roughly described.  That's over at [[Universal-tolerogenic-dendritic-cell-experiment-1]].  I kind of feel like I'm in a "now what" stage.  I'm almost confident that I should keep studying this and producing testable hypotheses?  I'm *not quite* confident that I should keep studying this and producing testable hypotheses.  I feel like other hypotheses are going to be somehow worse than this one.

Also, I feel like my other ideas are sort of dwindling into ninja-space as I've gotten caught imagining my efforts as being about cloaking from the immune system.  Which isn't *worthless* or anything, but it is a bit disquieting.  Should I try to clear the cellular surface of other identifying signatures and then induce the formation of custom receptors that only anergize the immune system?  Should I try to make cells that surround themselves with a brew of 'I'm harmless' chemicals while hunting down mistrained T cells?  Ninja cells!

Last night in bed, Kistaro likened the immune system to a medichine swarm.  "Nature already made nanites," zie said.  It's such an amazing concept.  Molecular biology puts me closer to working on nanotechnology than I thought, and it's exciting.  I didn't know that was in the range of my potential.

Really, ideally, humanity needs some kind of consciously-guided interface for the immune system.  I don't know if making *that* is in my potential.  Life extension would be easier if it were possible to tell the immune system that it should go after such-and-such antigen, and it shouldn't go after this-the-other antigen.  For now though, producing any kind of injectable retraining impetus for the immune system would be great.

There's a cancer research internship open at a local research center.  I want to sign up for it, but Kistaro discouraged me, citing health risks.  So I won't!  Not until we're vaccinated.  Yet I'm very disappointed if I have to miss it, because the internship program says that they help interns complete a research project.  Which is...  I want to go!  It reads like a potential opportunity to get my work tested and published way earlier than I thought I could.  It reads like labwork opportunities with expert assistance to me.

Even though I'm focused on the ways that the immune system interacts with mental illness, aging, and arthritis, I also understand the connection between the work I want to do and cancer treatment.  The immune system is supposed to take down cancers.  Sometimes that works, but sometimes it ends up guarding them.  Tregs around a tumor are a bad sign.  Being able to retune the immune system would result in considerable advances in low-morbidity cancer treatment.

"In order to prevent a 'grey goo' scenario, we deliberately designed our nanites to rely on energetically unfavorable chemistry, with a dependency on broadcast power.  Cut the power, cut the replication.  This also broadened our use-cases, as there are many more thermodynamically unfavorable chemical transformations than thermodynamically favorable ones.  As long as we have electricity, we need no longer be bound by entropy."

This was a random thought which occurred to me about how to create nanoreplicants without having them eat everything.  Give them a reliance on an electrical supply!  You can't plug a nanite swarm into the wall, but you could plug a broadcast power station into the wall.  The range on broadcast power is pretty limited; Tesla's dream of powering a city without an infrastructure of electrical wiring was foolhardy.  Yet in this application, that malus is a virtue, as the nanoreplicants would not be able to spread beyond the range of the broadcast power station.

I also found myself imagining handheld 'broadcast wands' used to finely direct nanites.  I tend to imagine future humanity living in a bright albeit hazy world of individual nanite swarms, with most if not all people having their own personal swarm.  A stage where people have to use a powerpack backpack and a broadcast wand to direct their swarm could be an intermediary tech.

I read an article today about William Pierce, author of the Turner Diaries.  It was more about his son, Kevin Pierce, who is afraid that he has some kind of genetic flaw which shouldn't be passed on.  I'm grateful to my own dad for teaching me that there's a place for everyone in this world.  That lesson has been very protective for me.

I wish Jerry's attitude towards gay people had been clearer; sometimes he was okay with them, sometimes he was inexplicably hateful.  His opposition to gay people was *inarticulate*; something about the thought of homosexuality seemed to emotionally overload him.  For years I wondered if he got raped by a guy or something back in California, though I don't think that happened.  The only articulate thing I remember him ever saying about what 'the gay agenda' actually was, was that he thought they were stupid for opposing firearms rights, "because God made men and women, but Samuel Colt made them equal."  He was of the opinion that anyone 'marginalized' in society ought to be carrying firearms.  I used to be committed to that position as well; I'm still *of* of that position, but my attitude has tended towards 'whatever' on it.

He hated Muslims, too.  I wish he'd had better reasons for opposing Islamic influences.  I think he was correct, but I think he was correct because Islam opposes diversity in society, and is against his concept that everyone has a place.  That *wasn't* the argument he used.  Instead, he had some theological point that didn't make much sense to me, objecting to something about Islamic worship that I didn't understand and don't remember.  He also literally disliked turbans...  which was like... what?  Why would someone care that much about headgear?

I ordered donuts a few days ago for delivery this morning.  They're surprisingly good, so I want to give them a shout-out.  The store is called Factory Donuts, and the storefront is in Kirkland.  The banana fritter was the big novelty that drew me to it (donuts are not high on my hedonic ranking of foods); they were actually a little underflavorful and disappointing.  Yet everything else is very tasty, and the *texture* of the donuts is exceptionally correct, including the texture of the fritter.

It's difficult to have the stances that I have, knowing that liberalism will always consider me an enemy.  Yet I know that I live in a society, and idealism is about more than just what makes me comfortable.

Argh, I'm trying to write a short story, and it is *very hard*.  I could complain for five thousand words a day, but fiction is so much harder!  How do some people output massive daily word counts?  I want to live forever for so many reasons, but wanting to do some of the stuff that's *hard* is one of them.
