If I can, I want to do another nine hour day on my treadmill.

I've discovered a more palatable fat source for keto dieting: cocoa butter.  It's much tastier than cheese.

Seven hours into my daily exercise, I took a break.  When I got back up, my feet had stiffened or something.  It was painful to walk and I was moving quite slowly as I walked back to my treadmill.  I still managed.  I'll be walking past 9 PM at this rate, but I'll keep going with it.

Argh, it's 9 PM and I'm still walking.  I still have 80 minutes to go.  If I hit 9 hours tonight, I'll be going to bed right off the treadmill.

(Added the next day) Oh!  I worked so late, and then I just crashed out after meeting my exercise goal.  Haha.  Here it is.

18.8 miles, 2,653 kcal, 53,365 steps.  9 hours.  Average speed 2.1 mph.
