7:24.  A mind incapable of doubt is imperfect.  It is therefore necessary that God is imperfect.  For if God cannot doubt, they are imperfect, and if God can doubt, they are imperfect.  Of these claims, the one that I do not understand is "If God can doubt, they are imperfect."  I do not understand the necessary imperfection that is doubting.  The most perfect being should be capable of doubt.  I do not believe in a perfect being, but I do believe in a 'least imperfect', and sometimes I wonder if there is indeed a flawed but real God who is 'least imperfect' among all beings.

8:58.  Finished with morning stuff.  Should get to work.  Not exactly record time considering I got up at 5:45.  Morning stuff this time included a trip to the store where I bought cookies to eat this weekend as well as thirty pages of a book on theology.  That's an eighth of the book.  Man, I am hungry.  It's been over 42 hours since I last ate anything.  This is far from a record fast for me, but they never get easy.  Not so far at least.

9:17.  Ugh.  I was in pain at my last time point.  I'm...  I don't know.  Kind of in pain?  It's not at the forefront of my awareness, but it's there.  I resent my reliance on painkillers.  I fear I'll take too many painkillers.  I don't remember exactly if I've taken naproxen this morning, but I'm going to assume I haven't and go take some.

9:18.  I live with constant inflammation.  Psoriasis, arthritis, and I swear it seems like there's more.  Sometimes movement is hard.  I'm reluctant to bring out the treadmill today.  I guess I was wrong.  Pain IS at the forefront of my awareness right now.  I can't think about much else.  I even put down my book on theology.

9:19.  I've been doing minor irrelevant stuff to try to get my mind off of pain.  Flight Rising, Nationstates.  I already 'finished' this stuff.  It's part of my morning routine.  I deal with issues and post a few comments on Nationstates.  I bond with familiars, gather, transmute something, dig something, and collect dailies on Flight Rising.  This is... actually what 'morning stuff' is a euphemism for.  Stuff I'm kind of embarrassed to prioritize, but that I do prioritize, every morning.

9:22.  I want to eat.  I want to get my mind off of my suffering by eating something.  The particular suffering of having eaten too much is so much more satisfying than this.  People are supposed to be insatiable, right?  Feasting forever is never enough.  But I enjoy it, and I wish being satiated like that were a productive, healthy condition.

9:23.  I'm going to play Cultist Simulator for a while.  It helps me focus on work stuff... sometimes.

11:06.  I played for a while.  I managed to get the Frangiclave again, so I can start using the Peacock Door.  Woo?  Yay?  I didn't feel especially inspired this time.  I just feel hungry.

11:26.  I... can't... think!  I'm going to go for a walk!  Again!  I'm going back to the store to check on their discount cookie supply again!  I'm so hungry!  45 hours!

11:27.  At least while walking to the store I can get myself to read a book!

12:15.  I am mad today.  I must be.  I can get nothing done.

17:59.  I thought about the principle of Winter in Cultist Simulator.  It is the principle of silence, of endings, and of things that are not quite dead.  I am not quite dead.  I think I can get some editing done today.

18:01.  76,761.

18:21.  77,064.  I've done some of the editing.  The word count will go down a bit when I trim out a pair of paragraphs that I underlined while working on them.

19:31.  77,373.  612 words of progress.  Credit 2,328 words of editing.  Credit 1,287 words of editing.  3,615 words of editing.

19:34.  The editing task I just finished is what I wanted to finish *yesterday*.  I hope my *madness* recedes again so that I can work.
