I wish I could just view humanity from afar.  Humans are interesting, but I don't like being in the blast radius.  I feel like setting foot anywhere on this planet involves being under the minimum safe distance to humanity.

Today was pretty much wasted.  After hours spent pretty much staring at walls (more like staring at the floor), I decided to spend hours staring at a furry porn game instead.  It was, *relatively speaking*, a productive use of my time; instead of engaging with nothing in particular, I was at least engaging with someone else's strange creative thoughts.  I can now say I've played out most of the available content of an incomplete game.  It wasn't awful.

It was still a depressing and unhedonic conduct, though.  It depresses me that society is so deprived of real emotional connections that they can't tell porn from pleasure.  How many men have been treated as useless sluts until they had nothing to do but grimly try to find some satisfaction in the role they were given?

Nobody's even actually treating me that way now.  It's just a way that I've been treated, and which I couldn't stop thinking about all day until I drowned it out with a porn game.  Porn games are an easy, yet stimulating kind of media.  They're chill, but ugly.  They're also relevant enough to what upset me that I could transition into focusing on one, but far enough away that I couldn't keep thinking about old trauma.

When I drowned myself in porn games years ago and called it 'studying for writing', I think I was doing the same thing then, but without insight.
