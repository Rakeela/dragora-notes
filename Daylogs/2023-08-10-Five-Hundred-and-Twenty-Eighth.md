7:32.  19,234 words on the file.

8:40.  19,808.

9:17.  20,120.  Taking a break.  I'll try to remember to mark a time point when I resume.

10:08.  I'm back.

11:35.  20,837.  Taking another break.  My thoughts aren't clear about what happens next, and it's more productive (usually) to load up Cultist Simulator for a few minutes rather than struggle with it.

12:49.  How long did I spend that time?  I'm back.  I've been clearing cursed lands in Cultist Simulator while painting an endless stream of 10-Heart paintings.  Unstoppable optimism!

14:57.  Cords got caught up when I attempted to roll my treadmill back out from under my desk, and the treadmill itself got unplugged in the process.  I lost my treadmill progress!  I think I had walked for three hours, much of it at 1.5 mph.  That will have to be added to whatever total I develop.  I still have only 20,837 on the file, so you can see I have not been back to the writing.  I stopped for a house cleaning...  1,603 words of progress.

17:19.  21,902.  2,668 words of progress.  2,463 words on the chapter.

18:52.  23,052.  Chapter complete.  3,818 words of progress.

19:27.  23,406.  4,172 words of progress.

20:28.  23,830.  4,596 words of progress.
