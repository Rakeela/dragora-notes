9:56.  I overslept for a doctor's appointment.  I thought my watch would wake me better if I turned it out of silent mode, but I don't remember perceiving anything at all from it.

10:18.  75,992.  76,025.

11:27.  76,096.  Somehow, that little bit of writing felt disproportionately important.

11:28.  Everything I'm writing feels disproportionately important right now.  I feel like this is a stretch of the novel that *matters*, and I don't know if I'm doing well enough at it.  I can tell some of this won't survive edits.

15:07.  I've been doing other things.  I went out to a store to buy post-Christmas candies.  I ate a pound of fried okra.  I ate a box of candy.  Not in that order.  I have no idea what to write next in my story.  What do I need...?

15:08.  I need Meratep to get better at flight.  I need Meratep to get better at deciding what she wants to do with her life.

19:50.  78,166.  2,174 words of progress.  I think I need to work on The Turning Wind now.

21:03.  I'm putting the treadmill away for the night.  9.2 miles.  1,580 kcal.  34099 steps.  6 hours, 51 minutes, and 13 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.
