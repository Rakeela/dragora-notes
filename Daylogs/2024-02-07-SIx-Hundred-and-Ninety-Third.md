10:00.  I got up at about 8:13 this morning and I can't account for the time since then.  I feel like I'm only just now getting started with my day.

11:13.  Greifensmarchen got stomped!

11:20.  There must be some way to make Greifensmarchen win.  There is so much content for a pan-Griffonian Equestrophilic regime.

11:22.  39,585.  

11:45.  39,925.  I'm going to go play Nationstates now.

12:48.  Done with Nationstates.

12:52.  6,628.  Working on a worldbuilding file.

13:08.  6,871.  243 words of progress.  Credit to Ord (Worldbuilding).

15:18.  41,562.  1,977 words of progress.  I'm going to go across town and use some shopper rewards I have for the import store over there.

16:27.  I bought a bag full of chocolate!  Really good chocolate.  I love chocolate.  It doesn't feel like a mistake to eat chocolate.

16:28.  I actually have a really strong shame response.  It hits me socially and makes socializing less rewarding.  I hate anything that feels like 'an error'.  I can make technical, social, or creative errors and feel that way.

16:29.  Food doesn't trigger shame responses for me.  It doesn't feel like 'an error' to binge on food.  I've been wondering today what I'd be like if I had a strong sense of 'making errors' when I ate.  Probably anorexic.

16:30.  Social errors tend to feel worst.  They hit me so hard that the risk (and reality) of making them makes socializing considerably less rewarding for me.

19:03.  41,871.  2,286 words of progress.  Hmf.  Today has not been highly productive.

19:04.  I'm getting a headache.

19:06.  I'm going to try a maximally-boosted Greifensmarchen.

19:49.  I had to install a mod to enable it, but I have a boosted Greifensmarchen!  I don't think it will be enough of a boost, but I will try it.
