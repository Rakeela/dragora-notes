#2024-01-27-Six-Hundred-and-Eighty-Fourth

10:12.  I got up at around 6:30, but I faffed about for hours.  I like taking free time before I start work.  

10:14.  19,320.  I looked at Equestria at War, a megamod for Hearts of Iron 4, and I discovered that Kistaro owns Hearts of Iron 4.  I'm like, wait what?  Since when does Kistaro play that?  So it seems wasteful for me to buy it as well, but I'll probably pick it up at some point when it's on sale, just so I can play ponybattles.

10:15.  Or the Griffon Empire campaign.  It looks pretty awesome.

11:03.  19,684.  Switching over to morning Nationstates play.

13:27.  I stopped playing Nationstates a while ago, but I hit up the grocery store.

14:14.  Okay, let's get back to work.

16:12.  20,266.  My treadmill broke!  It turned off suddenly and it won't turn on.

17:49.  20,281.  The treadmill is working again.  I wasn't very productive while it was down...  961 words of progress today.  VERY disappointing.

18:50.  I am trying a new method of fasting-tracking.  My previous method was no longer holding my attention securely enough to see me through long fasts.  Now I am doing the previous thing, and another thing!  Every ten minutes, I will fill a box in a sheet of grid paper.  Every hour, I will skip one box.  Thus, every seventh box will be empty, marking an hour.  These sheets will give me a visual aid for how well I'm doing at fasting.  I may even be able to put a time lapse together showing my improvement over time.

20:22.  1.6 miles.  313 kcal.  6,682 steps.  1 hour, 27 minutes, and 4 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.  I walked for far longer earlier, over six hours, but I don't have the time for that.

20:26.  20,832.  1,512 words of progress.  Not a great night, but I made progress.
