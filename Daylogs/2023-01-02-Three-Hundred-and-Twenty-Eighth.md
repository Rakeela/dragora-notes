I'm fasting this week!  I can eat a little bit every day, but I'm trying to keep my body in ketosis and burning fat by eating less than four hundred calories per day while avoiding carbohydrates.  This particular modification of a fasting regimen is how I lost most of the weight that I have historically lost.  Glycogen weight melts off quickly as usual, but fat weight is stubborn.

One thing that I enjoy about a routine of mostly fasting while eating a little bit each day is just how satisfying it makes small meals become.  The satisfaction never lasts long, but for a few minutes after each little meal, I feel completely satisfied.

Of course, then I start longing for the next little meal.  I'm not sure whether eating a small amount per day makes this easier or harder.

I played Cyberpunk 2077 for (I think) an hour and a half today.  I've been ignoring the main quest to run gigs for "eurodollars", the currency in the game.  One of the contacts wants me to pay up 21k, and I've almost scraped that together.

I've been leaving the majority of my enemies alive in that game.  Incapacitations are as good as kills for all purposes so far.  Leaving enemies with survivable wounds feels better than gunning down an implausible number of enemies along the way.  To beat enemies into unconsciousness without killing them, I've found the best weapon in the game so far is a baseball bat.  Sometimes I hit enemies one too many times and still end up killling them, so the even better way to not kill them is to hit them with nonlethal takedowns.  As if nobody ever died from being choked out, eh?

It's such a violent game.  The protagonist is a total bullet sponge, too.  So are most of the enemies.  If real people could survive that many bullet wounds, wars would be very different.  Berserker tactics would be more popular.

When I play the game, I'm roleplaying a crazy violent woman with a bat.  She doesn't *like* killing people, but she does it sometimes.  She *likes* beating people unconscious, and sometimes they die in the process.  What a character!  I would never write about such a person.
