15:21.  I decided to take today off, because I feel empty-headed and brain-fogged.  I can still play No Man's Sky, and I did.  It's easy.  Even though I'm playing on permadeath, I can handle the challenges that it throws at me.  Making progress in an easy world is so tempting.  I just want life to be easy.  Eventually however, the empty-headed sensation got to me, and No Man's Sky felt empty, too.

15:22.  I'm 29 hours into a new fast.  I haven't set a longer target yet, but I want to clear my fasting record.
