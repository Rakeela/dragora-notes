11:56.  My pants fit again, without a belt.

12:36.  19,478.  But I'm demoralized.

12:49.  19,496.  I'm stuck randomly feeling like crying.

12:54.  Wow, reading a few pages of the gay romance on my desk doesn't help.  I stopped right in front of another sex scene.  Maybe I ought to just avow that I'm sex-repulsed.  I get excited by stories of dragons riding dragons, but I can't stand reading about human sexuality.

12:56.  Even the dragons thing is more towards tolerance than enthusiasm.  I don't seek out dragon smut.

12:57.  I'm just paging past the sex scene.  I'll pick up anything important from the context.

15:37.  20,413.  935 words of progress.  I just can't get stuck into it today.  My focus is everywhere.  I keep thinking about sweets... and about vegetable snacks...  eating a whole bunch of vegetarian stuff just added to the list of longings I have.  I could stop eating sweets again, but I'll still have to commit to only eating once a day in order to lose weight.  I'm going to go out for a bit.

17:30.  I went to Half Price Books and bought some cool-looking stuff.  Then I came back and played Lilith's Throne for a while.  I'm developing a slave mansion of kindly slaves.  I train them until they're very obedient, while treating them well enough that they grow fond of me.  When they're fully developed...  I free them!

17:32.  The idea of the kindly slave thing is that the kind ones want to abolish slavery.  By building up a network of kindly friends, I'm roleplaying an abolitionist.

19:00.  20,830.  1,352 words of progress.  This hasn't been fun at all.  It's been a real struggle to make progress.

21:31.  21,805.  2,327 words of progress.  God, I'm scraping here.  I'm making progress so fucking slowly.

21:35.  I want to stop here for the night.

21:36.  That's only 7 hours of work, counting for the disruption in the middle of the day.  I'd kinda rather have a twelve hour day with a stunning word count rather than a 7 hour day with a mediocre one.

22:01.  22,020.  I'm still working.

23:02.  22,020.  I wasn't able to get anything else done.  I don't know if the last hour qualifies as work.  I was distracted, unable to think of anything to add to the story.  2,542 words of progress.  This is it, I'm turning it in.

23:04.  9.3 miles.  1,707 kcal.  35,447 steps.  7 hours, 53 minutes, 20 seconds. Average speed 1.1 mph.
