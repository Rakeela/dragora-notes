12:45.  I have started out my day by playing Bombe.  I am inching forward now, but I'm coming up on the 5,000 squares achievement.  I wrote a massively spammy +1 bombs rule that has been an absolute bane of my boards.  I don't know how to use the massively cluttered boards.  Dev feedback suggests as much as 80% of regions should be trashed for advanced play.  An 11 tile region that contains at least 1 bomb is not a good region, and I should probably write a rule that filters those out.  The problem is, that loses information.  The game warns about that.  I think it'll let me write the rule, but I wish I could come up with a way to define 80% of my regions as logically irrelevant, so that I wouldn't lose information by trashing regions.

12:49.  There.  I wrote a rule that trashes x+ regions of size x+4 or greater.  I've also written a rule that trashes not-X rules of size x+4 or greater.  These lose information, but should speed board processing.

12:55.  7,558.

17:13.  9,448.  1,890 words of progress.  9.5 miles.  1,633 kcal.  32,983 steps.  7 hours, 9 minutes, 47 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.

17:22.  9,549.  It's hard to keep working.

17:27.  Ugh.  I don't want to write anymore.  I don't want to do anything.  Maybe feast.

17:29.  I have lost weight this week by eating one meal a day.  I didn't take the weekend off.  I ate one meal every day on the weekend, too.  If I just keep doing it, maybe my weight will go down.  But I have noticed that the amount I eat at that one meal has been going up.

18:07.  I'm not anything but hungry right now.  I feel terrible.

(This part added the next day.)  I actually kept writing a little longer.  I ended with 10,024 words written.  That was 2,466 words of progress.
