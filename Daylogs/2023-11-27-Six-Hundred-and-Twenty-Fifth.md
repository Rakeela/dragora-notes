9:50.  17,244.

14:03.  18,738.  1,494 words of progress.  It's been slow going.

14:13.  18,755.  Oh god, I'm bored.

14:20.  I created a new theome today.  That should've been fun, but it wasn't.  If I were making steady progress in my writing, I'd create a second new theome today.  I'm not sure I will.  If I don't make it today, I'll make it tomorrow.  I hope it'll be fun.

15:35.  I played Caves of Qud for a while.  My current run is going abnormally well.

15:39.  My tendency to boredom is a catastrophe.  Why do I eat too much?  Really, I get bored.  I drink too much caffeine out of boredom.  What tempts me to alcohol?  Boredom.  Boredom doesn't usually stop my writing, but it does occasionally.

16:32.  19,285.  2,041.  Argh.  It's...  getting easier, but still a struggle.  I'm so distracted.  Want this, want that, so many wants.  I don't want to want petty, harmful stuff.  I like and value attachments *sort of*, but I have so many *bad* attachments.

16:54.  I loaded up Caves of Qud and played it for a little while, but I took a stupid risk and died.  I got to level 19 that time.

16:57.  I still want to eat something.  I always want to eat something.

22:42.  19,478.  I haven't been working for most of the last few hours, but I've been working for the last hour.  2,234 words of progress.
