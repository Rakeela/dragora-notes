I've been experimenting with lotus paste recently.  I've discovered three things that lotus paste goes well with.

1) I discovered that lotus paste goes well with a simple salty flavor, by pairing it with chips.
2) I discovered that lotus paste goes well with soft things, by pairing it with a soft baked kind of biscuit.
3) I discovered that lotus paste goes well with cashews, by pairing it with cashews.

I think that a soft cashew cookie topped with lotus paste would be delicious.  I would want just a modicum of salt in the recipe, I think.
