I'm just starting in on a work of Christian apologetics.  It has no chance of converting me to Christianity, but I was hoping for some insightful cultural commentary.  The introduction is making me regret committing to read it.  It charges every competing worldview with "reductionism" and talks about how every worldview (except its own) is flawed when "absolutized".  My first impression of this claim is that it is intellectually dishonest; my revised impression of this claim is that it is unempathetic.  The book is all about "hidden worldviews".  Nobody "absolutizes" their own worldview this way without intense intellectual engagement with it.  The "hidden" worldviews are all anti-reductionist because people only engage with them to the extent that they serve a full understanding of the world.  Why can't the author comprehend that?  Falling back on the complaint of reductionism belies a lack of comprehension unbefitting a professor.

The next page addresses "worldview as story", and it immediately reminds me of why I'm disappointed with religious thinking.  It's all very well and good to have one well-analyzed text in common, but it seems sad not to have several well-analyzed texts in common with one's community.  Having then several well-analyzed texts in common with one's community as some of them do, why are they so limited to the first?  Religious thinking seems petty and small-souled.

Religious people would call regarding religion as "small" to be "too proud" and it's like...  you're the side that's so narcissistic you think you can derive your life's guidance from a single source.  Humble yourself and you'll turn atheistic.  Scientists tend to be very humble.  Their whole method resolves around acknowledging uncertainty.

Now I'm depressed.  Religious people are so abundant, and their arrogance is endangering the world.

This book makes me want to break my fast.  It's sapping my will to live.  It just equated morality with action.  As if moralists were capable of being moral!  Oh my god, this person is adding naivety to pettiness and lack of empathy.  Many of the evillest people in history were moralists; many of the evillest people today *are* moralists.

Even when I was younger, this would have appalled me.  I would have then equated morality and ethics, assigning them both to the realm of ideals and denying that either was the actual domain of action.  This attempt to equivocate morality and deed would have struck me as theistic supremacism: an attempt to posit the moral superiority of people who prefer the term 'moral', a position that I would have then rejected as improbable given that moralists seemed ethically inferior to ethicists.  I still do assign morality and ethics to a shared position in the realm of ideals, but my position on moralists has since darkened from skepticism to hostility.  Nobody hates likes like a "loving" moralist.

Reading this book was supposed to be a nice exercise in cross-cultural understanding, but where I disagree with this book I feel helpless in the face of bigotry.

I put away my upset and read on a few pages farther, until I got to this gem about the difference between what people say and what they do: "A moral relativist may live as if universal moral standards do exist."  ARGH.  This guy comes off as unqualified to be a professor of ethics!  Of course relativists have actual moral convictions, they ALL do.  By the time people have thought about morality enough to BE relativists, THEY HAVE FIRMLY ENGRAINED PREFERENCES ABOUT RIGHT ACTION.  They as relativists don't hold those preferences to be universal moral truths, but in most circumstances will still behave as if they were, because that's what the relativist in question considers their OWN position.  This is lack of empathy!  This guy wrote a book about dismantling competing worldviews without understanding competing worldviews.  I'm only 23 pages in.  This book is enraging.

The belief in universal moral standards is not necessary for a person to be principled!  This is a BASIC misunderstanding of relativism.  The ignorance burns.  I'm not even a relativist.  I haven't thought about it enough in the right way.  I doubt moral relativism.

He carries on beating at the relativist position on page 23.  He claims that relativist demands for tolerance are in contradiction of relativist rejections of universal principles.  That is not true.  The demand for tolerance is not a separate axiom, but a logical consequence of the rejection of universality.  Since a universal standard does not exist, therefore there is not a standard for sufficient confidence to reject competing postulates, and therefore the principle of indecision rejects hostile action.  It is not necessary to hold that tolerance is paradoxical in order to be skeptical of relativism and I reject this guy's takedown of relativism as ignorant.

This guy's hatred of relativism makes it look like he's a raving dogmatist who shouldn't qualify for a professor of ethics position.  The phrase "dog-eat-dog chaos" is used against relativism.  That's insanely unempathetic.  He has zero empathy for the relativist position.

Chapter 2.  Individualism.

On page 25 he cites someone who writes favorably of the process of zealous reinforcement whereby people who surround themselves with like-minded peers tend to become entrenched in their dogmas.  He's writing about echo chambers from the perspective of someone who really likes a particular kind of echo chamber.  That is NOXIOUS.  It's tribalism.

Page 26: "The Christian worldview places an extremely high value on life".  That is complete bullshit and highly biased.  It's either trivial or false.  Almost every ideal places an ostensible high value on life.  Christianity doesn't have a special claim.  It also fails its value on life extensively, promoting hatred and ignorance across society, mistreating children and declaring deviancies "evil" when they're nothing more than different.  A Christian theocracy would be a literal hell on Earth, and with the extensive lack of compassion in a fully realized Christian worldview, there's no reason to expect it would have a higher value on "life" than our own society.

God.  Page 28 refers to laws prohibiting bribery as "a restriction on personal behavior".  Good god almighty!  If someone needs their behavior RESTRICTED in that way, it would be highly unusual for them to also be a good person.  Laws prohibiting bribery defend the freedom of action of almost everyone.  It's not a restriction to anyone who wouldn't bribe someone and in many cases it's a positive defense of freedom by preventing distortions that would limit actions based on who can provide the best bribe.  America is lacking in freedom today in part because it restricts personal behavior at the behest of leaders who can pay for power.

On page 29, this guy takes askance with the idea that Christians can be Christians while not going to Church.  He marks it as an individualist distortion of faith.  In general, he marks personal convictions separate from community mandates to be individualist distortions of faith.  Where's the respect for conviction in this writer?  He was talking so extensively about the need for conviction just a few pages prior.

This guy maligns individualism as inherently self-centered.  Again, he's expressing a wild lack of empathy.  People expressing their own individual nature also express their own individual need for others.

...Finally.  Page 30.  First thing that seems insightful.  He proposes that individualism is a defensive reaction to institutional corruption.  Submission and conformity to institutions is posited to be highly disappointing given the historic unwillingness of institutions to protect the interests of their people.  This makes sense.

Page 31 immediately mucks it up by proposing a shoddy causality proposing that individualism leads to "the ends justify the means" thinking.  No.  It does not.  This goes back to the lack of empathy.  I'm going to say this again: people expressing their own individual nature also express their own individual need for others.  I think this guy mucks up his whole attitude against what he calls "expressive individualism" by failing to notice that expressive individualists aren't just deviant, they form whole supportive communities around their unusual interests.  They're not hostile to literally every social more, they're trying to found idealistic clusters around their preferred mores.  He's taking down something he doesn't understand.  Again.

I can foresee a bad review for this book and it's going to be hard to hold the length of the review in check.  How do I prioritize what to say when there's something wrong with so many pages so far?  On page 31 he uses a random-ass anecdote to justify claiming that individualism leads to dishonesty.  It was something he overheard a stranger say without context.  That's an empathy fault and an intellectual fault.  He shouldn't "know" that what he randomly overheard has anything to do with individualism.

Page 32 takes down individual conviction.  Again.  Has this guy never heard of people having convictions despite faulty authorities?  Has he never dissented with anyone else's judgment?  Of course the individual is "the authoritative source of what is right and wrong".  Jesus Christ stood in defiance of the authorities and society of his day.  A verse of the bible, already cited by this book, reminds the faithful not to be patterned by the mores of the day.  That's individual conviction, not community conviction.  Christians are supposed to model themselves after God's embodiment on Earth, but that doesn't mean they're not supposed to have individual convictions.  That means their individual convictions are supposed to be as near to Jesus Christ's individual convictions as their soul can bear to get.

Page 33 argues that freedom as a cardinal value devalues justice as a cardinal value.  JUSTICE IS INTEGRAL TO LIBERATION.  God, this guy has no empathy, and he projects.  He argues in the same passage that freedom devalues empathy.  That's backwards.  Individuals expressing their own individual nature also express their own individual need for others.  Respect for individuals IS empathy.  His construction of individualism as contrary to individual self-transformation is just faulty.  It's ignorant.  Individuals shape their own convictions and reform themselves all the time.  This doesn't mean "goodness is obtained by rearrangement of external circumstances", which claim simply mangles the idea of goodness.  He treats courage as devalued by individualism because courage is an "external standard"... what the fuck.  Expressive individualists are generally proud of their courage and hold it as a high value.  The courage of their convictions is supposed to be on display, or else their freedom to be themselves is not being respected.

This guy would like individualism a lot more if he were more empathetic to it.  He's pressing a bigotry.  It's blinding him to the communities of others.  It's blinding him to both the softnesses and the strengths of people he disagrees with.  He sees the death of community like a bull sees the matador's cape; likewise does he run himself against the death of idealism that he sees.  He should be seeing communities of individuals.

The bottom of page 33 immediately contradicts the argument that the individualist judges the worth of their own convictions by arguing that individualism requires a determination for individual success.  The top of page 34 takes down the concept of the hero, and the page proceeds to link individualism and the concept of the hero by arguing that individualist stories reject "the bumbling sidekick".  It then argues that expressive individualists measure their success by the distance they create between their performance and society, which is a bigoted perspective.

Again.

The expressive individualist isn't measuring their success by their ability to kick society.  That's not expressive individualism, that's literally trolling.  It's one of the banes of individual creators who value their self-expression.  It's also rare.  Most expressive individualists are measuring their success by their proximity to a small, personally meaningful alternative community that upholds their individual convictions.

His perspective is the perspective of the enraged authority.  Instead of seeing the people he disagrees with as doing things that fulfill their own social needs, he projects the view that they're just trying to offend moral guardians, which is apparently his own position as a professor of theology and ethics.  He's a moral guardian.  He doesn't see the communities that form around artists, because apparently he's not part of any of them.  Writing a book didn't make him an artist in a way that would help him recognize it.

He values conviction, but is troubled by the inherently individual nature of conviction.

This guy's bigotry weakens a bit when he troubles himself to write favorably of individualism.  He starts to express some empathy for individualists.  He doesn't go far enough.  He doesn't acknowledge the individualist origins of healthy communities.  He does acknowledge the individual nature of conviction.  And...  it's really kinda heartbreaking...  he talks about how individually chosen beliefs "are held with greater conviction".  No, you putz.  They're the only real kind at all.  The expression of socially mandatory belief is literally a form of lying.  Individual conviction is the only real kind; some people just happen to have individual convictions that line up with the individual convictions of moral guardians.

Page 38 lays out three metaphysical claims of individualism.  They're just wrong.  Individualism isn't self-aggrandizing the way he argues.  His takedown of individual significance makes him seem like he would be cold to people he should be valuing as an individual.  He proceeds to take down individualism as loveless, again ignoring that expressive individualists typically create loving communities if they can.  He then takes down individualism's ostensible reliance on judging individuals by their performance, something he never established as a trait of individualism at all, as in my opinion he relied upon a contradictory argument.  His view of expressive individualists as intrinsically rebels is fucking cold and it evinces an establishment bias so strong it has prevented him from understanding the actual position he inveighs against.

I have just worked my way through a chapter of a bigoted moral authority taking down something he's too prejudiced against to understand.  Maybe the next chapter will be better.

He closes the chapter by taking down individualism as self-centered again, but that's a goddamn bogeyman.  People expressing their own individual nature also express their own individual need for others.

Chapter 3.  Consumerism.

Page 45: "One unique feature of a consumerist worldview is that almost no one will admit that they believe that salvation can be found by acquiring and using things."  So first off, this guy described salvation as the fulfilment of needs, which I disagree with, but I'll accept the redefinition for the sake of argument.  Secondly, this is wrong.  There's good research supporting that more money makes people happier.  Having their physical needs met is not sufficient for everything people want in life, but it's a really important start and makes a vital impact on their happiness.  Some people can be really lucid about this, especially if they're aware of research into human psychology.  This gets into scientific materialism - something the guy already mentioned and put aside, saying that's for chapter 6.

It's not really clear to me that religion fulfills peoples' needs at all, and it seems like it largely doesn't even try.  The rise of apatheism speaks to people seeking their needs elsewhere and regarding religion as only a small component of who they are.  They have diminished religion in proportion to its need-satisfying capability.  It doesn't actually vanish because it has non-zero need satisfaction power, but it doesn't win in their lives because it isn't connected to the satisfaction of most of their needs.

I'm entering page 46 with a guarded optimism.  This guy's opposition to consumerism isn't as philosophically untenable as his opposition to individualism.  He's arguing against useless excesses here.  Modern society is using a ton of resources and it's unclear that the massive use of resources is making people happier.  There's potentially a point.  His point is a bit weakened by his religious conviction that fulfilment can't be bought.  More accurately, fulfilment can't always be bought.  It can sometimes be bought.

Hmm, page 49.  "People are viewed as objects to consume."  Nope, he's being unempathetic again.  This argument puts up a wall between people without accurately embodying the social needs of anyone in particular.  This kind of argument against consumerism only mischaracterizes people, fuels bad blood, stops actual social understanding, etc.  I can tell he's gonna keep returning to this and it's gonna keep being a flaw in his argument.

Page 51.  Argues that consumerism makes relationships transactional, that relationships should have intrinsic value, and that regarding relationships as transactional to meet needs rather than intrinsically valuable is bad.  The argument about the value of relationship needs compromise; relationships should be neither fully intrinsic nor fully transactional.  The argument that consumerism makes relationships transactional is, at this point in the book, unfounded.  It's just postulated without justification.  He doesn't link it to consumerism.

This guy's argument that consumerism is too reductionistic sounds valid, though I disagree with his prescription for religion as a replacement.  Religious thinking is pretty reductionistic; it reduces everything to faith!  Replacing one bad reduction with another doesn't improve things, and might make it worse, as money seems like a less wrong reduction than faith.  Money won't serve all needs and faith won't serve all needs, but money will serve more needs than faith.

Chapter 4: Nationalism

Page 62.  This guy states that patriotism is a good and necessary thing.  Why?  Why the blazes does it matter at all?  I don't think Jesus would've been a patriot at all.

This chapter is mostly addressed as an overly-gentle rebuke of sensitive Christian nationalists who don't understand how bad their ideas are.  I guess I should be glad to see that?  Except on page 71 it repeats the oppressive and empathy-deficient condemnation of individualism as selfishness.

Page 71 also praises nationalism as "helping overcome tribalism"...  as supporting diversity.  Nationalists, it suggests on page 72, are less prejudiced and less inclined to stereotype others.  Not very damned likely.  This guy is so blinkered.  Neigh, I say.

Oh god, page 73 praises relativistic tolerance.  There's no way he caught himself doing that.  Even a moral absolutist can behave like a moral relativist sometimes!  How am I going to REVIEW this book?

Speaking of which, Chapter 5 is the takedown on moral relativism.  That's going to be a shitshow.  I'm not doing that tonight.

This book was a shattering challenge to my will to fast.  I withstood it, but I bought like two bags full of candy, too.  The reign of empathy-deficit tyrants doesn't really make me want to be perfectly healthy.  They want their world free of individual dissent and communities that form in disagreement with them, yeah?  Communities where individual conviction is crushed by received community values, and something as simple as prohibitions against bribery are recast as necessary restrictions on personal freedom?  They want their communities where people who are free bribe others, yeah, necessitating that people not be free because there's no actual wellspring of virtue underlying them?

So this is "Hidden Worldviews" by Steve Wilkens and Mark L. Sanford.  I'm only partway through it.  79 pages.  The book is 218 pages long.  It's suffering to read.  This is propaganda from someone who doesn't understand how much bigotry has blocked their comprehension of people they disagree with.

My personal impression is that there's like, no actual wellspring of virtue in conservativism.  Liberals are good people who don't want to be coerced into being "good" people.  Conservatives are bad people who want to be coerced into being good people.  The liberal world doesn't coerce conservatives to be good, and that makes conservatives look like shit.

I mentioned candy.  I'm fasting, sort of.  My "fasting" really amounts to having one small meal per day.  I don't fast religiously.  I diet extremely and track it like a fast to make myself mostly do it.  Yesterday and today I also ate a bunch of sugar-free candy each day.  That really cleaned out my intestines.  I haven't marked it against my fast.  I praised God for the diarrhea.  I appreciated it.

I've been buying a ton of candy, and not the sugar-free kind.  Obviously, I'm not eating it yet.  I often buy some candy while fasting, but I've bought more than usual.  I might have set a new record this time.  I'm attempting a record fast.  I've been sick of my weight not breaking through a specific plateau and I'm trying to break my fasting record to fix that.  I'm 95 hours in, or about 4 days.  I've set a target of 252 hours, or 10.5 days.

Of all the things I've bought, the greatest temptation is that I bought some red velvet cookies.  If I fail early, it'll be because I ate those.  If I succeed, I'll devour them first.

Severe dieting seems to have completely destroyed my will to eat in a normal, regulated fashion.  I am not mastering my drive for food.  I am far more gluttonous than I was before I started starving myself.  I wonder if this contributes to rebound weight gain.  Normal limits on food consumption are now appalling to me.  I look forward to eating myself sick.

My weight soars and crashes.  The rises and the drops are both far faster than they were.  This feasting and famine pattern is stressful but enjoyable to me.  I prefer it to the way I ate before... and my weight is stabler than it used to be, sort of.  My average weight changes less from one week to the next, instead of climbing slowly as it used to when I ate every day with relative moderation.  I think I'll still eat this way if I reach my target weight.

Since I do eat a little bit every day - the meal I'm happy with today was a lentil wrap with tahini sauce, and it was amazingly delicious - in theory I could diet like I do for much, much longer.  When I target new records with my fasting, I always wonder if this is going to be the time when I finally have the will to just keep going.  If I could just keep losing weight, I'd make much steadier progress.  God though, it's so hard.  My fixation on food has only been getting worse.  I'm a depraved introvert, and contentment for me has become a full belly.  By the time I get thin, I'm going to be a devouring demon.
