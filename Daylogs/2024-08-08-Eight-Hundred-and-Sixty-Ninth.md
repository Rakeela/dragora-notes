(This part added the next day.)  Yesterday was fun, until late in the evening, when my mood went seriously, disablingly dreary for some reason.  I had a TTRPG session, too.  It went well.  Oh, and my exercise times!  10.3 miles.  1,749 kcal.  36,346 steps.  7 hours, 28 minutes, and 36 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.
