14:08.  You know, I think it's actually fucked up that Octavia is canonically asexual in Helluva Boss.  It's okay in isolation, I'm asexual myself, but it strikes me as part of the weird conservatism of Helluva Boss.  The youngest character in the cast is asexual.  It's a conservative way to cast the character.  At that age myself, I was in denial of being asexual.

14:12.  I was never sexually interested in any real person.  As I've said a couple of times in a couple of contexts, "The plumbing works, but humans are ugly."  I don't hold it against people.  I like people!

14:13.  It's just like living in a world of ugly aliens and being expected to have a libido.  I'm only attracted to my own species... and gryphons, for some reason.

19:41.  I've been entranced by sexual content.  It's such a stripped down breeder simulation...  A life of nothing but sex, in a body tuned to be extremely capable of it.  If pregnancies took five days, there were no infertile intervals between pregnancies, and people were desperately horny, the population growth would be insane.

19:45.  I'm talking about Broken Dreams Correctional Facility.  That game horrified me at first.  It still kinda does.  It's a nightmare vision.

19:49.  If I played 'myself' in that game, the horror would be greatly intensified.  I'd have to build a character with very sex-negative views.

21:38.  Credit 127 words edited.  I spent a while sorting art on FurAffinity.  I'm behind on that task.  I took a collection of 2,606 items down to 1,980 items.  I suspect it has a final tally of something like 900 items when fully pruned, but I can't tell without going through all of it.

21:39.  Sorting art was a pleasurable task, but a guilty pleasure, as I felt like I wasn't getting anything important done, just wallowing in my own emotional response to art.
