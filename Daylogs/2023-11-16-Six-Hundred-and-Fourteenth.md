14:15.  If I just eat whenever I'm hungry, I feel eternally overfed, because the point at which I get hungry is *before* the point at which I stop feeling overfed.  There's this overlap space where I feel simultaneously hungry and overfed.  Different systems are both reporting.  There should be an anti-overlap space where I feel neither hungry *nor* overfed.
