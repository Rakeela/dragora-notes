11:02.  87,210 words of progress.

14:47.  87,210.  I have been SO.  FREAKING.  TIRED.  Today.  My body temperature has been fluctuating, judging by the wide range of colors that I've gotten on my mood ring, but whatever the mood ring has said, I've felt exhausted.  My morning was interrupted by bouts of unplanned sleep, and a forty minute task took hours.

17:40.  87,951.

17:42.  I finally got some work done.

22:07.  88,527.  1,310 words of progress.  I had to put some effort into studying how to write a good hypnovillain.
