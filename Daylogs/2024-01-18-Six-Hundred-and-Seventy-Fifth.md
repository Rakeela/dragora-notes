6:00.  I'm getting an earlier start today.  I'm going to start my day by buying a book where the gryphons are sapient fire elementals.

6:16.  Book ordered.

7:42.  Done Nationstates stuff.  Uh...  I'm procrastinating on starting writing.  Little more procrastinating.  Flight Rising.

10:04.  I did Flight Rising, then I played a round of The Viceroy where I ran the Panarchy Informalists and tried not to increase Wealth too much, populating the territory with a great many commonwealth citizens.

11:04.  I argued on 4chan for an hour.  Still procrastinating.  I guess it's time to get to work.

11:05.  It was weird to play The Viceroy earlier and implement natalism.  I tried to make a populous, low-Wealth zone.

11:06.  92,368.

11:29.  1,910 words of editing.  92,459.  91 words of progress.

12:40.  3,603 words of editing.  92,715.  347 words of progress.

13:04.  2,465 words of editing.  92,856.  488 words added.  'Of progress' is a silly way to insist on writing it, considering that the real progress here is my advance through the text in editing.  The additional writing is just a little thing.

13:19.  2,097 words of editing.  92,957.  589 words added.

15:08.  4,265 words of editing.  92,958.  590 words added.

20:23.  I ran my TTRPG session today.  It was... middling bad.  I made the mystery too complex and fed too many faulty clues in.  The heroes didn't find the right answer.

20:29.  14,340 words of editing.  Just tallied it up.  34 words of editing.  92,974.  606 words added.
