9:29.  I remember when I started naming my daylogs like this.  I was so sure I'd come up with better names eventually.  Anyways.  I've been up for a few hours, but I haven't hit up Nationstates yet.  Time for that.

10:58.  I skipped one of my nationstates tasks, the regular leader review for IC1.  Time to work on writing.  23,421.

12:42.  24,494.  1,073 words of progress.  Staaaaalled.

13:31.  24,885.  1,464 words of progress.  I broke the stall, but I'm not sure where I'm going with this bit.  I did some worldbuilding, but I'm not excited for what I'm showing off.

16:19.  25,495.

19:47.  27,043.  3,622 words of progress.
