Daily Nanowrimo update!  The book that I'm working on is starting out at 12,564 words.  Subtracting the preexisting 4,589 words, that means I've done 7,975 words of work this nanowrimo.  I've reported 8,107 words of work so far, for an anomaly not in my favor of 132 words.  Brr, I may have to exceed my quota by 132 words today.  I didn't actually exceed it yesterday, I just credited myself with the anomalous words, thinking that would correct it.  Why does the World Anvil site ALWAYS produce a word count anomaly?  It never seems to count words the way simple arithmetic would count words.  Every day, my word count is off from what I calculated the day before.

Anyways.  The file that I'm starting work on is at 2,801 words.  It's not quite done yet.

3,530 on the file.  That's 729 words of progress and 938 words to go.  I wish I could sprint like some writers can.

504 words into the next file.  434 words to go.

771...  167 words to go.

908...  Oh, that's frustrating.  30 words to go.

1,037 words.  Done!  That's 1,766 words done today.
