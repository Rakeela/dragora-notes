Morning weigh-in:  244.2 pounds

WARNING!  I took off my sweater for this weigh-in.  The weight is down by the weight of my sweater.  Wah!  I'm gaining weight again.

I'm reading a book titled "Atheopaganism" and it strikes me as irritating.  It's almost bigoted.  It treats religious people as inherently superstitious.  They're not.  It treats the world as declining into a dark age, and that just sounds like what I've heard from so many conservatives who think everything will decline if people don't think just like they do.  It treats religious thought as providing moral guidance to society that should be preserved in an atheist world.  That seems conservative, too.  This book comes across as atheist conservativism.  I don't like it.

I just watched an episode of Yu Yu Hakusho.  It seemed to take a long time.  That's what stood out to me.  I wasn't bored or anything.  I felt like I really had time to appreciate it.  More recent shows take the same amount of objective time to tell their stories, but somehow they seem to take less subjective time.  I'm not saying Yu Yu Hakusho is a classic or anything.  I just don't know why it seemed to have a different subjective time rate.

I'm not adhering to my diet today, but I think I'll do better in the future.  If I reject the sweet flavor itself, I should be fine.

9.0 miles, 1,132 kcal, 21,763 steps.  3 hours, 1 minute, 45 seconds.  Average speed 3 mph.  I've got the speed, but only a third of the endurance.  I ripped open my foot again.  More bleeding.  I can't walk for nine hours at 3 mph without injuring my feet.
