I am breaking my sugar-free conduct today.  I have bought dark chocolate caramel grahams as well as a tuxedo mousse cake.  I gorged myself on dark chocolate caramel grahams for breakfast!  Ah, I've missed sugar!

I'll try again on the sugarfree thing someday.  Next time I'm going to try something to reduce flatulence, but what, I'm not sure.  I bet it won't work the second time either, but I bet it'll work the third or fourth time I go after it.  I had three or four false starts on vegetarianism before I committed to it successfully - which is to say it was the fourth or fifth time that stuck.  I'm estimating that it'll take me slightly less time to figure out being sugarfree.

I think I would already have stuck with being sugarfree if the global sugar industry were distinctly unethical, but AFAIK sugar-growing is ethically okay.  It isn't tied up with major conflicts or corruptions, and sugar doesn't suffer when harvested.

Starting with 8,107 words on the file.  I need to bring this file to a close.  The chapter its in is overweight.  Lots of these chapters are overweight.  They'll need to be trimmed down and/or broken up.  I want 4k word chapters with occasional short chapters, not consistent heavy 7-9k chapters.

8,935 words on the file.  Finally closing the "chapter".  828 words of progress, 839 to go.  Once again I find myself drawn to mark my progress around the midpoint on the quota.

728 words on the new file.  Not enough.

966 words on the new file.  1,794 words of progress.  127 words over par, 206 words under 2k.  I need 1,172 words on the new file.

2,022 words on the new file.  2,850 words of progress.  1,183 words over par, 850 words over 2k.  I think I'm done for the day.
