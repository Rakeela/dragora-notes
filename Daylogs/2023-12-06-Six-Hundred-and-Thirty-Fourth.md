9:43.

11:13.  The blank timepoint is kind of just "when I first loaded up my timepoint tracking" and it means "I got up and loaded the timepoints reasonably promptly", at least this time.  I tend to get distracted the first time I try that.

11:14.  I want to play No Man's Sky, but I ought to write a bit first.  37,849.  Down one, because the first thing I'm doing is taking a word out.

11:39.  38,215.  366 words of progress.  Chapter completed.  I'm working on shorter chapters now.

12:10.  38,717.  868 words of progress.  I feel a little... eh.

13:34.  I have been trying to play No Man's Sky, but it's been crashing.

13:56.  Wow, the settlement construction mechanic is slow.  An hour between building phases, and I have to keep checking back on it.

14:00.  Settlement-building is very chill.  I can combine it with time-pointing to check in regularly and see how fast I can build.

14:20.  38,895.  1,046 words of progress.

15:07.  39,444.  1,595 words of progress.  I'm going to check in on my settlement.  My gek are building a bar.

16:31.  Did I spend that long in No Man's Sky?  My settlement got attacked by sentinels.  I'm playing in Permadeath, so it's fairly terrifying when the game springs a hard fight on me.

16:32.  I need to hit up the pharmacy.  I'm out of carbamazepine.  It seems to impact my psychotic symptoms, so I need to restock ASAP.

17:07.  Oh hey, time to start my next building construction in No Man's Sky.  And I'm restocked on carbamazepine!

17:22.  They're building a "hydro-silo" next.  It's a productive building.  It makes a lot of sense, they're on a desert planet.

18:46.  I fell asleep on the couch.  I was amazingly tired.  It felt so good to just lay down.  That was a little bit of paradise.  Better than usual sleep.  Also dreamless.  I was just laying there, thinking.  For over an hour.  Mm.

22:33.  39,467.  I haven't been working much... at all...  I just poked at it a bit.  Bleeeeh.  I think I would've been more productive if I'd put away my treadmill earlier, but at the same time now that I'm sitting down and considering writing I am *so restless*.

22:48.  39,517.  1,668 words of progress.  Well, that's...  literally exactly one word over quota...

22:49.  I'm stuck in a scene.  The chapter isn't long enough, but I don't know how to transition.

22:55.  I got distracted.  I looked again, and...  I'm still stuck.  The time I spent distracted wasn't time spent "thinking in the background" it was just time spent "not making progress".  Sometimes I doubt that "thinking in the background" is even a real phenomenon.

22:56.  I used to be 100% convinced that I was always simultaneously thinking of *several* things in the background, but...  I don't feel like that anymore.

23:32.  39,789.  1,940 words of progress.  That's a little better.  I'm going to turn it in and go to bed.

23:33.  45% of Meratep's Travelogue is complete!
