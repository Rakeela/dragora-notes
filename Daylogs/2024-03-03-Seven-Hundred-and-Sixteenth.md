20:21.  Ugh.  I haven't done anything productive today.

20:24.  I started writing a few minutes ago.  73,705.  73,724.

21:38.  74,102.

22:59.  74,267.  562 words of progress.  Not great.

23:02.  Ugh.  I've been suffering species dysphoria this evening.  I don't want to be human.  But I slightly don't even want to be a dragon.  I want to be an AI!
