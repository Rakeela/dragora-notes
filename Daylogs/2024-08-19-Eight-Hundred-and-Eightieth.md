10:48.  36,523.  I played Nationstates and Flight Rising this morning, now I'm getting to my writing.

16:48.  38,717.  I've been working pretty hard today!  I'm going to take a break.

20:58.  39,480.  I don't remember how long a break I took.  I'm going to estimate that it was an hour.

(This part added the next day.)  10.8 miles.  1,879 kcal.  38,914 steps.  8 hours, 18 minutes, and 23 seconds.  I couldn't get the average speed, since the treadmill crashed when I ended the session, but it was probably 1.1 or 1.2 mph.  2,957 words of progress.
