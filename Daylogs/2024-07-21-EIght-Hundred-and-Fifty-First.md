10:12.  I am watching a video featuring a woman wearing a big white chest ruff on otherwise modern attire.  It looks like she has a big white beard.  A ragged one, too.

14:46.  I have been thinking about the subjective experience of bigotry.  I dislike dishonest characters.  When a character is dishonest, I tend to disprefer the media that they're in.  A media piece that is constantly expressing dishonesty is unlikely to appeal to me.

14:48.  Veggie-brats off the grill.  Yum.  I think my reaction to dishonest characters is similar to a bigot's reaction to the target of their bigotry.

14:50.  What I feel is a desire to erase dishonesty and create a media "innocent" of it.  I use this term "innocent" to parallel what I perceive to be the thoughts of people who hate LGBT representation.  They see such representation as a violation of "innocence", and they prefer "innocent" media where LGBT people don't exist.

14:51.  Likewise, I prefer "innocent" media where the thing I'm averse to (dishonesty) just doesn't exist.

14:54.  When media upsets me by having extremely dishonest characters - even as villains! - 

15:27.  Credit 160 words edited.  92,063 words of progress.

15:30.  Credit 45 words edited.  When media upsets me by having extremely dishonest characters, I am left with some amount of lingering upset.  I know that there's a sea of normalcy in which I can retreat, that most people even in fiction aren't like that, and so I withdraw.

22:52.  92,399.

22:59.  Aside from like two hours reading a book (Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit), literally everything I did today was simultaneous with writing work.  I finally lost steam in the evening.  I mean, assuming I even had steam at all.  Editing is still hard.  I get no flow.

23:02.  2,867 words edited, tallied.  951 words written.

23:08.  I'm on Chapter 10 of Greeve's Ambition.  Ugh.  This is so slow.
