This morning is oddly terrible.  Nothing in particular seems to be wrong, yet everything seems to be wrong.  I just feel awful.  My eyes are teary, even.  I found myself thinking, if Heaven existed, would random bad mornings exist in Heaven?  I concluded that they would.  Random bad mornings are related to who I am, not who anyone else is, and they don't seem to be the result of anyone's sin.

Not that I'm fixated on sin or anything!  I'm just morbid.  Being otherkin inclines me to believe in some amount of spirit, even though I have no religion and am otherwise materialist.  I went through a lot of good and bad in another lifetime, so it seems.  I often wonder what will happen to me in the lifetime after this one.  I tend to think there'll be some kind of Heaven for me, but given my experiences it's more likely that I'll have yet another lifetime in a (relatively) mundane and flawed world.

Anyway.  Putting on my favorite sweater helped me feel better about the morning.

Reading books feels so much more accomplishing than other modes of leisure activity.  If I eat a great deal, I feel like I have done harm to myself.  If I play a great deal of a game, I rarely feel I have gained anything from it.
