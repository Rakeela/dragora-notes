10:48.  I feel depressed.  It's not real all-day depression (probably); I'll get over it in a couple of hours at worst.  But right now, I don't feel like doing *anything*...

15:31.  I'm still demoralized.

15:34.  113,460.  I guess I should start to work.  I'll feel better if I can focus.  If.

17:39.  113,918.  Was that two hours?  This writing is difficult.  I needed ginger tea earlier; I had a stomachache that was interfering with my ability to work.

18:38.  114,300.  840 words of progress.  Important progress, but not a lot of it.

20:25.  114,938.  1,478 words of progress.  I'm working on a scene that players might not even see.
