I'm not doing any treadmill walking at all today.  Not even a little.  My foot needs time to heal.  It really does look like the skin tore.

I'm still reading Atheopaganism.  It grinds my gears.  I don't like this book at all.  This guy sees such a dark world ahead.  He speaks of a resurgence of faith and superstition.  I don't see it.  I see religion in a generational decline.  This guy's dark age theory is something I consider conservative psychology.  I just don't see a remedy to this posited social decay as necessary to enact.  The decay is ephemeral.  Society is progressing.

I've gotten into the rituals section of the book, and...  I hate this stuff.  I'm glad I don't have to bother with it.  It sounds primitive and meaningless.  I wouldn't want to do these pagan rituals.  They remind me of social experiences that hurt, where I was pushed against my limits and pressured into positions where I didn't know how not to be rude.

I finished Atheopaganism.  There's a storm cloud, and there's a silver lining.  The storm cloud was that I didn't enjoy that book at all.  I pushed myself to read through it quickly just to get it over with.  The silver lining was that I felt driven to take notes while reading it.  Recording my experiences during the read made it easy and satisfying to write the negative review I left for it on Goodreads.

The full title of the book is "Atheopaganism: An Earth-honoring path rooted in science" and I've given it a link in my bibliography here:  [[Atheopaganism-An-Earth-Honoring-Path-Rooted-in-Science]].

My motivation to write has been null lately.  Sure, I tapped out some ideas for the economic simulator that Kistaro now wants to cooperate with me in making, and I've now got 79 event ideas for the game.  That's writing.  Kistaro thinks it is.  Yet I haven't advanced my stories at all.

I feel like doubling my gabapentin dose to chase away morbidity did damage to my drive to write.  I'm less morbid now!  I'm still kinda depressed, and now I haven't been writing.  I was putting all that into exercise, but my foot is injured, so I can't.  I don't have an excuse for sitting here and reading all day.

At least I'm fasting again today.  I bought another bag full of candy, but I haven't eaten any of it.  My current fast is 17 hours old, not counting three energy drinks and some cream.  I don't count the cream.  It's pure dairy fat and it can't cause an insulin response.  Honestly, I'm in a pretty good position relative to weight loss objectives.  I weigh 242.5 pounds right now (midday) despite that I was eating from Saturday through Tuesday.  I should still have several pounds of glycogen weight to shed, and then I'll be under 240.  My weight loss progress got delayed by several weeks, but it'll pick up again.

I miss cannabis.

I'm running low on amino acid pills.  I feel like I need to pick up more.  I seem to get better weight loss results if I take these.  The catch is, I only discovered these during the closing sale at Pharmaca.  I don't know where to find more.  All the vitamin shops have been closing.  I kinda didn't wish them well, feeling like they were preying on ignorance in selling products that didn't work, but now I've found a supplement that I like.  I'm not aware of any specific reason to believe I have amino acid deficiencies, but these amino acid pills are the greatest horsepills I've ever taken.  Each pill is one very dry gram of protein.  The instructions say to take them three at a time.

I can't really see any equivalent to them on the shelves.  There's one remaining vitamin shop on the other side of town.  I could try going there.

I'm reading another book called Black Angel, by Kyell Gold.  I had this one for a while intending to read it, but I never cracked the cover before today.  I read a bit of the first page and was hooked when the author said, "Course, otters have the lowest rate of violent crime of any of the major species in this country, and you can look that shit up on the internet," which completely shocked me.  The author went there!  Racism in a furry setting.

Now, on page 18, there's a great description of a back wall cluttered with artifacts.  On page 33, there's a description of a building facade.  I want to record these.  There's also mentions of otters and pools.  The characters have seasons, and it's normal.  I love these glimpses into the world of another species.
