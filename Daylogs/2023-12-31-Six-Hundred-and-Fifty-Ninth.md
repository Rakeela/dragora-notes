6:34.  Insomnia.  I gave up sleeping maybe an hour ago, and since I'm still wide awake, I'm just staying up for the day.

6:40.  80,984.

6:55.  81,077.  I started early because I had a modification that I immediately wanted to make to the test, but now I've come up with the idea of including poetry in the book, and I'm not sure about it.

18:21.  81,381.  I mostly haven't been working on the material, though I did think about it.

21:39.  83,047.  2,063 words of progress.

23:52.  It's weird to think I'm only a few thousand words from finishing the first draft of Meratep's Travelogue
