If they actually break transmission chains, masks could be argued as a form of long-term investment in economic productivity.  Lost productivity due to disease is real.  If only masks could extirpate diseases, the argument would be strong enough to believe in!  Alas, I expect minor productivity increases to be overmatched by the costs of the masks themselves, and the masks aren't good enough to extirpate diseases.

We need continued investment in RNA vaccine development.  That technology is good enough to extirpate diseases.  Just as early vaccines lead to early vaccine extirpation, RNA vaccines need to prove themselves for the history books by extinguishing diseases.  The most truly efficient vaccination campaigns are eventually no longer needed, for they meet their objectives!

Disease eradication is in a special category of major expense for that if successful it self-eliminates as an expense.  Programs that achieve their ends and then have no further expenses are true investments.

This is one of my motivations for wanting to become an immunologist.  I feel like the full potential of RNA vaccination is going under-realized and is likely to remain under-realized.  I want to learn what I need in order to start devising RNA vaccines so that I can help the technology achieve a fuller utilization!

Our society's thoughts of Health are too tied up with the obesity rate.  I don't care about the obesity rate.  I want to see fat people with no fear of disease.

Rejuvenation should be the goal, anyways.  People given back their youth will burst with vitality and try new paths in life, which should start eroding the obesity rate without specific anti-obesity policy.

I do think I know something about what's going on with the worldwide increasing trends in obesity.

First off, a protest.  People are too rude!  They are subtly rude or blatantly rude, and while these are usually different populations, both are problems.  The subtly rude people think they're being polite, but they still spread misery.  It's not about the words people use; it's about whether they're being hateful.  I know someone who cusses plenty that I wouldn't call rude, because he doesn't seem to mean any harm, but merely to find his chosen vocabulary funny.  I find it funny, too.  Rudeness is about the actual attitudes people have towards others.  Rudeness is unempathetic.  The subtly rude and blatantly rude people are united by a shared tendency towards hatred.  They want others to suffer and/or they have a sociopath's uncaring willingness to violate others.  Why do I put this protest here?  Our society is splintered apart by hostilities!  Stress and misery then make people resort to eating, which makes them fatter.

To actually get into mechanics, famine makes people skinnier (but it favors fat genes).  We're currently in a period of abundance, which makes people fatter (but it favors skinny genes).  Historically, humanity has teetered near a state of famine since agricultural development began and presumably before.  Hunter-gatherers had little surplus.  This historically universal tendency towards famine has created a very strong and widespread legacy of fat-storing genes.

Agriculture is where human technology started, but with constant famines it's like humanity wasn't in an agrarian-competent state.  Humanity started with neither intensive development of agriculture nor a deep respect for the peasantry.  To liken this to The Viceroy, which still shows up in my thoughts pretty often, it's like humanity didn't start with the Commonwealth or the Empire, but grew through Panarchic agrarianism at low Wealth levels.

Now that we're no longer in Panarchic agrarianism, but have developed a more competent agrarian state through specialized industrial agriculture (Imperial agriculture), we're in a state of abundance.  This should be favoring thin-metabolism genes.  Yet it's going to take a long time to get thin like this.  I'm not sure it'll ever work.  People alive today definitely won't live to see it work.

There IS an alternative to waiting for evolutionary forces to correct humanity's history of famine.  If people seriously want to lower the obesity rate, they should canvas the entire public to find people who are both thin and sedentary, then research them to figure out what's special about the genes for their metabolism.  Once the right gene targets have been identified, offer their genomes as gene therapies to the world.  Sedentary lifestyles aren't going away; let's genetically optimize for them!

A comical note: since their tech trees are bad with agriculture and they don't have the specialist advantage with it, the Panarchy should be The Fat Ones in The Viceroy.  Their societies have a tendency towards high food prices due to food importing and their Wealth is stereotypically limited by their ability to produce food.  This tendency favors fat genes and suggests that they tend to grow fatter over time and with Wealth.

If only they respected and empowered the peasantry as the Commonwealth does, or invested heavily in industrial agricultural technologies as the Empire does, the Panarchy would have a tendency to grow thinner.  Yet they do not.

If I overcome my disabilities, I may someday still write a book about that game.

I arrive too early every morning for my Intro to Organic Chemistry class.  Ordinarily, I read a book while waiting for class to start.  Today, I decided to spend the extra time journalling.
