12:34.  Time is slipping past.  I haven't done much productive today.

12:51.  I've updated my word counts on the million wordcount challenge that Vale ran this year.  The challenge is at 77.66% completed with 776,585 words.

12:53.  2,460 words on Meratep's Travelogue.

15:16.  3,353.  893 words of progress.  I'm aiming for a target of 1,269.  More is better.

16:51.  4,171.  1,711 words of progress.

20:57.  I stopped working quite a while ago.

23:19.  When I said I stopped working a while ago, I started working.  5,575.  3,115 words of progress.  I feel more alert than I felt most of the day, but it's still time for bed.  I better turn in my word count.

23:20.  7.9 miles.  1,448 kcal.  30,209 steps.  6 hours, 41 minutes, 6 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.  I also walked approximately 35 additional minutes at this speed, but I witlessly closed the session.
