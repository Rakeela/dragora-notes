8:40.  I'm amazed at how much time I can spend doing nothing of note in the mornings.  It's been 65 minutes since I got out of bed.  I do much worse than this some mornings.  48,698.

10:10.  I haven't done any work.  48,698.

10:33.  48,802.  Going to go get something to eat.

11:47.  I got back a while ago, but I have been pulling a hard nothing for inspiration.

13:05.  49,013.  I've been mostly working on a minor writing project where I'm collaborating with a friend, so I haven't gotten a lot done on Meratep's Travelogue so far.

15:45.  49,013.  I played No Man's Sky for a while.  I feel totally uninspired in my current chapter of Meratep's Travelogue.  My mind is starting to writhe to look for new possibilities.

18:42.  50,984.  1,971 words of progress.  Wait, miscalculation.  2,286 words of progress.

19:04.  50,984.  I've been distracted by dinosaur lore.  And...  A bit lacking in confidence.  Is this really good material?  Tomorrow, my confidence will be somewhat restored, and I'll be able to make more progress.

(This part added the next day.)  2.3 miles.  379 kcal.  8,198 steps.  1 hour, 34 minutes, 54 seconds.  My exercising was interrupted by sudden extreme muscle pain in my back... while I was urinating... and then I put the treadmill away, because I was somewhat less mobile.  Writing this at 13:35 the next day, it still hurts.
