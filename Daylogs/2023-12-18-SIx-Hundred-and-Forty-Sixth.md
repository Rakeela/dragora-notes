13:13.  57,993.  I'm kinda stymied on my writing.  Not sure what to write next.

22:00.  59,928.  1,935.  I've been kinda erratically writing, doing other things, coming back to writing, getting distracted, coming back to writing...  It's been a very at-ease day and I haven't worried about my word count at all.  I didn't do all the wordcount at the end this time either, but I worked a bit on the previous chapter, too.  The result was kind of okay, but not impressive.  I mean, for wordcount.
