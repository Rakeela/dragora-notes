7:50.  I woke up at 5:30, and got up at 6:30.  I didn't lay in bed for a whole hour.  It was more that I laid back down briefly and fell right back to sleep for almost exactly an hour.  Since then, I've breakfasted, read a few pages of my recent new age book, and done a little bit of editing.

7:55.  Credit 154 words of editing to Kura and Kaire.

10:29.  Internet outage.  Kistaro warned me this would happen.  I didn't work for long earlier, but mostly hung out on Nationstates until the internet went out.  I promoted efficient governance to a talkative fascist player with a confiscatory nation full of death camps.  They seemed a bit dumb.  Now I'm trying to load Steam.  It's having trouble due to the lack of internet connectivity, but hopefully it will eventually ask me if I want to start up in offline mode.  I'd like to play a bit more of that climate change game.
