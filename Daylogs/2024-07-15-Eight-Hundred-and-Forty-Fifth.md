6:51.  Just got up.  I woke up on the dot at 6:30, and...  Well, I was out of bed at 6:38, but somehow I don't feel like I've done anything yet.  I just caught up on my favorite discord server.  That's what I think ate the time between 6:38 and 6:51.

6:52.  86,143.  I think I'm going to start by rewriting a scene, so there'll be some editing credits, and maybe some writing credits.  First up, the length of the scene I'm replacing...  Credit 388 words edited.

8:56.  After working very briefly, I stopped to play Nationstates.  I'm now caught up on all of my nations.  Astonishingly, that seems to be positive for my daily productivity, though I was a little frustrated at myself for abandoning work after barely beginning.  Two hours!  That cost two hours. 

13:55.  88,921.  Good progress!  I fixed something that was tell-y.

16:46.  I haven't made further progress.  I bemoaned my plotting to Kistaro around 14:45-14:55, and we had a good conversation on what I could do next, but I'm still stymied.

16:50.  Wow, was that four minutes?  I felt like I just looked over at Discord for a moment, and when I looked back again four minutes had passed in the blink of an eye!  Well, I bought something I shouldn't have, which was a bottle of my favorite kind of amaretto liquor.

16:51.  See, amaretto can be bad, in which case I have no interest in it, or it can be good, in which case it's terribly delicious.  If it's terribly delicious, it's hard to drink it moderately.  I haven't felt drunk at any point, but I'm going through the bottle of amaretto disquietingly quickly.  I am drinking at the pace of my liver, rather than at a proper, healthy moderation.

16:52.  I also bought some absinthe.  I see nothing regrettable about it.  I have wanted to try it for a long time, but I have never seen it in a store.  It even has wormwood in it.  Wormwood!  It's pretty tasty, but the flavor is very in-your-face.  It's intense.   I think it'll take a while for me to drink through my supply of absinthe.

16:53.  To be clear, I don't think wormwood is what makes absinthe's taste in-your-face.  I do not know if wormwood has a distinct flavor.  It's just a traditional (and toxic) inclusion in absinthe.

18:04.  90,256.  4,113 words of progress.  Draft complete!
