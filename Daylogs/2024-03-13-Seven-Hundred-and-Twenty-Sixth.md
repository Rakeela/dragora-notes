8:07.  29,363.

12:15.  31,506.  2,143 words of progress.  Making good headway!  I'm taking a little break.

12:30.  31,513.  Back to work.

12:53.  31,750.  2,387 words of progress.

13:17.  31,992.  2,629 words of progress.  It's not really flowing.

14:36.  32,580.  3,217 words of progress.

14:56.  32,640.  3,277 words of progress.  Staaaaaalled.  I've got to write romantic content now.  What a pain.

16:14.  33,118.  3,755 words of progress.  Stalled again.  I broke one stall and I'm struggling.  I don't know what I'm doing with this phase of the story.  Continued effort eventually breaks stalls... but I'm going to take a risk and take a break again.

17:53.  Ugh.  That took a while, and I resent the need to get back to work.  I'm going to go play The Viceroy.  It seems to affect things it shouldn't, and I want to bend the Commonwealth towards justice, as the voices in my head tell me it has a pigheaded will to tyrannize people and refuse them the justice and liberty which is the essence of Commonwealth values.

22:58.  Whew, it's late.  I completed another run of The Viceroy, took some notes, showered, and then...  I dunno.  Lazed around not doing much for an hour.  I downed an energy drink in that time.  It felt so good.  I just love drinking those things at the wrong hour.  It's so pleasurable, and it doesn't seem to actually hurt me.  They help me in the morning, but they don't feel anywhere close to as good.  If I had more willpower, it might be hedonically optimal for me to drink one energy drink in the morning, and one energy drink in the evening.

23:04.  33,111.  Trimmed something.

24:03.  33,907.  Whoops, midnight caught me off-guard.  The '24:03' notation should represent ably exactly when I noticed I was over the day mark.  I'll credit everything I've written so far and count the day complete!  4,544 words of progress.
