10:53.  

15:25.  Oh, I didn't write down a starting wordcount earlier.  84,177.  Current talley, 84,510.  Today has not been highly productive.  I've been distracted.

20:00.  Ugh.  I caught up on my Nationstates backlog today... most of it.

21:27.  What a dismally unproductive day.  85,005.

(This part added the next day.)  I didn't exercise on my treadmill yesterday, but I did write a bit more than I recorded.  I ended on 85,136 words.  959 words of progress for the day.
