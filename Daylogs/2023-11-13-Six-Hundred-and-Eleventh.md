8:34.  I've been awake for two hours, but I'm such a zombie this morning.  I've been thinking about my story, though incapable of putting anything to the text.  I think I'm going to commit a minor sin against Nanowrimo by stepping back in the text to a spot I thought I might want to expand later, and expanding on that.  This is in contrast to normal practices, which extend only the end.  37,073.

8:35.  I'm still off of sweets.

11:53.  38,841.  1,804 words of progress.  That's quota!  I got it done early today.  I'm going to celebrate by picking something tasty up from the store.  Baked pea snacks are one of my favorite things to eat lately.

12:49.  The pea snacks were all sold out!  Happy day, this means they'll be profitable enough to stay in stock.  I bought onion and okra snacks instead.  I also bought myself a lentil wrap, as well as a butternut squash and onion tart.  That looks delicious and I've heated it up promptly.

12:50.  The lentil wrap was also wonderful.  I almost bought a tuna wrap, but I hesitated.  Tuna fishing is not as environmentally friendly as lentil farming.

18:06.  So I was stymied until...  *checks chat records.*  16:30. I've been working since then.

18:09.  39,626.  2,553 words of progress.

19:11.  40,205.  3,132 words of progress.

19:14.  40,225.  3,152 words of progress.  I meant to stop, but I thought of something vital.

22:56.  I finished reading an important book!  It was a draft copy of a book being authored by a fellow author.  And it was really, really good!

22:57.  13.8 miles.  2,523 kcal.  51,112 steps.  11 hours, 39 minutes, and 3 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.
