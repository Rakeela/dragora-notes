I wish we didn't have this pandemic going on.  There's good research potential in tolerogenic dendritic cells.  People can suffer acquired autoreactivities that seriously damage their life's potential.  Sufferers of PANDAS, for instance, have a problem that tolerogenic dendritic cell treatments might be able to solve.  This is caused by the superantigenic properties of the streptococcus bacteria, which confuse the immune system and make acquired self-reactivities likely.

I wonder if it would be possible to vaccinate infants against PANDAS by using an [[RNA-Vaccines]] to give them a competent antigen to the streptococcus bacteria.  If the immune system's initial response were more competent, acquired autoreactivity would be less likely.
