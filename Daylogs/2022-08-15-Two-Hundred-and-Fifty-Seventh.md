I have lately started making something based on the lore of Cultist Simulator which profoundly overthinks Theoma's magic lore.  It's founded on the ascendant path that some (not all) mages in the setting follow: it's possible to become a land god, and land gods are truly, profoundly immortal creatures who create wonders at will.  This mirrors the ascension path in Cultist Simulator so well that I keep wondering if it would make a good total conversion mod.

There are two chief difficulties I have encountered so far.
Difficulty the First:  There is no Knock-equivalent in Theoma.  The mages do not summon otherworldly things.  They also do not explode doors.  Nor do they worship wounds, nor serpents, though I would be willing to add serpent worship just for fun.  Snakes are cute!  I am for the moment simply keeping Knock, but I don't know if that will stand.
Difficulty the Second:  There is no veneration of particular individuals in the magic lore I have built up so far, but there is a LOT of veneration of particular individuals in the lore of Cultist Simulator.  The Names and Hours that populate the Mansus have no equivalent in Theoma.  These venerations are UBIQUITOUS in Cultist Simulator's lore and they are hard to replace.  I may need to do more worldbuilding to add more signposts to the path of becoming a land god.

There is also no Mansus in Theoma, and I am loathe to add one.

I have so far replaced the cycle of Moth-Lantern-Forge-Edge-Winter-Heart-Grail with a cycle of Hydra-Chime-Cabinet-Rift-Dissolution-Garden-Chains.  Of these, Chime is so weak it is struggling to revert to Lantern, and Cabinet is too comical to be my final name for that principle.  Although I did love Kistaro's description of cabinets as complicated aesthetic creations, and it fell in line with my thoughts of how on Theoma, the Rifts are driven by conflicting aesthetic planning.  Without life and death on the line, the question of what is beautiful really holds a lot of weight in eternity on Theoma.  The fine designs of Cabinet (or whatever I call this principle) are subverted by Rift as people move apart over an inevitability of many small disagreements.

I consider two principles "shattered" in Theoma.  The Grail and Winter are not merely replaced, but rejected.  They are the shattered principles in my setting.  They are birth and endings, respectively.  There are births on Theoma and there are deaths on Theoma, but there are so few that they are not occult principles so much as mishaps.  That said, the replacement principles of Dissolution and Chains respectively do govern a disproportionate share of deaths and births respectively.

I dreamed last night of many things.  One I will gladly forget (it was merely the dream of playing an ugly game), but one of them was pretty awesome.  I argued with "a goddess" about the worth of immortality.  She argued that immortals would grow bored and twisted.  I argued that they would not.  In the dream, she gifted me a planet to prove my case, though I did not get into the business of influencing that planet in the dream itself, but woke remembering the dream.
