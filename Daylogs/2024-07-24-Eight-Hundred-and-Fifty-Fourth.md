10:25.  Credit 56 words editing.  I'm too fixated on these Helluva Boss commentaries, and I'm not effectively using them as focus aids.

10:26.  They're solidly distracting me.

10:29.  This guy says he had two exes like Stolas, and I can see how it could happen.  Stolas is such a recognizable evil character!  And there are so many people who can't see it.  I love Stolas, but I want to see his character handled correctly.
