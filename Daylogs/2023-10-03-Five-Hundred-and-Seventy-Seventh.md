14:35.  I got struck by an easy, relaxed, comfortable, unambitious sort of feeling this morning.  I just didn't feel like I needed to do anything in particular.  It lasted for hours.  I felt okay.  I still kind of feel that way.  I'm just running out of things I'd rather do more than write, so I worked my way back around to writing despite a total lack of drive.  60,158.

14:45.  60,274.  Chapter complete.

15:11.  Bleh, I don't know what to write next.  I can't seem to get sustained productivity anymore.  Fits and starts, only.  Playing games doesn't help me think.  I'll just try laying on the couch... though this has low odds, too.

17:32.  I have drunk an unusual quantity of alcohol, in the form of something with about the potency of fortified wine.  I'm not really feeling it.  I drank it in three stages, each time feeling like I wasn't really feeling it.  I really want to feel it this time.  I can feel it a little bit, now.
