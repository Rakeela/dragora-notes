All I can do is read books and fail at stuff.  I've been shy of clarifying just how depressive I am.  As though to go through my feelings in detail would give power to evil, that's how I feel.  It's a terrible, restrictive emotional mindset, and it's killing my creativity.

I just broke my shift key while picking at my keyboard to try to get hair out of it.  I talked to Kistaro about what happened and zie gave me a different keyboard with an intact shift key.  Kistaro says trying to pull hair out of the keyboard is normal, but I disagree.  I shouldn't have been picking at my keyboard, but I'm in an emotionally weird mood. 

I'm kind of frustrated that double-spacing sentences isn't considered normal.  I picked up that habit early on and I wish the world corresponded to my arbitrary preference for it.  There's a lot of word-processing software that misbehaves occasionally when double-spaces are used for sentences.  Obsidian, where I take my personal notes, is one of them.

I need to be studying math, but I just spent an hour studying the wiki for a strategy game that I've never played.  That was a depressive action.  If I weren't demoralized, I wouldn't be wasting as much time.  I seek constant escapism to overcome pain and stress caused by autoimmune conditions.  I wonder sometimes if I'd be better off dead.  The wretchedness of my perspective intensifies my self-restriction as I don't want to dispirit anyone else.

I'm lonely.  I need to work on my art (my writing) to evade loneliness and achieve socially competent self-expression that doesn't dispirit people.  Yet my bleak feelings themselves are inhibiting my self-expression.  What can I do to feel better?

For that matter, how can I tune my art so that it expresses what I need it to express?  Theoma is a bright setting that I long to live in.  Would I prefer to include more sadness in it?  I want to get away from sadness!  So why don't I feel more like reading what I've already written?

Why don't I reread the books that took me away from feeling terrible for a while?  I don't know why I'm not doing that.

I need to be studying math, and I'm too exhausted to do that or anything else.  I just want to lie flat and wait for death.
