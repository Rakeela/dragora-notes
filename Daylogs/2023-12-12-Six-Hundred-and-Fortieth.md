#2023-12-12-Six-Hundred-and-Fortieth

13:40.  I forgot to mark when I started work, so I'll use yesterday's tally.  50,984.  51,138.

15:00.

17:31.  51,502.  Total.  Inspiration.  Drain.  I can't think of anything new.  I can't figure out what I was going to do.

18:53.  51,733.  749 words of progress.  Today has been subjectively short.  That's frustrating.  Time has been going by quickly, and I've been moving/thinking slowly.

22:10.  51,891.  I wrote something boring.  It was a grind to get that out.

22:51.  52,039.  Oh my god, progress is like treacle.  1,055 words of progress.
