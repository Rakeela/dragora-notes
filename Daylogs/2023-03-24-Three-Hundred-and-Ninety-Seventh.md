Morning weigh-in:  241.6 pounds

My diet has been irregular this week, but my weight isn't terrible.  If I continue dieting through the weekend, I should make progress into next week.  Can I actually do it this week?  I don't know.

I have a foot injury that has impaired my treadmill use today.  A hole wore through my sock the day before yesterday, and the treadmill hurt my exposed foot.  I rested yesterday, but today it still hurts.

I ate a falafel wrap.  Otherwise, I've only eaten nuts.  This is keeping to my diet.  It's so hard today.  I took some exogenous ketones hoping for a pick-me-up, but my emotional state is still catastrophic.

(Added the following day)  7.6 miles, 1,130 kcal, 22,645 steps.  4 hours, 5 minutes, and 51 seconds.  Average speed 1.8 mph.  I just got too restless sitting around without walking.
