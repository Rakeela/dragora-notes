I'm walking slowly today.  I've just accidentally hit the stop button twice on my treadmill, so I have to make an early record of how much I walked, in order to combine the totals.

8,960 steps.  436 kcal.  2.4 miles.  Average speed 1.2 mph.  1 hour, 58 minutes, 39 seconds.

0.7 miles, 138 kcal, 2,760 steps.  37 minutes, 12 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.

I wore out today...  I kept being drawn back to the couch, and I eventually fell asleep there.  Why can't I work on Ekis' Travelogue?  I had this great new idea for a fourth book in the series.  What if it's Taltios' Travelogue, and Taltios has a personality of a natural teacher?  Taltios is given as a farmer, but maybe zie's also very wise.

I'm reading yet another book that commits one of the cardinal sins of dragon writing: it makes dragons hover.  Hovering flight is really stupidly hard and dragons shouldn't be able to do it.  Despite that, I'm enjoying the book, it just hit one of my pet peeve.
