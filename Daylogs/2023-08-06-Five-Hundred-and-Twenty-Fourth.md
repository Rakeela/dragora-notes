9:37.  I have done with morning stuff after a mere three hours, and I am still having trouble getting started.  I am going to go play a game for a bit, but I'm making this time point just to try to get myself to work a little faster.  I will make another time point when I come back!

9:55.  I am back!  4,964 words on the file.

10:33.  5,471 words on the file.  1,707 words on the chapter.

11:10.  6,106 words on the file.  2,342 words on the chapter.  I think that's chapter complete.

11:54.  6,512.  I took a break of unspecified duration since the last time point.

12:05.  6,694.  Taking another break to fetch something from the store.

13:18.  I am back.  I was delayed by reading a book.  It is a terrible, pre-scientific book despite being modern.  I am glad that society still has room for such people even as room temperature superconductors are being invented.

17:57.  I just spent way too long playing Bombe.  I'm getting better at it, but I'm getting addicted.  Both facts scare me.  I went in trying new things with variables today, but I also neglected a friend who asked for me to give them fifteen minutes of undivided attention.  I don't feel like I'm thinking differently, yet I clearly am.

18:25.  I hit nine hours on my treadmill twelve minutes ago.  Time to put it away.

18:26.  People around me encouraged me not to be concerned, but I'm still ashamed that I neglected someone like that.

18:38.  Paralyzing.  I bought them a gift, and I still can't think of anything else.

18:39.  This kind of highlights a problem with the new age book I've been reading.  It's all about claiming love, compassion, and happiness are one force.  I'm not convinced.  Feeling sad because I mistreated someone is only two out of the three.  Doing what made me happy in the moment was only one out of the three.  If I'd then been able to tear away from something that made me happy, I wouldn't be unhappy now.  I would've been more stressed at that moment, but it would've been worth it.

18:42.  I want to be better at Bombe, but I don't want it more than I want to be a good friend.

18:47.  All I can think is a desire for distraction from this feeling, but I feel like that would be unworthy, so I haven't done it.

18:51.  I'm concerned about something else today, too.  I'm a discovery writer.  I don't feel like I can 'discover' a war in Greeve's Ambition.  I have to.  Dymil and Greeve don't come to conflict in this novel, but they both expand during it.  They may discover each other by the end of the novel.  I have to discover how that happens.  I feel unworthy and incapable.

18:58.  Paralyzed.  Time is passing and I can't do anything.  I'm stressed.

19:03.  I feel like I should play Cultist Simulator just to get my mind moving again.  I could paint with an Edge essence, reassuring myself that I can find Edge if I need it, as I need it, and make productive use of it.

19:14.  Paralyzed.  Growing tired.  Maybe I should lay down.  I know I should work on my writing.

19:18.  Why do I need to play Cultist Simulator?  I can imagine it perfectly well.    You get the level 10 Edge influence from the Ascent of Knives.  You combine it to the level 15 Edge influence.  And then you paint.  Constantly.  That keeps the influence alive and in play.  Paintings of war, and the conditions that lead to it, and the people who engage in it.

19:21.  What good does it do me to play a game about something I can imagine?  It entrains my thoughts, somehow, in a way that just thinking about doing it does not.  There's a regularity that shapes the longing and extends it in time.

19:35.  It's weird how the drive to eat worms its way into all forms of misery.  I don't need food right now.

21:52.  7,196 words on the file.  2,232 words of progress.

22:13.  7,558.  2,594 words of progress.
