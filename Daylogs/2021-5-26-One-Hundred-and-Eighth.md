I was not a good fit for Puzzlebox.  I do believe in machine-assisted free will as a (potentially) real form of free will, but I didn't like the dubious consensuality of PBX.  Strangevirus had this atmospheric aspect to it; it did not give the impression of guided hostility to the consent of others so much as it gave me the impression of being an environmental hazard that was incidentally bad for mental health.  It struck me as a protector relative to the threats in the other Warps.

I was subject in public schooling to the presumption that all motives reduce to sex.  I was once mocked in front of the class for arguing that non-sexual culture was real.  I did my best to obey, but it was awful.  My sex life was marked by complaints about the difficulty of sex life.  I complained about stress and "performance anxiety".  Since I'd always been treated as so lustful that I had no right to say I wasn't lustful, I didn't have the words to say, "I don't want to perform in this way for these people."

I'm not in that environment anymore, but that's the environment which stalked me when I tried to defend my right of consent.  That's the environment which pursued me to punish me for "lying" about my sexual history, which pursued me to punish me for "lying" about... not being a sex object.  I wasn't ever supposed to be anything but lustful.  I was always supposed to agree that all motives reduce to sex.

Being anything other than a robotic replicant seeking sexual opportunity was treated as dishonesty.

[[the-ethical-slut]] reinforced to me that sex-positivity isn't about that.  I wish I'd read it when I was 11.  What happened to me wasn't liberal.  It wasn't liberated or liberating!  That's why I prefer liberalism to natalism.

But I'm still depressed.  I still feel like I'm fighting a spiritual battle against irrational rape-bot psuedoliberals who hate me for not wanting sex as much as they dictated I was to want sex.  Who hate me for being born male and being therefore a revolting whore who doesn't truly want anything but sex.  I don't want sex *at all*.  Sex was hard to get in the hard-to-comprehend sense.  It was emotionally unpleasant!  I love Kistaro for never pressuring me sexually!
