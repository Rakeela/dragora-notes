12:06.  Credit 292 words edited on Kura and Kaire.

12:22.  30,711.  1,571 words on the chapter.  I'm going to head across town to pick up caffeinated beverages for myself.

13:36.  I bought a sandwich (wrap) instead of caffeinated beverages.  I still resent the local caffeinated beverage vendor so much that I don't want to buy from them, and I also don't want to haul in the pricier ones from across town.

15:50.  30,717.  I have... null inspiration today.

17:20.  31,379.  836 words of progress.  I'm grinding through a scene that bothers me.  I'm so disappointed by it.  The characterization is indistinct.  I only just managed to bring the plot together.  A character is being a threshold guardian now?  

17:33.  31,551.  1,008 words of progress.  This character is SUCH a threshold guardian.  But I don't know how Taltios should react.  I don't know if Taltios should accept the warning or reject it.

18:16.  I played Cultist Simulator for a while.  I wasn't sure I'd ever play it again.  It's one of the inspirations for Theoma.  I wanted it to help guide me.  Does Taltios get pulled back at the threshold, or does he burst onwards facing a future full of change and uncertainty?  He's been promised immortality if he withdraws.

18:22.  31,596.  2,456 words on the chapter.  Hm.  I could just end the chapter abruptly.

19:07.  32,441.  1,898 words of progress.  That's quota.  And Taltios just completed a trial with a promised reward, so now I have to decide what the reward is.  The guardian wasn't expecting Taltios to succeed.

19:43.  I also wasn't expecting Taltios to succeed.  I gave him two chances at a 1 in 6 roll.  The obvious reward is a cop-out, as the local god can tell him, "Your reward is knowing you can resist mind control!"  That reward is completely lame and does nothing for Taltios.  The other thing that occurred to me is the ever-classic "a lump of gold" solution.  Just give Taltios something that amounts to money.  Since Taltios is going to Skrend, a pile of paper and a bottle case of ink could be helpful, since Skrend has to use local sourcing to get these things, and their raw material extraction efforts take up time they could spend copying texts and writing new ones.

20:27.  32,930.  3,788 words on the chapter.  2,387 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  Now what?  I don't have anything planned for the next chapter!

20:49.  32,971.  I think I'm done for the day.  2,428 words of progress.
