To make sure I get my word counts correct, I'm updating my notes with today's wordcount.  I'm starting the day with 7168 words in my story, of which I counted 2,568 words written yesterday.  Except the software that I'm writing with counted 2,579 words written.  Little errors upset me...  I don't know where that crept in.  Anyways.  I'll use that total.  My first day's nanowrimo output was 2,579 words.

...tch.  I couldn't resist editing a prior scene just a little bit.  That's going to mess with my ability to record my wordcount accurately today.  There's going to be another anomaly tomorrow.  Oh well, no big deal.  I get a few 'free' words today and I'll get a few 'free' words tomorrow.  The quota is really a pain.

I ended up writing about 1860 words today, for a present total of 4,427 since I started Nanowrimo.  The file I am writing on is 1,848 words long.  I'm recording that because I'm tempted to add a little more to it, and I will need to calculate how much I've added to update the Nanowrimo website if I do.

...there.  2,462 words long.  It's nearly midnight, so I'm going to attribute this productivity to tomorrow and be a little farther along to hitting my writing quota tomorrow.
