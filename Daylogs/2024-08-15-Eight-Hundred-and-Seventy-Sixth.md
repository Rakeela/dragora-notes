9:11.  I played another round of Terraformers this morning.  69 turns to win the Green Path at the lowest difficulty level.  I'm a little slower to get lifeforms on the board than I am to get my economy going.

9:57.  3.1 miles.  544 kcal.  11,276 steps.  2 hours, 21 minutes, and 27 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.

11:53.  Oh hey, I forgot to mark my starting point in writing.  24,954.  25,283.

21:49.  26,990.  2,036 words of progress.  I played with my TTRPG group for four hours, but I also put in a lot of time writing.  Why didn't I get farther?

21:58.  27,006.  2,052 words of progress.  Pausing.
