14:53.  I forgot to clock in this morning!  120,505.

15:10.  120,885.  Whaaaaat.  Was that all I'd done?

15:16.  120,917.  I've got a headache.  I'm going to stop for a bit.

16:03.  Almost back to work.

17:31.  Okay, I got back to work a few minutes ago.  My 'almost' earlier was inaccurate...  I guess I tried and failed to refocus.

17:32.  121,013.  I'm nearing the end of the story.

17:58.  121,208.  There's a band of story that frustrates me because I don't know what I'm going to do with it.  I've been doing other stuff, but I'm just delaying the inevitable point where I have to address the part that's difficult.

19:06.  121,501.  Part of what's damaging my work ethic today is that something coming up in the code is stymying me.

20:06.  Okay, I took another hour off, but I didn't break through what was stopping me.

21:30.  121,665.  Ugh.  Progress is by the inch.
