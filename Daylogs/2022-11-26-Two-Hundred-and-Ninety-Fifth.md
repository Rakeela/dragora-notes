Argh, it's so hard to get to work on writing today.  I want a day off soooo badly.  I won nanowrimo!  Isn't that enough?  No, I want to hit par EVERY DAY.  So I have to keep writing and updating the goal every day of the month...

2,022 words on the file.

2,661 words on the file.  639 words of progress, 1,028 words to go.  It's not flowing today.

Adding to a previous file.  8,935 words on the file.  Adding 3 words.  642 words of progress, 1,025 words to go.

3,302 words on the file.  1,280 words of progress, +3, 384 words to go.  I should make par again tonight.

3,486 words on the file.  1,467 words of progress, 203 words to go.  I think I'm going to do the minimum necessary to reach my goal and then stop.
