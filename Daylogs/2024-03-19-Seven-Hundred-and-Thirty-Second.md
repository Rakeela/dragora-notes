8:24.  52,321.  52,346.  I started work before remembering to include a time point, but I remembered soon enough.

12:58.  55,211.  2,890 words of progress.

13:48.  55,955.  3,634 words of progress.

13:56.  55,955.  I'm sorta staring dumbly at the work.  I have a vague sense of what's supposed to happen next, but it won't crystalize.

13:59.  Eh, whatever, I'm going to catch up on Nationstates.

15:36.  Well, I'm caught up on Nationstates.  As much as I intend to catch up today, at least.

18:36.  I wrote essays on 4chan for three hours!  It was calming.

19:03.  56,171.  I broke through my blockade... a little bit.  It's not easy.

19:23.  56,327.  4,006 words.

19:52.  56,584.  4,263 words.  I'm starting to feel like I don't want to write any more.

20:13.  56,587.  4,266 words.  I'm struggling with this.

20:15.  56,629.  4,308 words.  That was like paperwork.  I just set down placeholders for some future scenes.  They're not even good placeholders.  I need *better* placeholders.

20:20.  56,593.  4,272 words.  I trimmed off one of my placeholders.

20:28.  56,612.  4,291 words.  I think I can't advance any farther tonight.
