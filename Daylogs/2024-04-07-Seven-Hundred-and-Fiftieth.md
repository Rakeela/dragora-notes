17:31.  My work ethic has been appalling lately.  I've been struggling with a local obsession with a porn game that is frankly traumatic.  It left me extremely stressed at first.

18:53.  1,380. 4,895.  Current word count on the twine game.  I'm going to turn this one in and resist the temptation to keep working on it today.  3,515 words.

19:18.  96,144.

19:45.  1,986.  2,204.  218 words.  Credit to 'Spaceraptor', so it's 3,733 words of progress on that account today.

21:30.  I've mostly been working on Knight of Talonia, but I just had an idea for Spaceraptor.

21:31.  2,215.  11 words since I credited it, bringing Spaceraptor's productivity today to 3,744 words.

22:30.  97,474.  1,330 words of progress.  I think I'm done for the night.

22:41.  97,463.  I'm not updating my word count downwards.

22:42.  97,462.  I'm struggling to get my head out of the work.

22:43.  97,470.  8 words of progress.  1,338.

23:00.  2,265.  61 words.  Credit to 'Spaceraptor', so it's 3,794 words of progress.

23:03.  My focus is actually pretty intense.  Whatever I'm focusing on absorbs my whole attention.  It's difficult for me to switch tasks.  The porn game, then Spaceraptor, then Knight of Talonia.  I was actually reasonably productive today, but pulling myself between stressful tasks was hard.
