#2021-8-31-One-Hundred-and-Seventy-Second

Note to self:  Do a writeup on "The Scourging of the Flame" in ten days when Kavikeil kicks the bucket, for canonically publishing it post-humously.  It details an atrocity committed to prevent an atrocity remembered.  Relatedly: Do a write-up on "Ziazien the Atheist" in three days.

Just taking a note for myself of something I'm worried that I'll forget.  One of my pettier projects has an externally-imposed schedule.

I've tried a lot of stuff, mentally.  I've thought through a lot of oddities.  The opportunity to do so is one of the treasures of being a writer.  I'm not a good performative writer; I'm 'a writer with no output'.  Yet I still think through a ton of stories to myself.

Some of this goes to traumatic roots.  Right now I'm thinking about how I tried the kind of easy sexuality that people thought I wanted when I complained that sex was hard.  I imagined having access to kobolds - or drakalen as I prefer to think about them - complete with dragon awe complex.  I stepped back the size distinction and the disdain of dragons until the pairings matched, while leaving the awe complex intact for the thought experiment.  This was a way that I tried having trivial access to sex, with more narrative than simply clicking through some porn game.  (I never learned much by *that*.)  I knew it wasn't what I had meant by wishing sex was easier, but because it was what everyone else had thought I meant, I worked through it as a thought experimernt...  It became one of the several ways that I learned how boring sex could be.

I should possibly add Vennaveld to my character gallery.  Sie was the character who I used for that thought experiment.  Although hir boredom with sex is now canonical, sie didn't especially disgrace hirself, and remains a basically gentle person with a meditative inclination.
