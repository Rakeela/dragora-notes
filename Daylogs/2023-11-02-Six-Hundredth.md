#2023-11-02-Six-Hundredth

11:07.  I'm going to celebrate my six hundredth post by NOT eating a bunch of sweets today!  Probably.  The fact that I'm already thinking about it is a bad sign.

11:08.  7,239 words on the file.  4,043 words on nanowrimo.  

12:19.  I want food!

12:36.  7,543 words on the file.  Hard to make progress.  I'm distracted.

16:09.  I ate a small amount of keto ice cream.

19:48.  Ugh.  I stopped working for a while.  I got very distracted playing a TTRPG... arguing about the rules...  I haven't eaten too much today...  Everything feels complicated right now.  I was feeling brain-burned for a bit, then that faded, but I still have a headache.  I'm tired.  I need to update my wordcount and find out how far from quota I am.

19:49.  7,806.  That's 567 words today.

21:51.  8,919.  1,680 words of progress.  That's 'par' and thus 'quota', but I wonder if I should press onwawrds.

22:24.  9,005.  I checked in the 8,919.  This is another 86 words of progress.
