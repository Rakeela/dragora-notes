I dreamed last night of being a business leader on an island with a strange underground.  Who I was on the surface society hardly mattered; the bulk of the dream (or at least such as I remember) took place underground.  I was one of the four people on the island who could safely explore the underground.

The underground of the island was.... this infinite bureaucracy of drones.  It wasn't like caves at all.  It was like an infinite office park just underground.  There was no end to it and no clear purpose for anything that happened in it; nothing that happened down there had any clear connection to surface society.  Despite this bizarrity, it was a superficially unthreatening place.  The problem was that anyone who stayed there too long lost their individuality and was spontaneously assigned a job in the infinite bureaucracy.  So the island had an issue with people getting lost in its caves and... becoming drone-workers.

Anyone who the island lost underground would get a dream-job, or as near a dream-job as the underground society could adapt to provide.  It could change quite a lot from day to day adapting to the people who were lost in it.  Yet if we could find the lost and get them to... notice us (not always easy)... they would all come back to the surface with us.  Even if we told them frankly that they were going to go from VP of an underground corporation to being a checkout clerk on the surface, they would come back to us.  Nothing mattered in the underground, because they didn't have their own wills, and neither did anyone around them.

When I woke up... a certain nuisance noisemaker was initially quiet, and then it sniffled.  I felt like I'd been shown its own failed paradise: everyone gets their dream job, but at the cost of their free will.  It was a failed paradise because the only way anyone could be kept there was coercively.
