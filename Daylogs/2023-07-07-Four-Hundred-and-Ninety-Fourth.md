08:56.  Yesterday was awful.  I barely got any editing done, and nothing else at all.

09:20.  I'm done with morning stuff...  No wait, not quite.

09:29.  51,433.

11:47.  53,328.  1,895 words of progress.  3,390 words on the chapter.

21:04.  53,333.  I didn't really work on this more, so I'm not sure where the additional five words came from, but okay.  1,900 words of progress.  I worked on Kura and Kaire more today, credit 1,226 words of writing.

22:58.  I walked about eight hours today, going I think about thirteen miles.  The display cut out while I was plugging in my CPAP machine, so I didn't get to record the exact output.
