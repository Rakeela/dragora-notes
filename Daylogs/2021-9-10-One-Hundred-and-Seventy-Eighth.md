I don't really respect people who make decisions in secret, nor who overreact to inputs, creating embarrassments that they must later conceal in secret.

I once feared that I'd learned of the death of someone I knew, and when I spoke to them they proceeded to *magnanimously* inform an entire community of concerns that I'd intended for them alone.  This was of course dreary as they were therefore informing the community of an unknown death.  There was no cause to do that.  They later removed me from that community without speaking to me, an obvious consequence of the basic embarrassment that they inflicted on me and blamed me for.

They were retaliating against me as though my personal concern were an infiltration attempt against the entire community... when it's like... dude, I never cared for anyone else in that community, just you, the one guy I'd actually spoken to.  It was your own demoralization action against the community that you treated me as having originated.  God, congrats on protecting your position.

That watcher-of-loyalties act is an example of why loyalist gatekeepers are symptomatic of corruption.  The guy made people unhappy as 'my fault' and later removed me from that environment in a specifically dishonest way, without ever approaching me with any concerns, because he had doubts about my loyalty due to an *embarrassment that he inflicted on me without cause*.  His decision was treated as my decision.

I have a sworn oath against loyalty, as I believe that loyalty *is* corruption.  People aren't *loyal* to their friends.  They're kind and honest to them, which makes people want to stick together when they find it.  Loyalty is a subpar replacement for honesty for people who can't find honesty.  It's most valued among criminals, as they need to know who will degrade themselves violating others.  Corrupt people who betray corruption are totally useless.

I've been favoring my right leg today.  I've been exercising to try to get to the point of being able to bike to college daily.  I don't think I can climb that hill, literally or metaphorically, because there's a literal awful hill between me and the college.  Right now I've got what appears to be a minor injury to one of the muscles in my left leg.  It only hurts when the muscle tenses, but it's one of the muscles that does tense to support my weight when I'm standing on it.

Fortunately, my balance is good enough that I can stand on my right leg all day.  I've trained for that, too!

I have a mixed history with exercise.  I can do a lot of it, in theory.  I've always had good endurance, yet I exhaust quickly at high intensity.  Very quickly.  High intensity exercise exhausts me so quickly that people don't believe it and think I'm faking in laziness.  I can also do mild-to-moderate exercises from dawn til' dusk.  People don't believe that, either.  As long as I don't go over my exertion cap, it seems like I can exhaust most people, whereas above the cap of how much effort I can put out, nearly anyone can exhaust me.  I've no idea what the biological underpinnings of such an exertion cap are.

I have a mixed history with exercise for another reason, too.  It maximizes my species dysphoria.  I hate the human body.  There's no pleasure in pushing my limits.  I don't want to focus on moving it.  Ever, preferably.  This psychology may be part of my exertion cap.  It may be that I exhaust when I'm working hard enough that exercise starts requiring focus, because focusing on exercise is repulsive to me.  Whereas at lower intensities, I can move in a regular manner without thinking about it, and so continue for very long periods of time.  This is all just speculation though.  It could be a biological issue that I'm inappropriately considering as psychology.

I'm considering changing my morphological desire towards something non-draconic: becoming a bird.  I think people would intuitively understand my relationship with touch if I were a bird.  I like gentle, rare touches.  Most people who are affectionate are *too* affectionate.  If I had a beak and feathers, I think most humans would be drawn to touch me the way I want to be touched, and would otherwise keep the distance I want them to keep.  Also, I could give people feathery hugs.

There are still species dysphoria issues with it.  Maybe I should try for the morphology that I gave to the peacock gryphonesses in [[Polis-Diamonil]].  They're a bit 'dracogryphon' in that they have long, strong tails.  If I aim for some kind of personally-defined species rather than... matching the kind of dragon that I was in my prior lifetime... I think I can produce something that resolves the bodily differences that inflict the most species dysphoria *and* covers me in feathers.  I can aim for 'dragon-bird'... though I wonder if the beak and earfin combination looks good.  Maybe I should commission an artist to produce such a look.
