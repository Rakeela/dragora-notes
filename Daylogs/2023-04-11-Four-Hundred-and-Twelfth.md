While doing today's walking, I decided to dig into a Stellaris campaign with a new focus: codebreaking!  I picked all the espionage advantages I could.  I then proceeded to discover something I already strongly suspected: espionage is presently worthless in Stellaris.  Being able to quickly complete operations reduces costs and lowers risk, but the only worthwhile operation is "steal technology".  You can only perform it every six years and it requires a huge amount of infiltration first.  The problem is, if you don't have a technological advantage, you probably can't perform the operation, and if you do have a technological advantage, you're only likely to steal technologies that you didn't care much about.

The worst part of espionage is that every espionage action consumes influence, a precious and scarce resource needed for expansion.  There's no way to build an economy that regularly supports espionage actions if you also have expansion objectives.  Which I did, because I was playing a Void Dweller civilization.  Even once I ran out of systems to expand to because I'd run into other civilizations, I still needed my influence for building Habitats.

Playing espionage-based on Stellaris is basically an RP challenge.  Those espionage civics are taken in slots that would otherwise go to civics that boost the economy.  I didn't get enough boost power to my economy by the time I ran into my first genocidal opponent.  My fleets were at an overwhelming disadvantage.

I haven't mastered developing fast enough to overcome genocidal empires in Stellaris.

Ugh.  I'm seven hours and thirteen minutes into my walking today and my feet really hurt.  It's gotten hard to continue.

So, I stopped for a while.  It's getting kinda late, but I did eventually recover, so I feel like I can go a bit farther on the treadmill tonight.  Oops, wait!  I have to remedy the hole in my sock to avoid foot injury.

In theory, if I walk towards midnight, I have time to finish my nine hour goal.  I don't think I'm actually going to do that.  We'll see how much farther I actually walk.

Okay, I'm getting an unusual pain stretching from my right inner thigh across to my belly.  I don't know what that is.  It's not terribly severe, but it's weird, so I'm going to stop for the night.
