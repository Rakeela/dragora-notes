Morning weigh-in:  243.8 pounds

As is obvious from my morning weigh-in value, I didn't gorge last night.  I did finish the night by eating some jarlsberg spicy cheese dip with a spoon, but it was almost entirely fat and protein.  The dip was made almost entirely of cheese and mayo.

I had a night of obnoxious dreams from which I ultimately woke up angry.  Dreams sometimes puppeteer me.  The last dream of the morning ended by violating my will.

I've eaten two cookies this morning.  I'm already doing worse than yesterday.

I walked for twenty minutes at low speed on my treadmill, but the treadmill's belt was grinding on the right side.  I'd asked Kistaro to realign it... an attempt was made, but it was worse than it started.  So I've realigned it myself, after asking Kistaro where zie put the tensioning wrench.  The belt is still slipping to the right.
