9:28.  I didn't get up when I wanted to, and somehow it's already been 28 minutes.  All I can think of that I did is that I ate a cookie, talked briefly with a good friend, and read a bit of backlog on a Discord discussion.

9:34.  Oh, I was going to say!  I feel directly like writing!  But somehow Discord just ate up another 6 minutes.  Ugh.  Time is passing unbelievably quickly this morning.

9:35.  84,226.  1,072 words on the chapter.

9:41.  84,237.  Credit... 8 words of writing.  No, it's not the same as the gap.  A few of those words were just edits that don't seem like new writing.

10:24.  84,764.  Credit 527 words of writing.

12:00.  I took a break and dealt with stuff I usually deal with first thing in the morning.  It took a little more than an hour and a half, as we can see, to go through Nationstates and Flight Rising.

12:17.  84,886.  Credit 122 words of writing.  657 words of progress.  Not a lot of writing, but important content.  1,721 words on the chapter.

13:39.  Oh, and the file is at 84,980 words.  By crediting everything I add, my 'words written' goes up even though the file is shedding word count.

15:51.  I felt stymied, so I took my book for a walk, and I read as I visited the stores to acquire medicines and check on the sweets.  I've found that no matter how many sweets I collect, I always want more, and my collection is even starting to be limited by the 'best by' dates.  I wanted to acquire enough to attain an invincibility, and never be tempted because I *had* enough, but that has not happened.  Instead, I have found that the character of my temptation has changed, but the fact of my temptation has not.

16:25.  84,358.

17:52.  85,488.  1,130 words on the chapter.  Credit 1,130 words.  2,435 words of progress.  I want to say "chapter complete," but there's no way I can end a chapter on 1,130 words.  Can I?
