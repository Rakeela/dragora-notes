9:55.  52,039.

10:02.  52,068.  This is kind of a hard bit to write.

13:45.  I stopped and played videogames for a while.

14:07.  I've been working on a new base in No Man's Sky.  It's in an outlaw system.  I can't use the local station teleporter, but I can use a base teleporter.  That can get me in and out of the system.

14:08.  I feel helpless to write my next scenes correctly.  I'm trying to develop a relationship between three characters.  One of them is supposed to be irritating, but ultimately cool.  I don't know how to create a bad first impression effectively.  Well, bad second impression.  They met once already and sort of traded prophecies.

15:23.  52,695.  926 words of progress.

15:27.  Sexual content is boring and stressful.  I have two characters who are supposed to be big on sex, and I just... can't write it.  I can't even get close to it.  The Theoma that I imagine is fairly easy about sex, because there are no STDs or unplanned pregnancies, and very few (not quite no) abusive people.

15:31.  Humans are so bad at sex.  Not biologically.  The human body is diversely capable in sexuality, with many options for sexual interaction.  Emotionally.  Humans are emotionally bad at sex.  I can't write about a world where people are better at sex, because humans will project their own failings into it.

16:56.  54,265.  1,570 words since I last updated progress.  2,496 for today.
