20:40.  Last night, the voices in my head tried to convince me that god was angry with me.  I gave them an earful (quietly, by thinking at them) about how their god was an evil tyrant and false.  They have a specific god, who is basically a headmate that I'm forced to deal with sometimes, and who I absolutely do not deify.  I am however still worried that someone, somewhere is using technological means to try to intrude upon my thoughts, and they would like me to worship this bogus godform to modify my behavior.  I worry that someone has done something to me which "strong minds resist".  I'm diagnosed schizophrenic.  The idea that I'm just schizophrenic is reassuring, but it feels weak.

21:55.  Talking about the voices earlier was 'beaconing', their term for talking about them.  They hate beaconing and claim that it spreads schizophrenia into the world.  I say bring it on.  Being transparent is essential to integrity.
