My poorly sorted notes on The Viceroy are starting to annoy me.  I'm reaching for the end of the first draft pass on the bulk of the text (ideological analysis of the tech tree), and the poorly sorted nature of the notes I've got is starting to seem obtrusive.

I'm also aware that I don't have enough understanding of the implied ideological flow of the technologies.  For instance, Telepathic Dust could mean something different in every different cultural evolution.  If the Imperials are the concluding population, then the Imperial Hive Mind could have used telepathic dust as a kind of precursor technology while reaching for their amazing mental unity.  If the Panarchists are the concluding population, then the telepathic dusts were a diversifying force which helped people explore all the range of sensation.  If the Commonwealth are the concluding population, then the telepathic dusts helped them organize their labors so that they could be happy while supporting each other.

I don't know where to *put* this in my notes, this thing about how each different 'flow' suggests that the technology had different societal consequences.  The unifying factor is that the telepathic dusts always enable artistic creations to achieve new heights of self-expression (by disseminating the author's emotions), shared performance (by disseminating emotions across performers), and emotional impact (by affecting the audience more directly).  That could have *varied* consequences.  Who can predict the true flow of history?
