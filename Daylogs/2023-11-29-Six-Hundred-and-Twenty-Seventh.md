11:32.  I'm adding 233 words to yesterday's wordcount and 579 to the day before.  That accounts for project-related work I did on my World Anvil wiki.

15:31.  23,820.  Oh whoops, I forgot to give myself my starting wordcount a few hours ago when I started work.  That was 22,020.  I've written 1,800 words so far.  450 words an hour.

16:51.  I took off for a bit, buying veggie foods that I'll eat later.  Not today!  I'm fasting!  Sorta.  As much as I usually do, which is to say that I eat a bit in the morning and then don't eat in the afternoon and evening.  After I got back from being out, I participated in a chat for a while.  It was fun.

16:52.  I've been consuming a lot of potassium lately, and I've been having a lot of hypokalemic attacks lately.  I don't know why I've been suffering so much hypokalemia.  My best days lately have been days on which I started the day with prophylactic potassium even though I didn't feel like I needed it yet.  Some of the days on which I started with prophylactic potassium didn't turn out well, but all the days on which I didn't start with prophylactic potassium have been bad.

16:58.  Wow, the last few minutes just slipped by without anything happening.  WTF.  I was just kinda thinking, "I don't want to work," and it was like several minutes passed while I was placidly walking to the bookshelf and back.

17:56.  24,400.  2,380 words of progress.  That's like 380 words an hour.  Come on.

17:59.  I recalculated.  It's about 369 words an hour.  My estimate wasn't bad.  Still, I only 'write quickly' because I sink hour after hour into writing.  Grrrrrrrr.

18:02.  I am devouring half a dozen mint Oreos... and throwing out the rest of my Mint Oreos.  By the way, having now tried both gluten free and glutinous mint Oreos, the gluten free ones are good, but the texture is off.  The glutinous ones are better.  Although frankly, Oreos are such a perfect example of hyperpalatable foods that they're a nightmare which shouldn't be touched.

18:04.  God.  The urge to devour more Oreos is so strong that I'm literally tempted to dig the Oreos out of the trash to wolf down more of them.  What an appalling food.  The hyperpalatability is completely revoltingly intense.  They don't taste *that* good, but they trigger this fiending fervor that makes me want to eat more and more of them.

18:12.  I'm going to officially pause my writing again.

20:01.  I'm back.  Back to writing, I'm not sure.

23:18.  I'm back.  I'm going to try to write a little bit more.  Just a tidbit.

23:22.  Disbelief.  I bought peppermint cookies, and they're no good at all.  My tastes have drifted so far away from sweets that most of them are now unappealing to me!  It's...  it's different, and it's weird.  Everything tastes different lately.

23:41.  24,454.  Only a small change, but it matters.  2,434 words.  I'm turning it in.
