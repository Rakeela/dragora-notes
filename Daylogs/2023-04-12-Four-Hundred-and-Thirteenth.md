Books are hard to read sometimes.  Everything works out eventually (in most books), but it can be hard to believe in the good outcome sometimes.  Sometimes I dislike books where the happy ending is too hard to believe in.  But then, at least its better than in real life, where there aren't any happy endings.  Everything in life is followed by another thing.  Not all the things are bad, but eventually the bad outweighs the good.

I devoured a book in one day today.  I started reading it when it arrived in the mail, and then I continued reading it until I'd finished it.  That was the second novel in the [[Fluff-A-Wholesome-LitRPG]] series.  It was an escape.  I just latched onto it.  Reading it was so much easier than working on any of my projects.  I don't want to work.  I want to eat, sleep, play games, and read books.  I like games less than I used to, but after devouring that book my mind turned to Stellaris again.  I clutched my head in stress wanting and not wanting to play Stellaris.  Wanting and not wanting to work on my projects.

The dream I had last night insulted my intelligence because I don't work on my projects enough.  I don't think that's quite it.  I think my sloth is clearly a form of insanity.

I might think the same of gluttony, but that's easier to work around.  My weight is stable and clearly my endurance is decent.  I'm still struggling to achieve a weight loss mindset.  If I understand metabolism correctly, I can devour all the cocoa butter that I want without gaining weight, and gaining weight by eating cheese would be a gastronomically improbable feat.  I have scraped together a few cheese products that I find satisfying.  I can eat those.  The cocoa butter is a temptation to religion; it's so much better than cheese and it produces even less of an insulin response.  Cocoa butter feels like a divine gift reassuring me that food isn't meant to be an esoteric torment.  I also bought some sugar free candy recently.  That stuff is more obesogenic than cheese, but I can still eat it in fairly large servings.  Nuts also don't seem to drive weight gain; I eat quite a bit of them even on successful weeks where my weight drops.

I've found these things, and they reassure me that I will find a way to lose weight.  Mindset, though.  I have to stop longing for the foods I shouldn't have.  Two things are killing my weight loss ambitions.  First off, I weaken daily with an exception to my diet.  This isn't making me fat, but it's sure not making me skinny.  Second, the weekends.  I eat a ton on the weekends.  Kistaro encourages me to eat on the weekend.  Kistaro thinks zie encourages moderation, but *zie encourages me to eat*.  ANY encouragement to eat is immoderate.  Moderate eating is a popular inaccuracy.

I finally know what it's like to eat a sustainable amount of food!  This is a triumph I never thought I'd see!  I eat a lot of stuff that I really want to eat, I even eat very impulsively, and yet my weight isn't going up!  I loaded my diet with fats and nuts, and now I can eat what I want and not get fatter!  This would be awesome if I weren't 65 pounds over my target weight.  I need to do better than treading water.  I need to find a way to harden my will a little further.  That's what I mean by finding a weight loss mindset.

But I'm hiding from my projects again.  I'm stressed out and running from the stuff I actually need to do.  Reading books that are like nothing I would ever write isn't making me a better writer, is it?  Trying questionable strategies in Stellaris isn't making me a better writer, is it?

I played a bit of Stellaris.  Then I rewatched an episode of Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet.  There appear to be two new episodes after the former season finale.  Did I watch those before?  I'll watch them soon.  I don't understand how people get bored.  Earth produces so many novelties.  I'm drowning in novelty.  I can't ever catch up.  It's impossible to get ahead of the flood of novelty.  How can there be people who look at this world and think, "Nothing ever happens"?  I'm drowning.

I'm drowning, and my projects... are nothing but novelties.  Several books.  A game.  Things that people will engage with briefly and then move on from.  Earth doesn't need my work to have a never-ending flood of novelty.
