#2023-04-20-Four-Hundred-and-Twentieth

It's my birthday.  I woke up too early, I'm cold deep down, and I forgot my birthday was coming up when I embarked on a long fast.  A bit of walking on my treadmill should fix the coldness, but there's no fixing the fact that my fasting timer is assuming I'll keep avoiding food for another two hundred hours.  172 hours, actually.  That's 7 days left.  I think I'll stop fasting and eat today, but I haven't decided on that yet.

Maybe I should just read today.  Like, not avoiding anything, but deciding early on that today is a gift day of reading where I don't have to feel bad about it.  I've just started a book written by an acquaintance.  It's kinda short and I bet I can read it today.

Twenty minutes on the treadmill cured the sense of being cold.  Two hours with the book... finished it completely.  A short book.  Petrichor.
