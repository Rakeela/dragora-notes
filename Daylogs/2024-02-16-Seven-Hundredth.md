11:06.  I got up a few minutes after 5:00, before 5:07 for certain, and I didn't accomplish anything noteworthy.  My energy eventually ran out and I crashed on the couch for two and a half hours.

11:35.  48,648.

13:08.  48,661.  Most of the little work was done right after the previous timepoint.

13:10.  I feel like I've been productive, but I can't say what I've been doing.  I'm not sure.  I just have that 'I've been working on a creative project' feeling.

13:12.  I did get the completion on a commission that I made.

17:05.  49,605.  I got sideswiped by a bonus session with my TTRPG group.

17:06.  Now I'm reflecting that I'm at ease when I'm just eating.  Periodically snacking.  Not binging.  I've decided to let the fast timer run as though I were fasting, and I'm just cheating brazenly on it.  It's frustrating.  I'm frustrated with myself.  I'm still being controlled by hunger, rather than controlling it.

19:20.  How time flies.  I'm still at 49,605.  Not good progress.

(This part added the next day.)  12.3 miles.  2015 kcal.  42,414 steps.  8 hours, 22 minutes, and 59 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.  This tally was inflated by a minute or two because I witlessly started it the next day.
