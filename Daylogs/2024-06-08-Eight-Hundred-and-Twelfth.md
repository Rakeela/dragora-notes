11:18.  105,648.

11:19.  105,691.  I didn't write that in one minute, but I had it written already, and I was updating my log.  I've been working since I woke up again, barring an hour earlier where I was awake and didn't get anything done.

11:25.  I'd say I've been working since 10:36 for the purpose of tabulating hours today.

11:48.  Stopping work now.  Time to go pick up lunch.

12:37.  Back from lunch.

15:23.  I decided to watch Kistaro play a game rather than do more work.  It's Kistaro's hatchday today.

15:24.  105,718.  I didn't do that in a minute, I did it earlier before I stopped work, and didn't record the small amount of additional word count.

16:29.  Okay, I've got a TTRPG session, but I kinda want to load up Wasteland Engineering and try to multitask.  The roleplaying is making me anxious and I want a distraction that isn't too much of a distraction.

18:22.  106,186.  I've been working.  It's just slow-going.  I have to introduce new characters who won't get a lot of screen-time, and I have to make sure they serve their purposes.

18:42.  106,559.  Twenty minutes to write a single card in Wasteland Engineering.  There are 360 cards so far, eight of which are placeholders.

18:51.  I accidentally turned off the treadmill, so.  3.0 miles.  510 kcal.  10,668 steps.  2 hours, 7 minutes, and 30 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.

(This part added the next day.)  1003 words produced yesterday.  I missed a little bit of what I wrote.
