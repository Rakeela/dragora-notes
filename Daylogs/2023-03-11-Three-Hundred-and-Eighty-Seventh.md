2 o'clock.  I just took naproxen and acetaminophen for a heel pain that developed while exercising.  It's a pain that starts at my left heel and then traces forward.  It's periodic.  It crawls under my foot from my heel.

(Added the next day:) I walked 14 miles, most of it at 3.0 mph, training my ability to walk at 3mph for extended periods of time.  I walked 5 hours, 1 minutes, and 10 seconds.  I took 34,523 steps.  I burned an estimated 1,787 kcal.  My average speed was 2.8 mph, courtesy of an early warm-up at lower speed.
