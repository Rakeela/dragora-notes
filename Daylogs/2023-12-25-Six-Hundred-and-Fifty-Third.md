14:35.  Merry Christmas!  I've been wasting time and enjoying the day, but I'm starting to feel enjoyed out and ready to write, even though I didn't set myself up to write.  71,579.

20:14.  73,472.  I binged a bunch of Owl House with Akity.  What a great show!  1,893 words of progress.

22:55.  74,800.  3,221 words of progress.  85% of Meratep's Travelogue is done.  Huh, I didn't plan for the story to wrap up in 15k words from where I am.  I kinda got into it and now I'm threatening to go overlength.
