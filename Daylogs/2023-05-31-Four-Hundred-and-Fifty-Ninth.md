9:34.  I had trouble getting up today, despite nightmares.

11:31.  I wish I could get to work more quickly, more often.  Maybe I need to get up earlier.  30,820.  1,915 words on the chapter.

12:17. 31,373.  2,468 on the chapter.  

12:37.  31,562.  2,657 on the chapter.  Chapter complete.

13:18.  32,076.  447 on the chapter.  I had an idea for a scene that I was excited to write.  It took 447 words.  Now I don't know what to write next.

14:46.  33,187.  1,561 on the chapter.  

15:06.  33,470.  1,844 on the chapter.

17:02.  I went out running errands.  I bought myself shorts in the next size down as well as a bunch of sweets for my stash, I bought Kistaro a few raspberry chocolate bars, and I bought some seaweed salad, ranch dressing, and a falafel wrap.  I'll eat the seaweed salad tomorrow morning, along with the *other* falafel wrap that I have in the fridge.  The ranch dressing was a grocery request by Kistaro.

19:02.  33,847.  2,191 on the chapter.

19:46.  34,189.  2,533 on the chapter.

19:59.  34,425.  2,779 on the chapter.

20:06.  34,466.  2,824 on the chapter.

20:28.  34,744.  3,102 on the chapter.  Oops.  I really love writing Kaire.

20:35.  34,720.  3,078 on the chapter.  I have to trim this more...

20:40.  34,698.  3,056 on the chapter.  Trimming is hard.

20:45.  34,635.  2,993 on the chapter.  I found something good to trim out.  I kinda like it, but efficiency makes demands.

20:50.  34,637.  2,995 on the chapter.  Two important words.  Now...  3,817 words of progress.

20:52.  I'm wearing the shorts I bought today.  They fit well.  I've dropped two sizes in my recent dieting.

21:21.  I feel extremely done with today.  I'm not sleepy yet, but I'm satisfied that I've done everything I need to do, and I just want to end the day now.  Should I lay down?

21:30.  6 miles. 1,036 kcal.   20,867 steps.  4 hours, 28 minutes, 29 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  I'm obviously doing no more walking tonight, so I may as well record it instead of having yet another bit added the next day.
