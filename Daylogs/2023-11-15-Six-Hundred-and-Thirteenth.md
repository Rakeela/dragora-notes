11:01.  42,003.  I felt stuck in my plotline yesterday and I feel stuck in it again today.

15:07.  43,424.  I'm still not eating sweets.

15:39.  43,509.  1,506 words of progress.  I need more.

18:18.  45,237.  3,234 words of progress.  That may be enough for today.  Probably.  I might come back.  I just need to do something else now.

18:41.  I got backups set up on my new computer, and then I trimmed something from the story that made a character sound like a petulant child.  45,233.  3,230 words of progress.

21:27.  45,212.  I trimmed the story a bit.  I won't count it against my progress.  One of my players made a decision I didn't foresee, so I rearranged the dialogue.

21:28.  45,214.

22:42.  45,212.  Some effort went into this despite the tiny change in wordcount, but then I laid on the couch for a while.  It's time for bed.  Everything was writing today.  Writing writing writing.
