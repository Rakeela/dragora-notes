#2021-6-30-One-Hundred-and-Thirty-Fourth

[[2021-6-29-One-Hundred-and-Thirty-Third|Yesterday]] I experimented with burning off liquor for the first time.  Today, I'm wondering what other alcohols can be burned off to create interesting flavors.  Obviously, I can use this to improve the flavor next time I try to create cherry candies.  I wonder if there are other alcohols that are also useful.

I also wonder if I should create a section in my notes for cooking notes.  It's a good basic skill.
