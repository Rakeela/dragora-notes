8:48.  Maybe I can get started earlier today.  5,575.  I've decided that I'm going to cheat every day of my current three day fast.  I'm going to eat one thing every day.  Yesterday's cheat was a massive chocolate bar.  Today's cheat, I intend to be a box of chow mein from Panda Express.

8:49.  I can't have that for two hours, so I'd better distract myself with writing.  I always wake up hungry, I swear...  It's not too bad this time, I'm often hungrier.

10:38.  6,872.  1,297 words of progress.  Today's quota was 1,242, so I've already met it!  But I plan to come back and do more writing after I get that chow mein for today's meal.

11:03.  Chow mein consumed.

19:08.  11,658.  6,083 words of progress.  Wait, what?  

20:07.  12,565.  I ate a dozen graham crackers, too.  I guess I'm just not really fasting.  Still, this will trim my eating enough to stop me from having constant gas.  Anyways.  6,990 words of progress.  Oof.  I think I want to stop here for now.  I'm going to turn this one in.

20:48.  13,096.  531 words of progress since I turned it in.  7,521 for the day.
