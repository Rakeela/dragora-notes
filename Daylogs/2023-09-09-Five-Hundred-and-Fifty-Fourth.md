03:27.  

3:59.  The 3:27 mark was when I woke up.  I meant to say something, but I got distracted and forgot what it was.

4:01.  I woke up from very pleasant dreams thinking, "I want to get up and work!"  Now however I kinda want to go play my latest LCS file, where I've been seeing if I can win while committing no crimes at all.

6:45.  I played more of the no crimes LCS file.  I think the issues are slowly tilting my way, but background influence is quite slow.

20:20.  I have a day log up, but I guess I'm not doing any writing today.
