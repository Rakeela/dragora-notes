I use a fasting tracker to track my dieting.  I'd use a dieting tracker to do it, but I don't have access to such a piece of software.  I'd feel self-conscious dieting at a target of 500 calories per day, anyways.  Most diets discourage that.

I actually have been "doughnut fasting" lately.  I mentioned the delicious doughnuts of an almost-local store last month ([[2022-02-03-Two-Hundred-and-Twenty-Seventh]]).  If I travel six miles (which is good exercise), I can have a doughtnut.  If I eat one doughnut per day in the absence of other foods, I still lose weight.

The hardest part about "doughnut fasting" is that a few days of making the twelve mile round trip journey results in pain that makes me crave protein.  If I keep doing it, will this eventually be a trivial journey?
