4586 words.  393 words of progress, 1,274 words to go.  Oh my gryphon, I'm getting *bored* of this story.  I'm ramming my head into it and carving out new words anyways, but I feel like it's a fresh kind of bad.

4,724 words.  531 words of progress, 1,136 words to go.  This might be a day with many tallies.

5,974 words.  1,781 words of progress, 114 words over quota.  Whoa.  That went a lot faster after the first five hundred words.

6,279 words.  2,086 words of progress, 419 words over quota.  I've kept tapping away at it.  I keep reaching for a future scene, thinking it'll be just around the corner if I can only wrap up what I'm currently doing.  I haven't reached it yet.

6,382 words.  2,189 words of progress, 522 words over quota.  I think I'll stop here for the moment, but I may work more this evening.
