I polished off a handpie at 3:50 AM, hours before my morning weigh-in.

---
Oops!  I forgot to do a morning weigh-in!  This one is a 2 PM weigh-in.  244.3 pounds.

I weigh myself more often than I record in my journal.  My weight seems to be higher in the middle of the day than it is in the mornings and evenings.  I don't know why.  I always weigh myself wearing highly similar clothing to minimize clothing-based variation.  I think it's because I drink a lot of fluids in the morning and in the middle of the day.

Still, my weight showed a worrying bounce here.  I haven't eaten anything since the handpie save a few pieces of baked cheese and a shot of heavy cream.  If the whole handpie went to glycogen...

Let's see...  I've read that glycogen storage is 15 grams per kilogram of body weight.  I weigh 108 kilograms, so I can store 1,620 grams of glycogen.  Every unit of glycogen bonds to 4.5 grams of water, so that's 7,290 grams of water.  That's 16 pounds of stored water.  Hm.  That doesn't sound right at all.  I've never had a meteoric loss of 16 pounds.  Clearly I must have miscalculated this.  If I take the 1,620 grams estimate as valid, that's about 3.6 pounds.  I've had a meteoric loss of *more* than 3.6 pounds.  That doesn't sound right either, although it's closer.

In this case, I seem to have gained 2 pounds!  The handpies contain 61 grams of carbohydrates each.  Each gram of carbohydrates contains 4 calories.  Each gram of glycogen stores 4 calories.  It's 1 to 1.  61 grams of carbohydrates is only 0.13 pounds.  It I assume that each gram of glycogen stores 4.5 grams of water with it, I get a predicted fluctuation of 0.585 pounds.  Wait, no.  That's 335.6 grams, or 0.73 pounds.

I exercise enough that my glycogen stores should have been depleted, and my daily liquor is intended to help keep them that way by suppressing gluconeogenesis.  That depletion of glycogen stores should have lead to quick storage of the intruding carbohydrates as new glycogen reserves.

Speaking of exercise, I've already walked 2.6 miles on my treadmill, burning an estimated 412 calories of energy.  The carb-calories in that handpie only amounted to 244.  The rest of the handpie's 410 calories were nearly all fat calories with which I'm unconcerned.  Calories-in/calories-out is such trash!  The weight fluctuation is determined by insulin, not energy tally.

Looking up my glycogen water storage ratio again, it looks like each gram of glycogen stores 2.7 grams of water.  So it's a 1:2.7 ratio, not a 1:4.5 ratio.  That means the handpie should have resulted in the gain of 225.7 grams, or 0.5 pounds.  Huh.  Each handpie is half a pound in glycogen+water weight.  That's quite a way to think of it.

The handpie should also have contained 18 grams of fat, if each gram of fat is 9 calories and the carb calories are 244.  Let me go check if that's accurate...  17 grams of fat and 3 grams of protein.  Pretty close.  The remaining 20 grams shouldn't contribute much to the weight impacts of the handpie.  Until protein counts get substantially higher than that, it's all about the carbs.

I've definitely drank a lot of fluids today.  I keep needing to pee.  Exercising may be exacerbating that, if I understand correctly, since exercise will be busting up my fresh new glycogen reserves from last night.

Sigh.  It's hard not to eat more.  I kinda want another handpie, but even more than that, I want more of the beans I ate yesterday.

1,412 words on the file.  1,552 words on the file.  140 words of progress.  Ugh!  I'm being killed by a plot bunny.  I'm dying of my disinterest and disbelief in RPG games.  How are there always problems to solve conveniently when the player characters need problems to solve?

Ugh.  I waited around a while and weighed myself again.  242.1 pounds.  There's the downwards trajectory I expected!  But ugh.  I am so hungry right now.  Of course, I'm well aware that sitting around *not* eating keeps my insulin levels low, so that my body accesses stored energy reserves.

I have just finished reading a massive book that has no page numbers.  Summoned! to an RPG World, by Oisin Muldowney.  If I ever read it again, I'll mark the best descriptive moments with flags attached to the pages, so that I can overcome the lack of page numbers.  The book is so gigantic that I won't likely read it again any time soon.  I left a review of it on Goodreads.  4 stars.  The ending was a letdown.

I weighed myself again.  241.9 pounds.  Fully dressed, in my usual attire.  If I'm not eating, I just exhale weight.  Two tenths of a pound in a few hours since I last weighed myself.

Am I really going to let the clock run tomorrow?  I've already arranged for tomorrow's meal.  It should be two meals worth of food.  Tomorrow emphatically will not be a day of fasting, but if I eat only what Kistaro knows about, I will allow myself to let the clock run on my fasting tracker.  No snacking.  I shouldn't even eat my cheese snacks; on a day when my insulin levels will be elevated, even fat calories should be stored away in my own body fat.  Definitely no handpies.

I chugged a can of diet soda.  243.3 pounds.  No calories.  Obviously, it hasn't affected my true, underlying weight.  The amount of fluid that I'm carrying can easily make a day look like I gained weight.

Hm, weighed myself a little latter.  Now it says 241.9 again.  Haven't urinated or anything.  Can't have actually lost that much weight.  Must be the variance on the scale.

I took another shot of heavy cream.

I walked 4.1 miles today, burning an estimated 631 kcal, taking 12,643 steps, and walking for 2 hours, 20 minutes, and 43 seconds, at an estimated speed of 1.7 mph.
