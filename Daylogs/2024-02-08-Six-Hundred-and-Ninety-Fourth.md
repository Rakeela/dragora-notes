7:52.  I got up at like 6:24.  It takes me too long to get going in the morning.

8:08.  My morale is weak.  I haven't managed to do anything yet.

8:23.  Sometimes when I read highly structured texts, I wonder, "Did an AI write this?"  My exposure to AI writing has biased me towards rougher materials.

8:28.  So.  Freaking.  Demoralized.  Argh!

8:32.  I'm not getting anything done, but I'm writing these to try to record the process this time.  If I stay engaged, I'll get through it more quickly.  Now...  Let's try reading Ashen Weald for a bit.

8:49.  I read for a bit, and was just getting up when I kinda fell back ragdoll into the chair.  I'm really weak right now.  Maybe I'd be less 'demotivated' if I took potassium.

9:15.  I dunno, I just wanted to record another time point.  Not much has changed.

9:16.  I'm very tired.  Starting to feel emotionally okay, but I still feel weak.  Not as bad as earlier.  My legs are holding my weight steadily.  Just weak.

9:17.  Slantworld is at the point where I need to describe Farpoint Adainu.  I don't have any great ideas.

9:22.  I'm going to play EaW for a bit.  Kistaro gave me a new idea for how to advance Greifensmarchen.

11:23.  I played my cheat-heavy Greifensmarchen game for nearly two hours, then I put in laundry.

11:52.  I felt weak again, so I took potassium and sat down to read.  This is the second time I've taken potassium today (the first time was earlier when I mentioned feeling weak).

11:54.  I have a headache.  I already took naproxen earlier.  I'll take acetominophen.

13:41.  I have spent all day feeling weak.  I just broke down and ate something.  I had an avocado spring roll and a bismarck donut.  I will leave the fast timer running until I eat something else.

13:45.  I'm feeling much better now.  Strength is returning to me.

13:47.  I want to get to work writing, but this is an inappropriate moment, as there is an ongoing cleaning.  I will retreat upstairs and get to work when the cleaning is done.  I wish potassium had helped...  I would like a pharmaceutical intervention to improve my strength while I am fasting.  I have noticed that I can focus my will to improve my stance while walking, and that helps, but even that I wasn't doing very well.  Can I make myself stronger?

15:55.  I played a round of The Viceroy for the Commonwealth Unifiers.  I also took some (paper) notes on the game.  I'm capable of taking influence from it.

(This part added the next day.)  I forgot to record my time before starting my next day's time, and this scrams two days worth of records!
