12:34.  My commitment to tasting and discarding candies is weakening.  A package I ordered quite a while ago finally arrived, and I ate a huge chocolate bar in its entirety despite not being that impressed with it.  Oh woe!  It wasn't what I wanted, but I ate it anyways!

22:03.  I have been devouring so much food lately.  I'm going to go back to fasting soon.
