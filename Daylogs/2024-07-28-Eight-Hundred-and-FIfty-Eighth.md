16:50.  I forgot to record my treadmill usage yesterday.  94,039.

21:23.  I am tempted to try to post a video to Youtube where I talk about Stolitz.  Except I have no equipment, no understanding of editing, and no current planning as to what I'd say.  It's a very weak thought that lacks the will to carry it through.

(This part added the next day.)  I forgot to record my treadmill usage again.  94,056.  I wasn't very productive in writing, either.
