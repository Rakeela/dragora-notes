10:12.   65,552.

11:52.  66,716.  1,164 words of progress.

12:40.  66,925.  Struggling to focus.

16:23.  67,627.  I haven't been very focused at all.  2,075 words of progress.  I multitasked with two movies, but I still made a bit of headway.  Now I've run out of planned content again...

20:22.  67,919.  2,367 words of progress.  Today has been slow, and I'm getting mentally exhausted.  I want to be doing something else.  There's nothing I particularly want to be doing, just *something else*.
