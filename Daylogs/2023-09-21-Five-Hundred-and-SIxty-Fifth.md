11:05.  I slept in later than I intended to.  I had dreams of puzzles, which kinda sucked.

16:12.  I was recently gifted (by my mate's parents) a new article of clothing.  It is soft, fluffy, and extremely comfortable.  It is an upgrade on my favorite sweater, which had been my favorite article of clothing for *years*.  I can't believe I got something *better* than that.  Like, I'm still kinda in disbelief.  Maybe this new fluffy thing won't *really* be as good as my old fluffy thing.  Oh yeah, I called the old favorite sweater "the fluffy thing" and now that title has competition.

16:51.  45,169.

18:04.  46,623.  1,454 words of progress.  That's quota.  I'm not sure what to write next.

18:08.  46,659.  1,490 words of progress.  Ugh.  I'm immediately stalled.
