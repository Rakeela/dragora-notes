4:41.  I dreamed of writing.  I dreamed of two different stories.  At least one of them was a twine game about being a kobold.  Both stories had themes of patriotism.  At least one of them was about being a soldier.

4:42.  The first one included a reference to the Viceroy, where there was a cultural shift process involved as society developed, such that society became suffused with the spirit of the Empire, but I wasn't sure if it was a terminal state or a transitional state.

4:43.  At least one of the stories was a twine game about being a kobold.  The other one, I think was not about being a kobold.

4:44.  I'm not sure the other one was even a twine game.

4:45.  In the game about being a kobold soldier (the second one), I remember near the end deciding to add a choice point where the player would be asked which of several pieces of loot they would add to a priority pile which had to be given to the state.

4:46.  I was planning to emphasize two things to the player: it was supposed to be the item that they considered most subjectively valuable, and that failing to provide a piece of loot would be considered to be 'lacking autonomy'.

4:47.  The meaning of autonomy in this context was not yet fully established, but by this one example, it sounds like it was being defined in a way that centered on the capacity of the VC to support the goals of the state.

4:48.  As I lay in bed trying to recover the dreams for writing this, I decided that one of the three pieces of loot the player would have recovered would have been a book (a spellbook?), and the state would have seen the player's decision to provide a book as interesting.  The player would have been offered literacy training at that point.

4:49.  I wonder what makes a society uniquely 'gryphon'.  I always think, when considering writing projects, 'What Would Vale Want to Read?'  This thought is a reminder to include more gryphon characters.

4:50.  Having Vale as my favorite author makes me want to write a lot more gryphon stories than I otherwise would, and makes me want to convert ideas to gryphon ideas.

6:48.  Ow!  I think I just had a seizure.  My arms moved on their own and seized up.  Muscles all the way from my fingers to my chest were spasming.

6:49.  That hurt a bit and it was intensely uncomfortable. 

6:50.  was watching the Tope Talk on Robots and I had to scroll it back to before that fit happened, because I was too distracted.

6:52.  Was that muscle spasming or muscle shaking?  Is there a difference?

7:02.  Wow, I was just about to start working on my Twine project when that seizure hit.  I forgot what I'd been about to do for like fifteen minutes.

7:03.  125,105.

7:33.  I desperately wanted a donut, but I thought as I was going to fetch it, "If I really wanted to maximize my energy levels, I would buy two donuts, and then keep one for two hours before I eat it.  Can I do that?  No, I can't do that.  How many donuts do I want?  Two."

7:34.  So I turned around and had a bowl of Crispix instead.

7:52.  I'm being interfered with by internal screaming.  Not an outside force, just my own stress.

15:13.  127,923.  I've been working steadily!  It's been over eight hours now.

15:22.  There's a wasp in my house.  I'm going to stop working and hide from it.

18:02.  Kistaro said sie didn't find the wasp earlier, but I focused on playing Glyde anyways.  I continue to improve at that game.  It's fun to observe the small, steady progress that I've been making.
