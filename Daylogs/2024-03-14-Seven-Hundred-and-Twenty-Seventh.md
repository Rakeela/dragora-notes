9:25.  I slept terribly.  My breathing hurt.  I think I would've been better off without the CPAP mask.  Also, Kistaro woke me up partway through the night to tell me I was farting in my sleep.

11:29.  I thought earlier that I would take today off, but I'm already looking at my story again and thinking about it.

11:45.  33,954.  I was thinking earlier, "Oh, I'll just make one little change before tallying my starting wordcount.  The count will go down with this change, anyways."  33,907.  Haha, no.  Word count up.

13:10.  34,671.  764 words of progress.

13:56.  35,043.  1,136 words of progress.  My productivity has been slow today, but I've hardly come up for air since my last timepoint.

14:47.  35,472.  1,565 words of progress.

15:29.  35,998.  2,091 words of progress.  Gotta stop here.  Time for my TTRPG group.

15:37.  36,037.  2,130 words of progress.  The TTRPG group hasn't gotten started yet.

20:52.  35,932.  I found my most recent bit of the story uninspired, so I bit it back.

22:07.  36,811.  2,904 words of progress.

22:08.  1,450 words on the Worldbuilding file.

22:25.  1,710 words on the Worldbuilding file.  I'm feeling stressed and I want to sleep, so I'm thinking that I'll stop now.  260 words of worldbuilding.
