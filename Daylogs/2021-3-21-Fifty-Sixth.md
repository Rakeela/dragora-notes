I really don't want to organize anything.  I don't want to create any organizations at all.  It sounds like a lot of work for a world that is compulsively hateful and desperate to tear down anything that would make 'the wrong people' happy, as humans seem to be.  Whatever organization I build, someone is going to want it to fail.

Philosophically, a hatred is any state of affinity where you actively want others to suffer.  Practically, I think the difference between a dislike and a hatred is that dislikes have objectives and hatreds are just robotic programming.  I understand why people dislike violent ghetto culture; I don't understand why humans hate dark skin.  Avoiding violence is an objective; hating dark skin is programming.  People can balance their dislikes, but they're obedient to their hatreds.

I'll try to do what seems to be necessary, but I'm grateful to the university for being a step that takes time.  I'm glad that I'm not in a position where I presently have to be bootstrapping an organization.  I'm not looking forward to it.

Once, while playing [[The-Viceroy]], I got an achievement that I didn't earn.  The 'Objective Approach' achievement activated even though it was only after that point where I started playing in a slower, more objective-focused way.  I didn't start thinking about what the objectives were until the morning where I saw that I seemed to have earned the 'Objective Approach' achievement mysteriously and retroactively.

I could've earned it the very next day, but would I have?  At that point I was still playing the game with a constant credit scarcity.

If irrigation salinizes fields by causing salt deposition on them, does this mean that irrigated fields can have their soil qualities controlled by adjusting the chemical composition of their irrigation water?
