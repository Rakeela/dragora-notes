11:08.

11:18.  I got distracted reading someone's takedown of an AI art piece touting pastoral living... with numerous flaws in the image.  My favorite one was an exterior window that showed more exterior on the other side.

13:03.  No Man's Sky is pretty unstable.  My hyperdrive is getting awesome though, I can jump a long, long way.

14:07.  I can't focus on writing.  I'm trying.  It's...  not connecting.  There's a flow that isn't happening here.  I have a headache.  I feel like I have something lodged in that bit of my mind, and it hurts.

14:08.  Headache medicine taken.  41,922.

14:20.  No Man's Sky is really bad for writing.  Playing it doesn't suffuse me with writing inspiration.  Some games do!  This one is just...  bleh.  No, not bleh.  It's addictive.  It makes me want to play No Man's Sky.  It's highly rewarding.  It's much better than I had remembered.  No, not better.  It's much more enjoyable than I had remembered.  Is that better?  It costs more time.  It doesn't yield up the inspiration I need to write.

14:21.  42,109.

14:58.  42,816.  894 words of progress.  I feel so lazy.  It's annoying.

14:59.  If I psychically controlled the world, would people only work as hard as required for the harvest, while resisting all other work and preferring to build their lives to give them free time to work on creative endeavors?  Just watching things grow and not trying too hard to be economically productive.  Writing books while the fields and forests did the work of their own power.

20:54.  44,178.  2,256 words of progress.  Chapter complete.

20:55.  I have no idea what I'm doing for my next chapter.
