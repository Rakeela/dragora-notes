I've been sleeping like someone dying lately.  Everything awake feels hopeless save that I will likely have an increase in my antipsychotics dose on Wednesday.  What else can I hope for?  The voices scream hatred if I eat things or play games, so I'm measuring my progress on my ability to eat things and play games.

Human history has an anomaly.  Throughout history, people hated "parasites on society".  Yet throughout history, most of humanity labored in what we would now in hindsight call horrifying poverty.  In near-modern times, the hatred of parasites stopped aiming at the underclass, and started aiming at the overclass.  When the underclass was being purged of "parasites" in an ongoing way, people were impoverished.  When the overclass was being purged of "parasites" in an ongoing way, industry surged forward.

This suggests that the people who would purge society of parasites are, themselves, parasitic.

Socialism undermines the hatred of "parasites" by asserting the value of the disdained people.  Socialism's enemies claim that it leads to a society of people who "do nothing" and "expect everything to be given to them", yet historically we can see that socialist nations industrialize in frightening ways.  We can even see that under socialist regulatory pressures in the USA, there were historic periods of massive industrialization.  Conversely, we can see that under the hatred of "parasites" in modern times, US industry has rotted out profoundly, creating... the impression of an underclass that does nothing.

We need socialism to advance in the USA in order to have an underclass that does something.
