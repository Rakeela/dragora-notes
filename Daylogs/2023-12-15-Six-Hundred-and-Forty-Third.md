9:24.  I'm up!  I've been up for a surprisingly long time, talking on Discord and doing nothing else.  47 hours into a fast.  1.96 days of fasting!

11:08.  54,266.  Starting work.  Oh, but...  49 hours into the fast.  Over two days now!

11:51.  54,577.  311 words of progress.  I'm kinda at a loss.

12:15.  I'm going across town to the World Market.  I may buy some sweets.  If nothing else, I'll get out into the fresh air.

13:59.  I am back.  I bought over 160 dollars worth of mostly chocolates, with 15 dollars of alcohol thrown in.  I am now drunk, though the bulk of the alcohol I purchased is too caloric to eat while I am fasting.  Yes, eat!  I consider cream liquors to be a breach of fasting, as they are 'eating'.  Likewise, caloric sodas, so I can only drink diet while fasting.

22:46.  54,680.  414 words.  I guess this is all I get done today.
