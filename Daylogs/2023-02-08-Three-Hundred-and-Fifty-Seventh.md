I ate a moon pie in the middle of the night, long before my morning weigh-in.  I am incredibly tempted to say that it "doesn't count", but what a bad habit that would be!  So it was 120 calories of carb-dominant sweetness.  Sigh.  How unsatisfying!  What I really want is protein...  Bludger it.  I'm sore all over.  I'm also going to eat a protein bar.  240 calories.  Oh my god, what an incredible flavor.  I've had these before, yet tonight it tastes unbelievably good.

Morning weigh-in!  250.3 pounds.  I even ate another boston cream handpie when I woke up, as well as half a pound of brussel sprouts.  Despite that, my weight is lower.

I'm considerably less sore than I was when I woke up in the middle of the night.  Which means, it's time to start my treadmill again!  Yaaay!

I hate my endurance.  I have incredibly mixed feelings about eating today.  Amazingly, I feel kinda like I've still 'eaten enough', and not just in an emotional guilt-esque sense.  I'm tempted to eat, but I think it would just make me feel worse.  But oh, my endurance!  I *can* walk for hours on my treadmill, so I feel like I *must* walk for hours on my treadmill.  If I couldn't do it, I could rest.
