#2024-01-01-Six-Hundred-and-Sixtieth

17:02.  83,047.

18:57.  83,173.  That was a small amount of writing, but it was difficult and important.

23:15.  83,230.  I wrote a tiny amount more, but I mostly did other things.  I have no faith.

(This part added the next day.)  8.1 miles.  1,494 kcal.  31,832 steps.  6 hours, 54 minutes, 15 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.  I think I walked more on it the next day, forgetting to stop and record my total, so I'm not sure how much I *actually* walked on 2024-01-01.
