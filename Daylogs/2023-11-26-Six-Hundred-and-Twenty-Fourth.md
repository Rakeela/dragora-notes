10:42.  I ate a box of cookies.  The whole box.  Oreo Pumpkin Spice.  They don't really come in boxes...  Eh, I mean that I ate the whole package.  They were tasty.  Now they're gone.  That's my one cheat for today's fast.

10:44.  13,096.

11:06.  I am already regretting eating all those cookies.  I want something savory now.  Savory items are much better.  Oh god.  I want rid of all the cookies I have in storage.  I was thinking, "Haha, I'll strike against my cookie stockpile!"  Now I think, "Gah.  I want to try these cookies, but then I want to throw most of them away."  Maybe next time I attack my cookie stockpile, I should just eat one or two of each kind, then throw away the packaging.

15:05.  13,688.  I don't think today will be another 7k day.  It's been a real struggle to think of what to write next.

15:42.  I just ate seven more Oreos!  Oh my god.  I don't want to get rid of them.  I want to eat them all.  They're so good.

18:46.  15,377.  2,281 words of progress.  That is enough for my minimum threshold, but it is a little embarrassing.

20:47.  I devoured a second box of Oreos.  Ah, I was doomed to do this when I bought them.  I never wanted to eat them gradually.  I'm never restocking on them.  They're... devastating.  But so much better than I remember.  Hyperpalatability, thy name is Oreo.

21:12.  17,244.  4,148 words of progress.
