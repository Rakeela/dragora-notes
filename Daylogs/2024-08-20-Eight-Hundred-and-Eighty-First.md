11:48.  39,480.  39,489.  I need to catch up on my productivity reporting.

13:14.  Okay, I'm up to date on productivity tracking and Nationstates.

13:17.  And now I'm caught up on Flight Rising, somewhat.  I didn't click all my familiars.

16:59.  40,426.  What have I been doing?  I've been reading Discord, I caught up on Nationstates, I did do a little more writing...  I'm unfocused, and I have a headache.  Life is uncomfortable and doom-filled.

20:15.  41,547.  2,067 words of progress.
