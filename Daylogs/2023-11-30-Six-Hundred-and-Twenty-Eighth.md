10:53.  Not getting started on my writing yet.  Thinking about food.  I've eaten too much already.  It's no good to long for salads if that's not even what I end up eating.

14:47.  I find it hard to believe I'll hit quota today.  I've been obsessed with food all day.  It's been horrible.  I've been kinda longing to die at the same time.  I don't quite think death is the end.  I don't know that observers can actually be extinguished.  I also think that power tends to goodness, so I imagine omnipotence as benevolent.  So when I think about dying, I imagine the embrace of all benevolence, trying to find the best possible world for all beings...  This belief is modified by my belief that perfection is an impossibility and that the most perfect state must necessarily be a mutable state of changing minor imperfections, so I tend to believe omnipotence makes errors, too.  Thus the all-benevolence is trying its best and suffering pervades the multiverse despite its power.  This theology inclines me to be forgiving of God.  Who I don't necessarily believe in, being also secular.  I'm not committed to any particular God, I don't believe unseen matters should influence intellectual development, and I wouldn't want religious matters to affect policy in any substantive way, so I can be sociopolitically modeled as an atheist.

18:44.  25,814.  1,360 words of progress.  This is terrible writing, frankly.  I'm just telling the reader about speculations in Theoma.  I... really enjoyed writing it.

19:33.  26,467.  2,013 words of progress.

20:49.  26,821.  2,367 words of progress.  I'm getting sick of working on this and I have a headache.
