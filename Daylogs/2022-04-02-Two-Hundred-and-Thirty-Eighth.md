I've been playing a game about a cultist investigating a murder in their evil cult's reality pocket.  There are plenty of alcohol references in it.  Kind of makes me want some alcohol, but I hardly ever drink.

I think I'll have a can of beer this summer.  Literally just one can of beer all summer.  Something to look forward to.
