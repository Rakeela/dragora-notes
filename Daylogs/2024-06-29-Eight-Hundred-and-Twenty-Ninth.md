8:34.  One of my TTRPG games is going to happen today, but not the other, which should scram my productivity for the first half of the day, but release me eventually.

8:38.  My gluttony failed to generate a fully egosyntonic excuse to eat the next cookie earlier than planned.  It sucked though, it was a 3/5 bout.  Not very lingering though.  I don't think any intensity of hunger-desperation can score about 3/5 if it's brief.

9:42.  I am eating half of one of these big cookies.

10:34.  I ate the other half of the cookie.  I'm resisting the urge to eat more cookies.  Hunger intensity:  2/5.

13:40.  I want another cookie, but I'm not eating one presently.

14:19.  I ate another one!  Wow, was it really as recently as 13:40 that I resisted that impulse?  It felt like longer ago.

14:22.  I destroyed the aftertaste of a perfectly good salad with that cookie.  Meh!  The excuse went something like, "Oh, I'm eating a meal, I can have a sweet now!"  Bleh.
