5:14.  Since I didn't create a day log at all yesterday, I'm going to record here that I used the treadmill YESTERDAY for these stats:  7.2 miles.  1,315 kcal.  27,028 steps.  6 hours, 4 minutes, 23 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.

15:37.  I played Stellaris for a bit this morning.  Something very disturbing happened as I was playing.  Time was slipping.  Thirty second periods were passing in a subjective second.
