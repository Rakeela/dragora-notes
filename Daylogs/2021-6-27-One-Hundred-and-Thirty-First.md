The crows are worried about today's high temperatures.  Yesterday they sounded resigned and annoyed by the heat.  Today they seem anxious.  I saw no predators, and I heard no predator-alert calls; it sounded like I was hearing a more energetic variation of heat-complaint calls.  Watching them, I think they understand that it's going to get dangerously hot today.  They must be looking for water sources and places to shelter against the heat.

I wish I could help them.  I have air-conditioning, but even if I could get a crow inside, it wouldn't feel safe here.  Trying to get water to the crows has not succeeded in the past.
