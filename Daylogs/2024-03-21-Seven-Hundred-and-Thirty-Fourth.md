11:09.  I think I'm going to take today off.

15:12.  60,533.  60,981.  I got bored of not writing, and I had nothing more important to do than think about my next bit of worldbuilding.

22:07.  61,244.  I only wrote until about 15:30, and I didn't add anything just now.  711 words of progress.

22:54.  61,791.  That was a very fast forty-seven minutes. 1,258 words of progress.  I'm going to bed.
