11:54.  I ate two bars of reserve chocolate when I woke up, and then I made a pizza.  I ate five of eight slices and put the rest in the fridge.

16:12.  Whoo, I just drank two glasses of alcoholic eggnog.  I've also finished off the pizza from earlier, and eaten a falafel wrap.

19:17.  It takes some coaching to get AI Dungeon to recognize and write for quadrupeds.

19:25.  I guess today is a day off.

21:25.  I've been heavily distracted today thinking inappropriate thoughts about gryphons.  It hasn't been a productive day.

21:26.  Oh, and I forgot!  I had an espresso cup full of ice cream earlier, and I just had another one!  There.  The day's log now records everything I've eaten today.  I almost missed something!

22:07.  I did something deviant.  I took an energy drink at this hour.  It was so amazing.  I enjoyed it so much.  It was just delicious, and it felt great.

22:08.  59,788.

22:28.  60,151.  I came up with a good high-tension plot point, but I don't know what to do with it.

22:29.  I should make a Cybernetic Biostasis entry.  I think that's the phrase.

22:31.  I looked it up, and I obviously don't have the right phrase.

22:38.  After sustained search, I remembered a keyword that cut through the noise on the internet.  "Earthseed".  I was thinking about the Terasem Movement's promises.

22:42.  Cybernetic Biostasis is the term from Terasem!  Alright.  I'll create it as an entry, so I don't forget.  [[Cybernetic-Biostasis]]

23:04.  I should head to bed.  I won't get a lot done today.  Just 363 words of writing.

23:08.  I ate a handful of Hershey's Kisses.  6 of them!  Now I'm heading to bed.
