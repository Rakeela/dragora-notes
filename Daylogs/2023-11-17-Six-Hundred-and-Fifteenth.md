9:42.  47,179.  I did a slight trim before initiating my wordcount for the day.

12:50.  47,563.  I...  haven't been doing anything *noteworthy* other than writing, but...  I haven't been focused today.  My attention has been drifting.

14:34.  48,795.  1,616 words of progress.  Ow, so close.  I still need a bit more to hit quota.

14:38.  48,850.  1,671 words of progress.  That's quota.

21:01.  49,475.  625 additional words of progress.  2,296 in all.  I've been watching anime.  I watched a stunning amount.  I think the entire first season of Konosuba?  As a binge, with Akity.

21:06.  I watched while continuing to write.  I've got a nice, pleasant soiree going on in the story, and I'm thinking of having it be interrupted by a murder.

21:24.  49,514.  39 additional words of progress.  2,335 in all.
