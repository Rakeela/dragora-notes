My diet is breaking down in misery again.  I've eaten a ton of candy today.  It was a mistake to buy it.  I thought I'd save it for next weekend.  I should be stepping down my weekend debauchery.  Instead, I'm eating cotton candy. 

No morning weigh-in this time.  My morning was disrupted by waking up with a small rash.  I was immediately bundled off to urgent care by Kistaro.  I woke up at 11 AM, a late wake-up for me.  I got home with my new prescription antifungal cream at 1 PM.

It's presently 4:26 PM as I write this.  I wasn't going to bother writing a day-log today, but I finally scraped together the good cheer to get to work on my writing.  So I have to say...  1,844 words on the file.
