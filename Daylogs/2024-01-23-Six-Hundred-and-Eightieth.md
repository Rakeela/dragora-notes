7:31.  I have fasted for 1.6 days.

8:27.  4,131.

8:35.  4,289.

12:47.  5,696.  I didn't work steadily.  I worked for several hours, then stopped and went out to buy candy.  44 hours into my fast!  I'm really, really hungry.

13:14.  5,961.  1,830 words of progress.  I'm doing well today and I'm going to go do something immersive to occupy myself for a while.

14:22.  I played The Viceroy as the Commonwealth Unifiers, my actual favorite faction.  They have the Hall of Justice, my favorite structure period, and the Hall of Policy, my favorite influence structure.  They also have a good anti-bureaucratic technology.

14:25.  I favor Commonwealth technologies heavily while playing The Viceroy.  They mostly make sense, aside from the Lords Economic and the Lords Industrial, who would absolutely never work out.

16:08.  7,202.  3,071 words of progress.

16:18.  I got up very early this morning.  VERY early.  Like 5:30.  Maybe more like 5:15.  I couldn't sleep.

16:19.  47 hours.  Nearly 2 days.

19:42.  114 words.  Working on a worldbuilding file.

20:38.  Credit 13 words writing.

21:04.  Credit 9 words writing.  I'm also working on a different file.  814.  722 words of progress.
