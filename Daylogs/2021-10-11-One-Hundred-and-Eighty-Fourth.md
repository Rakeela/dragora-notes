I tried to cook up some mung beans this evening, but I misunderstood the soak step, and then proceeded to burn them.  I ate a few despite having seen smoke from the pan.  They tasted alright, yet I had a brief and disturbing impression that they were poisonously inedible.  I threw them into the compost bin as a result.

I used to have a paranoid fear of poisoning, but it faded.  This isn't the most comfortable thing.  They were actually pretty delicious.  I've had that container of them for quite a while, so I'll pick up a new one at some point.
