12:18.

12:23.  I've got a movie running, even though I didn't really want to watch it.  Whatever.  Regularly scheduled movie night, yo.

12:24.  I thought of another story seed last night when I was getting ready for bed.  Technically, given the time of my last log, I thought of another story seed very early this morning.

12:29.  Distracted by this movie.  Hrmf.  New story seed.  Instead of being an attempt to found a grotto with the cruise liner.

12:32.  The whole cruise liner was built by a grotto.  They were trying to be revolutionary, in a pacifist mode.  They wanted to challenge the whole system of Sol by 

12:38.  Having the greatest party ship in the history of Sol.  Without firing a shot, they wanted to prove that Sol's megacorps were hoarding resources unnecessarily.

12:39.  The construction of the ship went off without a hitch.  The launch of the ship was much more controversial.

12:41.  It was made to draw controversy.  It was made to be visible.  Agents of the grotto tried to spread the word of the imminent ship launch.  They published the

12:43.  Itinerary everywhere they could.  But even before the launch, there was a sign of imminent disaster:  media rejected them.

12:44.  When the ship actually launched, they

12:45.  Started the greatest party in the history of Sol.  For three straight weeks, the people of their grotto joined a few brave visitors from broader Sol.

12:49.  Still the mass media spurned them, and eventually a carrier arrived from ASR.

12:51.  "You are misusing our intellectual property," declared the ASR ship.  "Shut down this ship at once."  The party ship was using ASR engines without having paid royalties.

12:53.  0.8 miles.  167 kcal.  3,620 steps.  0 hours, 46 minutes, 25 seconds.  1.1 mph.  I witlessly turned off the treadmill.

12:57.  I was thinking ASR would just end up shooting the indie cruise liner.

12:59.  The Indie cruise liner was a completely unarmed, noncombat ship.

13:04.  Lancing the cruise liner was an atrocity.

13:07.  But no help came.  No outcry rose.  The major media outlets didn't cover it.

13:08.  The hulk of the cruise liner floated in space.  The survivors couldn't bear to scavenge it.  They kept it as a a kind of museum.

13:09.  Over the next century, the grotto dissolved.  It faded slowly.  Many people had lost friends and family in the death of the cruise liner.  The indifference and hostility of corporate Sol was made apparent.

13:17.  The grotto had sunk a huge amount of resources into something that looked completely stupid in hindsight.

13:21.  The whole leadership of the grotto was replaced.  Unfortunately, the outgoing leaders were competent, and the incoming leaders were not.

13:26.  They feared that scavenging the cruise liner would only draw more attention, too.  They didn't want it to be obvious to ASR, or any of the major corporations, that they had a carrier's worth of resources.  Ever again.

13:41.  Eventually, the grotto disbanded.  All of its citizens moved to other grottos, or returned to corporate society.  The broken cruise liner was left where it was.

13:45.  The cruise liner was forgotten.  The rest of Sol had moved on quickly after the attack.  When all the residents of the grotto had moved on, too...  There wasn't anyone left to care.

13:49.  Although a corporate citizen and owner of a TTI subcorp, Ermolai has a reputation for visiting grottos in a positive way.

14:05.  Third Eye Solutions is one of several TTI subcorps that deal with transcendence rumors in grottos.  Sometimes these investigations are catastrophes; some grottos are investigating ruinous stuff full time.  Sometimes these investigations are charity ops; some grottos get tangled up in ruinous stuff when most of their citizens aren't involved.  Either way, TTI has to investigate transcendence 'off the grid' because transcendent phenomena don't care about 'corporate' vs 'grotto'.  TTI has automated surveillance for most of Sol, ignoring everything except potential evidence of transcendence, but TTI's automatic surveillance doesn't cover grottos, requiring the dispatch of vectors.

14:37.  Unresolved:  Why does Ermolai learn of Sol's hottest salvage opportunity?  Also unresolved:  Why does it go wrong, preventing him from actually getting the ship?  You can't just hand out cruise liners to characters.

14:40.  One of the ex-citizens of the grotto asks Third Eye Solutions to reclaim it?  I'm not feeling it.  Could go with whisperwerk again, sighted from afar on scopes.

14:49.  A whisperwerk sighting would logically draw a better team than Third Eye Solutions can front.

14:55.  A lot of whisperwerk

14:57.  A lot of whisperwerk would draw...  a lot of...  firepower?  Each whisper has 30 wounds.  A gathering of whispers would be too much force to overcome.  I'd have to wargame this in a lot of variations to determine how much firepower is actually needed to defeat whispers.  I'd have to ramp up the team until they work.  Additions to the team would be appropriate, too.

15:09.  It could still be fake whisperwerk, but Third Eye Solutions would need to be able to front enough firepower to potentially take on real whispers.  If they couldn't handle the real thing, they'd never be tapped for investigating a potentially whisper-infested site.

15:19.  The general requirement of taking on whispers is to never lose anyone.  Their MDB is 45, meaning that even azzaBrittania would be taking a wound with every hit.

15:34.  The Whisper's battlescore is 60.  Wargaming a Whisper attack against "fair odds" would involve assembling a battlescore of 60 on the side of the good guys.  This suggests a second rule of whisper fighting: attack single whispers, not multiple.  Hm.  A deliberate attempt to break a whisper-infested wreck suggests that, given dive produces d3 undamaged whispers per dive, the team should expect to be able to fight multiple whispers.

15:39.  The count may be not THAT big though, because there shouldn't have been anyone on the cruise liner to be dived.  Whisper replication should have been limited.  (Oh, movies are over.)  Why were whispers on it at all?  Hydra doesn't take interest in random shipwrecks.  Maybe a few people moved in on the ship.  Other salvagers who noticed the rich opportunity.  Maybe they drew in whispers.  Or maybe they faked whispers to keep everyone else off while they processed the cruise ship.

15:52.  Wait, whispers can only dive vectors.  They can't dive blips and cogs.  Whisper-fighters should be non-vectors then.

23:05.  I could have Ermolai decide that he doesn't need to be able to fight whispers, because whispers do not move in on random shipwrecks.

23:06.  I did some analysis today and I don't see how whispers can be fought at all, frankly.  A mission setup where Third Eye Solutions decides they *can* fight a whisper-infested ship is just a non-starter with my current level of experience.  It has to be that the possibility of whispers is rejected.

23:11.  Possibly further surveillance of the ship indicates traffic to it.  Third Eye Solutions may even be hired by suspicious watchers who want to know who faked a whisper infestation on a derelict, and why.  This mission concept has the problem of 'the early airlock', which is that the investigators might answer the 'who' quite quickly and then decide to nope out.  Obviously, I can authorially fiat them not to do so, but...

23:14.  Hm.  If I wanted Ermolai to end up with title to the ship, how would I do that?  His client may not care what happens to the ship.

23:16.  His client could actually have title to the ship, and after an initial offer of conventional payment, Ermolai asks for title to the derelict instead.

23:18.  Why would someone hold title to a derelict out in the black?   They would probably have some sentimental attachment to the vessel.  Or, no.  They acquired title without knowing it was 'whisper-infested'.  When they examined it through scopes, they initially thought they'd been cheated.  When the person they purchased it from insisted that it wasn't whisper-infested last they knew, they thought their credits were wasted.  When they kept watching and realized there was still traffic to the 'whisper-infested' ship, they thought to hire mercenaries.  When Ermolai pointed out that he couldn't accept the contract if it weren't priced to potentially include a whisper, and the client fretted that the derelict wasn't worth a whisper-hunting bounty, Ermolai can offer to just take the title off the client's hands.  And lo, the client's credits *were* wasted.
