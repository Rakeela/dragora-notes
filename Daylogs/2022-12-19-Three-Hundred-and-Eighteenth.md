183 hours.  153 hours remain.  I woke up feeling very tired, but I still don't feel sick/starved, so I think I'll be okay.  It's like my body was really short on something yesterday, and the helping of cashews that I ate really helped.

184.5 hours.  I'm appreciating the snow today.  It won't last.  I can see that what accumulated on the road has already melted.

185.5 hours.  I do feel a little sick today.  I'm infrequently burping.  I'm going to eat a handful of the chili-lime peanuts I bought yesterday as a prophylactic measure against the sense of sickness getting worse.  They're...  not delicious.  I'm disappointed.  Kind of a sharp taste.

1,706 words on the file.  Today's target is 564 words again.  I came so close to it last time that it didn't change this time.  I left this file in a place that didn't feel like a corner at the moment, but I couldn't advance it, and it feels pretty dispiriting now.  I guess it really is a corner again.

2,328 words on the file.  622 words of progress, 58 words over quota.  This file is done.  I'm going to turn it in.

187.5 hours.  The peanuts drove off the sense of sickness earlier.  I guess I feel okay, health-wise.  A little agitated.  I definitely don't want to be fasting.  148.5 hours remain.  I haven't done enough writing.  It's the most important thing I could be doing with my time.  I'm not as fascinated with it as I should be.

188 hours.  I wish that sick/starved feeling had persisted, so I would have an excuse to drop my fast.  All I have now is a headache.  I have at least caught up somewhat on laundry and dishes while pacing around demotivated.  Ugggh!  I'm so tired!

189.5 hours.  I just had an idea for something that could seriously improve human health outcomes!  I want leptin filters as an implant!  I'm recording more of this idea in [[Imagine-a-body-implant]].

191.5 hours.  I've been studying medical documents related to leptin sensitization.  It turns out there's a category of pharmaceutical called GLP-1 Agonists which are known to have leptin sensitization impacts.  There's also a compound isolated from ashwagandha called "Withaferin A" that caused leptin sensitization in obese mice according to two studies (one in 2016 and the other in 2018.)

Starting a new file.  Setting my target at 604 words, but no big deal if I miss it.

781 words.  I'm going to turn it in.

195 hours.  SGLT-2 inhibitors should also be noted as weight loss drugs, since they cause the excretion of glucose in the urine to the tune of 60-100 grams daily.  That's 240-400 calories of glucose not being absorbed by the body.  It wouldn't keep up with dedicated overconsumption like digging into a candy hoard, but it might help with less extreme cases.
