9:13.  Maybe today will be more productive.

10:23.  I wish I could start my day with sweets.  Fasting for 28 hour spans makes it easier to share occasional meals with Kistaro, and should help with weight control, but eating once a day makes the mornings sweet.

10:34.  39,620.  Not that I'm at the end of the file yet, but.  It's my usual way to mark my intended start of productivity by that way...  Oh wait, I didn't do Nationstates today yet.

11:52.  Okay, done with Nationstates.  Why *does* that take so long?  It's unfathomable.  I do log all my actions in the game across all of my puppets, but still.

15:46.  Credit 14 words.

15:49.  Credit 3,973 words editing.  Tallying.  10,249 words editing.  1,036 words progress.  I feel like that's kind of a sufficient amount of daily productivity.  That was only like three hours of work though.

18:18.  Played LCS for a while, then ate dinner, now I'm back at my computer.  My LCS game is going well.  It's kinda dull to keep expanding the LCS and recruiting ever more artists.  It's kinda narratively interesting though, it's this team of seducers seeking the most compassionate people ever born.
