Morning weigh-in:  242.2 pounds.

I don't think I'm going to do the mark-the-fast-but-eat-a-meal thing.  I understand the reasoning.  "Eat as socially required, but continue fasting on my own."  At the same time, it feels too dishonest towards my fasting tracker.  Marking fasting while crash dieting?  Sure.  Marking fasting while actually eating?  Nope.  I should break the fast and start over.

Fasting over.  I ate two squares of fudge to celebrate.  Maybe I need to eat this fudge today.  Fudge only keeps for a few weeks, right?  Yeah, I'll just devour it.  I had it saved because I thought fudge kept like candy, but it doesn't.

I dove in on my candy hoard.  Yum!  I also ate an ice cream sandwich.  Didn't really make much of a dent on the candy hoard, but I ate up the fudge.  If it won't keep, this was my last weekend to enjoy it...

1,831 words on the file.  2,001 words on the file.  170 words of progress.  This is some of the most hideously slow progress I've had.  I'm so dissatisfied with where the story is right now.  Maybe I ought to restart the current chapter.

5,899 steps.  1.6 miles.  290 kcal.  1 hour, 18 minutes, 49 seconds.  1.2 mph speed.  I can't walk much on an eating day.  It's amazing.  I feel worse than usual.  Less energy.  Sicker.  I got to eat all I wanted, but now I can't wait to get back to not eating.  Maybe I won't eat tomorrow.

I noticed something.  When my weight's going down, I frequently feel like I need to pee.  When my weight's going up, I rarely feel like I need to pee.  I think losing weight releases water, while gaining weight consumes it.

Evening weigh-in:  248.9 pounds.
