In the category of mental transcription, there's a skill that I wish I could just have instantly by magic.  I mean, there's a lot of them, but a particular one has been recurring to my mind repeatedly.  The skill of PERFECT AUDIENCE.

I wish I could be a perfect audience.  I want to just drink potions of learn PERFECT AUDIENCE somehow.  I want to download PERFECT AUDIENCE patterns into my brain.  I want the shortcut to the skill, the fast way, the impossible advance.

What is PERFECT AUDIENCE?  It's the skill of never getting sleepy while someone else is talking.  It's the skill of knowing how to contribute to a stream in a way that excites and enthuses the stream performer to keep going.  It's the skill of really deeply admiring the deftness with which people do things and the intricacies in every performance.

I wish I were a PERFECT AUDIENCE.  It'd be a good thing to be.  I could reassure people that their skills were valuable and wonderful.  I could make fun things better and fun people more resilient.  I could be a more fun person myself that way.

I don't know how to be a PERFECT AUDIENCE, but I want it strapped to my brain a la [[imagine-a-brain-implant]].
