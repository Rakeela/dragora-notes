5:26.  92,346.  92,397.  I am not sure how long it took me to write that before I thought to mark my starting point, but it wasn't that long.

7:58.  94,684.  2,338 words of progress.

8:45.  95,252.  2,906 words of progress.  I'm going to take a break and go for a walk with a book.

15:40.  96,653.  4,307 words of progress.

16:08.  96,929.  4,583 words of progress.  I'm going to take another break.  Maybe this time I'll remember to clock back in when I'm back.

(This part added the next day.)  10.8 miles.  1,774 kcal.  37,625 steps.  7 hours, 19 minutes, and 48 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.  I never came back after stopping at 16:08, though I tried.  I was a bit locally burnt.
