I got sick yesterday.  Vomiting, diarrhea, exhaustion.  Kistaro thinks I hit a foodborne illness.  I think my digestion revolted against all the cheese.  At Kistaro's urging, I started eating cookies once I could keep food down.  Sigh.

I spent the 17th sleeping.  It was very strange.  One span of time was my favorite.  I spent a few hours today in a looping fantasy of being a dungeon core and having a few favorite recurring adventurers who I was trying to build up.  It was fervent nonsense, but I was happy.

It is 11 PM, and I am still alert.  Did a day spent asleep mess up my internal clock?
