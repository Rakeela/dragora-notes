8:35.  I just ate one of my favorite cookies.  I ate one yesterday.  I plan to eat one per day.  I have eaten two; I have two left.  The idea is to stop myself from binging.  I...  if I meant to stop myself from eating them at all, I have already failed.  Also, my stomach hurt as I was eating the cookie.  It's gigantic.

10:21.

10:24.  I've been struggling to orient myself creatively, but I'm getting there.

12:06.  I've been doing creative stuff, but not productive stuff!  I've been having fun thinking about phoenixes.

13:30.  I've been erratically trying to work, but I've mostly been unproductive.  Still, I forgot to clock in with my starting wordcount. 142,992.

15:31.  My productivity has been extremely marginal today.  I have not been able to get anything done.

16:19.  Hunger-related neurosis has been mild today.  I rate today's hungers 2/5, where 1 is a rational hunger and 5 is an all-day desperation.  I think I've had 5's before.  Hypothetically speaking, a 0 would be a day of anomalous unhunger.  I've experienced those.  They're very, very rare, and I don't mind them, because they're pretty healthy for me.

16:21.  I am a little worried that thinking about hunger will make me hungrier, but I do need to record my status in order to learn about it.

18:35.  I have been solidly unproductive.  I got one passage done in Wasteland Engineering.  One passage.  I just never got any flow going.  Hunger level is still 2/5, but I had to remind myself that I've already eaten a cookie today.  I'm eating one cookie per day.  Forgetting key nutritional details is also a component of hazardous, disordered eating patterns.  143,496.

19:37.  I am eating a second cookie.  I don't feel neurotic about it, I just want it.  Let's see how I feel about the last cookie in the box.

20:05.  I want the last cookie, but I'm not eating it.  I need to buy more cookies so that I'm not actually out.  The cookies that I love come in packages of four.  They're pretty expensive.

20:06.  I feel kind of a 3/5 hunger right now.  It's not fully egosyntonic, but it's not fully ravening. 

20:07.  It's definitely not a 1.  Maybe it's 2-ish.  2-3 scoring hunger.  I'm thinking 4 is the full desperation, but when I came up with these numbers, I kind of wanted to distinguish between mild desperation and significant desperation.  I guess I could characterize my current state as mild desperation, justifying a 3.  Wanting the last cookie felt normal until I refused the desire, at which point it amplified into something stressful.

20:08.  I don't normally refuse my desire to eat these cookies.  This escalated from easily eating one per day when I first started eating them, to having to refrain from buying them at all, because I could easily eat the entire package of four.  And they are BIG cookies, too.  Half a cookie would probably be a reasonable serving size.

20:09.  The sensitivity of my gluttony is kind of frustrating.  I feel like it's manipulating me.  I can imagine that if I were a spiritual person, I would probably characterize it as a hostile demon infiltrating my awareness and trying to possess me so that I would eat more.

20:10.  As it is, I imagine a section of my neural network that is hard-trained to analyze my behavior and manipulate me to eat more.  The gluttonous aspect of my personality is a thinking aspect of my personality, as are all aspects of my personality.  I have to outthink it in order to extinguish it.

20:29.  Ordinarily, buying more of these cookies would occasion immediately eating more of these cookies.  I am defying that.  I did eat a spinach, nut, and bowtie pasta dish.  It was small.

20:30.  Pasta is not a healthy thing, alas.  I'm really drawn to carbohydrates in general.  I like sugary foods, breads, and pastas.

20:31.  I don't like pretzels though.  Not usually.  Soft pretzel places sell pretzels that I actually like, but I can't buy pretzels from grocery stores that I actually like.  It's a little frustrating.  I hit up soft pretzel shops whenever I'm near one, because I can only get good pretzels that way, and otherwise all pretzels disappoint me.

20:40.  143,569.  I thought of another thing to do in Wasteland Engineering.

20:41.  I have to do a scene with Skova next.  I really like Skova, but somehow I'm having trouble with this.

20:48.  My stomach feels discontented.  Presumably, I am not actually sensing the opinion of my stomach neurons, but who knows.

21:29.  I tried to read a book and I found myself involuntarily skimming.  I just could not focus.
