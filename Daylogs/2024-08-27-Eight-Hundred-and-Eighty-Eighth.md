4:43.  68,780.  Getting an early start today.  I couldn't sleep.

6:38.  69,641.  861 words of progress.

7:56.  69,886.  1,106 words of progress.  I'm going to try to nap.  I'm not being highly productive.

12:11.  Oh, I meant to tag in when I got back, but I forgot.  I think I got here at least twenty minutes ago.  My 'nap' lasted a few hours!  I really needed it, and I still didn't sleep well.

16:06.  I got absorbed in a porn game for a while, but I did make some progress in my writing.  71,308.  2,528 words of progress.

21:26.  74,772.  5,992 words of progress.  Bedtime.  I stayed up a little later than I intended; my marked bedtime is now 9 PM, or 21:00.

(This part added the next day.)  7.0 miles. 1,284 kcal.  26,891 steps.  5 hours, 55 minutes, and 44 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.

I didn't get to bed until like two hours after I marked myself as going to bed.  I watched Kistaro play Unicorn Overlord for a while (I think that's what it's called), and then we showered.
