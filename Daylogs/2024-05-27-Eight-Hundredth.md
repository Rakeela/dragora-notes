7:34.  79,143.  I feel like getting to work immediately.

7:48.  79,336.  I had something easy waiting for me to write it, which is why I wanted to jump right on it.

7:49.  Fun trivia, it still took me an hour to get to work.  I got up at 6:30 this morning!

7:56.  79,311.  Oh, I trimmed it a bit...  Eh, I'm not going to credit myself with the extra little bit of writing this time.

8:48.  79,728.

13:46.  79,892.  It has been really, really difficult to make headway.  I'm shaping the story as I work.  It's more like chiseling stone than shaping clay.  This bit of it is requiring me to wring inspiration out of Kistaro, whose deep and beautiful mind provides me great value.

13:49.  80,002.  I wrote a little bit more, and then discovered that there was an error in how I applied some of my progress.  

15:39.  I've been unfocused.  Like, that was two hours?  Where'd they go?  What was I doing?  80,166.

15:40.  I was talking to someone about Weld and Rift, and Meratep's Travelogue.  It was important conversation advancing my ambition of publishing four books this year.  I don't think I'll live up to that, but it's important to try.

18:13.  81,242.  2,099 words of progress.

20:59.  I played a porn game for...  a while.  It felt like hours.  I wasn't getting much from it.  It wasn't 'hot'.  It fixated me, but I don't even know why.

21:01.  Just wasted time.  I actually deleted some of what I wrote.  The log got a bit NSFW.  That should be 'kosher', right?  That's how I think.  This is for me.  I post it online...  to make sure it's recorded somewhere, but... it's not like I've got kids following my posts.  It's not like anyone is reading this stuff except me.

21:02.  I'm kinda doing this so that an AI can be built which acts more like me.  So that a world can be simulated which contains my life.

21:03.  And it's funny, I called doing that evil.  I still think it's evil to simulate someone without their consent.

21:04.  Empower people to self-simulate.  Ask permission and simulate close friends.  But don't trap souls by simulating nonconsensually.  I hope, when simulated lives become a technological possibility, that there are laws against nonconsensual simulation of sapients.  That law needs to be perfect.

22:21.  81,369.  2,226 words of progress.  I think that's it for today.
