10:48.  I haven't mastered getting up at 5:30.  I got up then, but I was only briefly active before I slept on the couch until 9:00.  2,022 words on the file.

11:16.  2,211 words on the file.  1,334 words on the chapter.

12:10.  After the 11:16 time point, I went to the store to check on the oversupplied baked goods.  I've decided that I will buy the smores and the red velvet cookies when they're oversupplied and discounted.  I haven't decided if I will buy the peanut butter ones when they're oversupplied, but the issue hasn't come up that I recall.  I've tried all the big, thick, expensive chunky cooky varieties, and I only like three of the varieties.  The basic chocolate chip ones and the M&M ones are not appealing.

14:40.  3,456 words on the story.  2,579 words on the chapter.  1,434 words of progress.  I played a bit more of a climate change game.  I got the virtual reality achievement.

17:21.  Cultist Simulator absorbs hours.  It takes so long to progress in that game, and then doing it again means repeating all of that grind.  Yet the fantasy is compelling.  To be that creative!  Sigh.  I am trying.  I feel like a major accomplishment today is that I thought of a compelling argument against divine authority.  A hypothetical all-redeemer doesn't need to throw its authority around.  Such a power redeems everyone, whether they obey or not.  Faced with an all-redeemer omnipotence, the choice is Heaven or Heaven, and there is no reason to obey (save where doing so aligns with one's individual convictions).  Contrariwise, a condemning omnipotence threatens everyone who does not obey, and inherently throws out swathes of the populous in hatred.  Obeying the dictates of a condemning omnipotence means getting 'rewarded' with closer association with a being that uses omnipotence to threaten and punish people.  That sounds horrifying.  This is therefore a Hell or Hell choice, and there is no reason to obey (save where doing so aligns with one's individual convictions).

17:34.  The moth principle in Cultist Simulator simply must be my favorite.  It is the principle of passion, which I adore.
