For some years now, it has seemed like there was momentum building to restrict abortion.  I'm deeply disappointed.  If a mother would rather abort her child, I'd rather she succeeded, because I doubt such a child will be well-cared-for if they're not aborted.  I'm convinced that questionable parenting is a cause of abortion in other ways, too.  It seems like permitting abortion in cases of outright rape is still widely supported, but there are grey areas that are in danger.  Relationships that are too good to call rape and too bad to call parenting-ready are something that I expect are both very real and very poorly served by narrow rape exceptions on abortion laws.

I'm also thinking about this in a "what I needed as a child" sense.  See, I don't want to be human.  I've lived most of my life in pain.  My parents didn't want to conceive me.  I'm trying to do my best and be a good person, but I've suffered an awful lot in ways that would've been averted if I simply hadn't been born.  That makes me very personally disappointed to see abortion access restricted.
