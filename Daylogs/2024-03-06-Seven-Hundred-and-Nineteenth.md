17:00.  Ugh.  I got up at 9:30.  I have done fuck-all so far today.

17:21.  I'm burned out.  Nothing I could write sounds interesting.

17:26.  I want to write on a gryphon war story.

19:34.  I've been working on defining the climates for a continent in a new world of Veromtai.  975 on one file; 286 on another.  1,261 words of worldbuilding.

20:56.  I've been working on writing a new story.  612 words on the new story.  Working on the 286 file, now.

21:49.  1,416 words on the file.  That's 2,391 words of worldbuilding.
