12:19. Trying to get a new computer set up is miserable! Nothing works quite the way I want it to.

13:25.  35,131.  I've been struggling to get in a work-ready state.

15:52.  36,056.

17:31.  37,073.  1,942 words of progress.  That's quota, but I wonder if I can do more.  I plan to pace around thinking about my story.

18:27.  37,073.  I have been thinking, but I haven't put any more words down.  Also, I just tried to access Nationstates and I couldn't.  It didn't load correctly.
