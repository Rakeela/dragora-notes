10:40.  98,890.

11:28.  98,890... but I've been thinking about my story, I swear.

13:04.  99,379.  489 words of progress.  Ugh.  It's so hard to advance.

14:09.  99,866.  976 words of progress.  I guess that was a good hour.

14:36.  100,235.  1,345 words of progress.

14:38.  100,317.

14:50.  100,317.  I got discombobulated, because I just finished a subscene.  Now I need to work on the next one, and I'm having switching costs as I try to regear my mind to tackle the new variation.  Like, I don't know how it'll sell what has to be sold.

14:52.  I am horribly tempted to be like, "Oh, I hit a mini-milestone, I don't need to work any more!"  Sigh.  I am going to take a break, but I intend to come back to the work.

15:31.  100,844.  1,954 words of progress.  Okay, this is turning into a respectable day.

16:49.  101,245.  2,355 words of progress.  A little more than six hours in.  I didn't take much of a break earlier when I threatened to do so.

17:49.  102,070.  3,180 words of progress.

18:03.  102,305.  3,415 words of progress.

18:04.  7.4 hours.  For some reason, I feel like I ought to work ten hours in all today.

18:09.  102,383.  I'm at a difficult spot in the writing.  3,493 words of progress.

18:56.  103,371.  4,481 words of progress.  This wasn't an exceptionally productive hour despite the high word count, because I didn't write anything *challenging*.  The word count metric is only good on average.  Sometimes the important writing only involves a few words, and sometimes a bunch of words aren't important.  In this case, the content was largely the same in every variation, so there's repetition in the word count I provided.

19:22.  104,321.  This is kind of exaggerating my word count with repetitive content, and I'm not sure what to do to make the scene really count.  5,431 words of progress.

19:27.  104,385.

19:54.  104,679.  5,789 words of progress.

20:23.  105,451.  6,561 words of progress.

20:27.  Damn, I want to be done for the day.

20:32.  105,357.  I found an error that drove back my word count a little bit when I fixed it.  It's valid; I hadn't actually added those extra words to the game, I'd only erroneously added them to the log.  No big deal.

20:52.  105,648.  6,758 words of progress.  I think I'm done for the day.
