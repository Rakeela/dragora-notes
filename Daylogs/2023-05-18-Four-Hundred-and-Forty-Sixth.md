12:48.  I have a history of consuming the "Pacific Dessert Toasted Smore's Grahams" very rapidly.  Once the box is opened, it doesn't last long.  This remains tempting even now that I am properly documenting it in my [[Candy-Vault]].

13:29.  I need to get to work on my editing.  90,887 words on the file.  Take one down, pass it around, wait.  Wrong song.

13:36.  90,869.  18 words removed.  A few words trimmed, and then I deleted an ugly sentence outright.

13:41.  90,784.  103 words removed.  I deleted a cute, but erroneous interaction.  Denziu should've already known the answer to the question zie posed.

13:44.  90,757.  130 words removed.  Got rid of a non-action tag.  Just Ekis being introspective in the middle of a statement of hers.

13:46.  90,747.  140 words removed.  I deleted a non-sequitur from Denziu.

13:48.  90,740.  147 words removed.  Improved a description of some wall art, and I got rid of what looked like an editing error from the prior draft.

13:54.  90,725.  162 words removed.  I deleted an unnecessary callback sentence.

14:27.  My work was briefly interrupted by cleaning work that drove me away from my desk.  I spent the time browsing the Steam discussion forums for "Goodby Volcano High", a game that I'm really looking forward to playing.  It's a combination rhythm game and visual novel.  I'm really bad at rhythm games, so I'll have to play it a bunch if there are achievements for perfect rhythm.  Uh, though...  90,754 words on the file.  133 words removed.  I added a bunch?

14:35.  90,743.  144 words removed.  I took off something I had addedabout freezing to death in the cold, since that's not a very draconic threat.  Then I took off something about a character being unhappy naked, since I want to evade that concept.

14:39.  90,739.  148 words removed.  It's funny, the things I remember doing this time were action tag extensions.  It's like I wrote more and the text got shorter.  Hm, though.  This is happening a lot today.  The work is proceeding, but I'm not sure what I'm doing.  What can I do to improve my focus?

14:43.  Maybe eating so many sweets today damaged my focus.  Or maybe the problem is that I forgot my bupropion this morning.

14:50.  90,740.  147 words removed.  I improved a description.  Remove a few things, add a few things.  More than one word changed, net one word added.

14:56.  90,741.  146 words removed.  I rephrased something.  Kistaro needs me to fetch something from the pharmacy, BRB.

15:11.  Back.

15:17.  90,730.  157 words removed.  I trimmed a description.  I also corrected an odd interaction, but that didn't change the word count.

15:22.  90,708.  179 words removed.  Minor trimming, plus I purged a detail that gives the wrong impression.

15:24.  90,644.  243 words removed.  Further purging on the detail that I've decided is inaccurate.

15:33.  90,630.  257 words removed.  Shortened a description.  More than halfway there, and I've only worked on one chapter!

15:37.  Oh, I know something I added earlier.  It's a two line interaction between Ekis and Ryn that's new to the text.  22 words long.  New writing, so I suppose I could score it like that.

15:43.  90,632.  255 words removed.  Huh, I thought I was trimming more than I added.  I improved a description and slightly changed a Denziu-Ekis interaction.

15:46.  90,594.  293 words removed.  I trimmed out a bit where accommodations were provided for Ryn.  I think chairs are rare in Theoma.

15:50.  90,592.  295 words removed.  I got rid of an unnecessary "zie said".

15:55.  90,583.  304 words removed.  Got rid an extraneous and improbable detail.

16:04.  90,677.  210 words removed.  I added something to (what is currently) Chapter 27: The Paintings.  94 words.  This adds to the 22, so 116 new words today.

16:06.  90,672.  215 words removed.  I blatted out something that gives the wrong impression of a bit of lore.  That finishes up the Chapter 13 review.  5,382 words reviewed.

16:10.  90,589.  298 words removed.  I eliminated a brief conversation between Denziu and Ekis in which Ekis whined.  It wasn't really contributing to the story.

16:11.  90,583.  304 words removed.  Smashed a redundancy.

16:16,  90,592.  295 words removed.  I improved some action tags.

16:19.  90,591.  296 words removed.  "Actually" is another word that often dies during editing.

16:22.  90,600.  287 words removed.  One of the descriptions needed more words.  About fourteen new words.  That makes 130 new words today.  This is approximate, but good enough.

16:28.  90,604.  283 words removed.  I'm having trouble with chapter 14 so far.  I keep finding things that dissatisfy me in ways that expand my word count instead of reducing it.  Oh, but I did find one outright grammatical error; I reinserted a missing quotation mark.

16:31.  90,586.  301 words removed.  Yay, I found a sentence that explained something explained previously.  The dialogue is snappier without it.

16:33.  90,572.  315 words removed.  I'm afraid I'm about to have to add something to the ending, so my word count will bounce this time.

16:34.  90,608.  279 words removed.  I added 29 words.  I'm confused as to why that changed my word count by 36 words.  In any case, that makes 159 new words today.

16:38.  90,595.  292 words removed.  I updated something that I'd done in the epilogue today, shortening it and correcting an error that I'd made.  Sometimes editing introduces new errors.  Only more editing can get rid of them.  I caught this one same-day, at least.

16:44.  90,596.  291 words removed.  I found a pronoun error!  I had erroneously referred to Denziu as male!  Super-secret fan bonus for anyone who has read my books AND this page...  I think of Denziu as male and Aleicree as female.  They're both supposed to be hermaphrodites, but each one has a characteristic pronoun error that creeps into my writing.

16:49.  90,605.  282 words removed.  Did I actually make progress on this chapter?  67 words of progress, over 3,943 words reviewed.  Hm.  Not a good ratio, but I guess I only have to remove another 605 words to get to my objective.

16:55.  90,600.  287 words removed.  Trimmed something, added something, net down 5 words.

16:58.  90,591.  296 words removed.  Removed a kinda obvious detail.  I'm not sure it's bad, but it's a casualty of trimming.

17:00.  90,584.  303 words removed.  Found a way to simplify an obtuse description.  Hopefully it's legible!

17:12.  90,544.  343 words removed.  I didn't feel like updating after every trim this time, so I just continued without.  I've finished another chapter.  That's 3,122 words reviewed.  12,447 words reviewed so far today, and just 343 words removed.  Today's review is not as dense with trimmable material as yesterday's was.

17:30.  90,489.  398 words removed.  Trimming away.  Plus, I changed something.  Someone laughed and said something polemic which matches my values.  The problem is, it doesn't really match the story.  It's not *good writing*.  It has to go.  The replacement is shorter, too.

17:33.  90,493.  394 words removed.  Completed another chapter.  2,798 words reviewed.  Cumulative total: 15,245 words.

17:50.  90,412.  475 words removed.  So close to the 500 mark.  Completed another chapter.  2,573 words reviewed.  Cumulative total:  17,818.  Ugh, I want to stop working.  One more chapter and I'll probably hit my target.

17:56.  35 words added.  That's 194 words written today.  Total on the file is 90,436.  451 words removed.

17:59.  20 more words added.  That's 214 words written today.  90,456.  431 words removed.

18:12.  Tequila and chocolate flavouring.  Bleh.  I mean, it's okay.  I'll drink it.  But I won't do it again.  Making drinks with more than two components is still beyond me, heh.  It doesn't help that I have no spare tequila with which to experiment.  If something is undrinkable, that's it, I don't get more.  I have enough for six weeks of five drinks a week...

18:15.  Those Peeps were a bit firmer than I'm used to.  I guess they're not usually stockpiled.  Their texture wasn't as good.

18:26.  90,437.  450 words removed.  I feel like I didn't do too well with this chapter.  4,192 words reviewed.  Cumulative total:  22,010.

18:37.  90,438.  449 words removed.  Argh.  I'm taking a break.

19:57.  Mm, more sweets.  I ate two of my favorite cookies, the "Decadent Red Velvet Chocolate Chunk" cookies.  I have two more as temporary residents of my hoard.

20:02.  90,239.  648 words removed.  Breakthrough!  I decided that Buryash would make a different decision about something, and it broke a conversation.  I let the conversation remain broken, trimming material from a chapter.

20:12.  90,228.  659 words trimmed.  That's another chapter completed.  That's 4,456 words.  26,466 words edited today.  Plus 214 written.  I'm done for the day.
