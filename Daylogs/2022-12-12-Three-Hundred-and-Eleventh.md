I have been in a worthless mood today.  It took me half the day to drag myself to write.  I blame hunger.  This is my first day of a fourteen day fast, and I'm about twenty hours in as I write this.

I don't know what to write in the story I was writing.  I added more to it last night and kind of stalled because I didn't know what to write next.  I leave myself this puzzle every day.  I feel like I spend more time staring at the page praying for inspiration (I don't literally pray) than I do writing.

I was thinking about taking a vacation day, but it is likely that nothing will change if I do.  My best odds of feeling like writing tomorrow arise from writing when I don't feel like writing today.

Sigh.  1,458 words on the file.  768 words of progress is my quota for today.

1,622 words on the file.  164 words of progress.  This file is done, now I need to start another one.  It's a relief to get back to small files.  Maybe today I'll just do the 768 words...

299 words on the new file.  463 words of progress.  This is such slow, uninspired work.

681 words on the new file.  845 words of progress.  This is theoretically enough.  I'm updating the nanowrimo goal tracker.  Further writing will be considered a second session.

874 words on the file.  193 words into my second session of the day, for a total of 1,038 words so far today.  File is done.  Opening the next one.  I think I'll work on it tomorrow.
