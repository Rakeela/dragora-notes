11:09.  I slept in a bit today.  31,356.

12:40.  31,478.  WTF have I even been doing.

13:21.  31,868.  I've been a little better focused, but I've barely made any progress.  512 words of progress.

14:12.  32,128.  772 words of progress.

16:23.  Doing TTRPG stuff now.  No excuse for the last two hours being unproductive, but the next three won't get any more writing done.
