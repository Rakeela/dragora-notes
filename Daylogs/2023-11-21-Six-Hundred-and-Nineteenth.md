13:27.  

14:35.  Do you ever have those moments where you're doing something, and then something interrupts you, and then you can't remember what you were doing?  I feel like what I was doing a moment ago was important, but the only thing I can *remember* of what I was doing is definitely not important.  I feel like I forgot something I was doing.

18:39.  Day #22 of avoiding sweets.  I thought it'd be easy after 21 days, but it's still kind of hard.

18:46.  I'm going to eat some of my stored candy.

19:53.  Sweeeets biiiinge.  To tell the truth, I'm...  less enthusiastic about sweets than I used to be.  It's amazing.  I'm going to devour this stuff, but.

20:42.  Somewhere along the lines, I developed refined tastes.  Most of my hoard isn't... good enough.  I don't want it.

20:45.  I want to winnow out my hoard, taking a bite of this, a bite of that, and throwing out everything that isn't up to my standard.  Like.  I want to go through all of it, one bite at a time, and not eat the whole of anything anymore.  And I want to eliminate my hoard.  Completely.  Some items I can just tell I'll keep, I know them.  Some items I'm pretty sure I'll throw out, but I want to give them one last try.

20:58.  I want out of chocolate hoarding, but I want to complete my notes, too.  I want to go through testing everything I haven't tried yet.  Sorting it into what I like and what I don't.

21:01.  I want my hoard to be utterly quality.  I want to keep only what I have on the 'Hall of Fame' list, and I want to put everything that doesn't meet that bar on the 'Hall of Shame' list.

21:12.  I took a bite of another chocolate bar.  Just one.  I'm thinking about it.  Is it that good, or not?  Do I want to eat the rest of it?  Do I ever want to have more?  I wonder if it's a fair trade chocolate.

21:18.  Just a nibble more.  It's coffee chocolate.

21:19.  Do I like coffee chocolate?  It's a good flavor in ice cream.  Do I like it in a chocolate bar?  It's distinctive.  It's unique.  If it was new to me, I'd love it.  But.  It's not new to me.  None of this is new to me.  Some of it is unstoppable.  I love it every time.  Other things, I don't want to try them again.

21:36.  I've updated my listing.  And I've started clearing a few items.

21:41.  I've thrown out some items in my hoard.  I didn't need to taste-test them to know that they weren't up to my standard.  I've dug out a bit of lost candy in the process - stuff that I had in my records, but whose actual location I had misplaced.  Along with a bit of indigo gin.  This stuff is something special.

23:15.  I took two bites of a crunchy mint dark chocolate bar, and I already know I'm never buying it again.  The flavors are there and I just don't care.  This is so liberating!  I don't want to eat all this chocolate!  I'm not wasting it now.  It was wasted when it was made.  It was never fit for human consumption in the first place.  It's not that it tastes bad...  it's that it doesn't taste good enough for the damage it inflicts.

23:45.  I binged the whole of Brand New Animal with Akity tonight.  It was SO AWESOME.  I love that anime so much.

23:48.  I've had a few super-extended dreams that seemed to take days of subjective time to resolve, but usually dreams seem beset by... a need for something to happen.  The really extended dreams had long stretches of nothing happening in them.  I tended to develop a confidence that I wasn't actually dreaming during them.  The sense of time passing really poured on the realism.  Normally though, if there's a period where nothing happens in a dream, it'll change radically rather than develop a sense of time passing.  Those radical changes make dreams feel short, rather than long, and they pull down realism in the dream.  I... wish for chill dreams, where not a lot happens, whether they super-extend or not.  I like calm.

23:52.  I think I can go on not buying sweets.  I think I can turn my fervor towards more savory and vegetal dishes.
