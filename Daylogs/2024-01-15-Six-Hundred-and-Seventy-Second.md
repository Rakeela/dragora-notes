11:44.  I'm working on editing Stone and Paintings now.  91,621.

12:02.  91,772.

12:52.  92,015.  Credit 4,202 words of editing.

13:26.  92,051.  Credit 5,152 words of editing.  I'm not adding to the word count as much as I feared I might.  These long chapters bother me now that I've practiced writing shorter chapters.

13:56.  92,134.  Credit 3,170 words of editing.  

14:06.  92,126.  2,821 words of editing.  Credit 513 words of writing.  Rebase.

14:47.  92,353.  4,552 words of editing.

15:19.  92,359.  Credit 4,400 words of editing.  Man I'm getting bored.  519 words of writing.  That's 24,297 words of editing.  That's over a quarter of the novel edited.  Can I justify splitting this work across four days?

17:59.  I stopped working, now I'm bored of not working.

18:03.  People around me have been behaving in fishy ways again.  I eat bread, bam.  A bread meme.  I watch Aladdin, bam.  An Aladdin meme.  Repeated coincidences.

18:20.  On good days, I have too many things I want to do, and not enough time.  Today, I don't want to do things.  It's fine to stop working on Stone and Paintings after getting that much done, but I should've moved onto another project, such as working on the Slantworld worldbuilding.  I did a lot of worldbuilding for Theoma before I wrote a novel in it.  It would be reasonable for me to take 25 days to build up Slantworld in preparation for writing in it.

18:21.  I could write a Slantworld novel travelling between Farpoint Adainu and Wyvern's Rest.

18:22.  There should be a Slantworld map, but it's not in my files.  I vaguely remember it... and I've already discarded it.  I'm not using that map.  I could get started on another one.  I'm not even confident that I'm remembering the right project with that map.

18:50.  I've been map-building for Slantworld.  A vital exercise, though hard to score in wordcount.  I've just thought of an edit to make to my files.  2,289.

19:05.  2,319.  Whee, 30 words of writing for Slantworld.

19:15.  Now I've got my map.

21:02.  2,944.  655 words of progress.

21:40.  3,108.  819 words of progress.  Work is slow.  I feel very self-conscious about The impossibilities of my map.

21:54.  3,220.  931 words of progress.  I think I'm going to stop here and, for once, go to bed before the bedtime that I set myself.
