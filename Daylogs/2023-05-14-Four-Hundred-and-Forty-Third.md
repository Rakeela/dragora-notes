8:05.  86,192 words on the file.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the story today, but at least I can get an early start.

9:25.  87,107 words on the file.  915 words of progress.  I'm making my problem of not approaching the ending in a timely manner even worse with what I'm writing, but it's fun.  This scene is comical.

11:52.  87,992 words on the file.  1,800 words of progress.  I could in theory be done for the day at this point.  Today's writing was fun, but I'm not sure it served the story that well.

14:01.  88,132 words on the file.  1,940 words of progress.  I got distracted, and anyways I'm not sure what to write next.  This is actually a good point to stop for tomorrow.  I started to write one way, then realized I was probably doing the world building a disservice, so I changed it... now the changed version will be fresh to start me off again later.  I think Ekis' Travelogue will be 30 chapters long in all.

14:52.  I'm frustrated.  I feel unhappy lately.  I'm happy when I'm writing, and not happy when I'm not.  I can write for a while each day, but then I run out of ideas.  I don't just stop because I'm eager to do other stuff.  I'm not!  I don't have a lot of other stuff I want to do.  I wish I could write six thousand words a day.

17:58.  89,498 words on the file.  3,306 words of progress.  I thought about it, and I decided that if I only feel happy when I write, I can write more.  But I've gotten to another good stopping point.

19:15.  I walked out into my local community with a trash bag and a set of giant tweezers.  I picked up trash and carried it off.  I filled the trash bag and dumped it off in one of the trash bins along the road.  That's right, I trash pick sometimes.  It feels productive.

19:22.  Now what?  I'm back to walking on my treadmill.  I don't feel like doing anything in particular.  Looking at my writing again, I've kinda hit a point that suggests I'm going to have to do a third draft.  It suggests additional scenes that would be helpful.  Except I'm really super-close to my word target, so in order to add scenes I'll have to find something to cut from the narrative.  There's a retrospective moment here that's pretty fitting for an ending sequence, but I'm worried I won't have enough content to fill it in.

19:35.  Ekis' Travelogue is basically slice of life.  It's not really dramatic.  I'm not sure Ekis changes any during the story.  I'm just exploring my setting and trying to publish my explorations.  Theoma is the land where Edge broke...  It's supposed to be very safe.

21:00.  Kistaro was offended by something in The Tachanigh-Kelkaith.  There's a "said" line that Kistaro interpreted differently than anyone else so far.  I can replace it with an action tag to reduce ambiguity.  We've been talking about other modifications that I could make.  Some of Kistaro's complaints don't seem usable, but some of them are actionable.

22:00.  I should stop walking for the night.  9.8 miles, 1,793 kcal, 36,244 steps.  8 hours, 17 minutes, 12 seconds.  I feel like today was a productive day.  Over three thousand words of writing, a trip out to trash pick, and over eight hours of walking.  I discovered a tasty and very filling keto snack, too.  That helps resist the urge to eat too many of my cookies.
