I once read a comic about a bunch of people getting to take the easy road to self-improvement by rolling D-sixes to add them to their stats and skills.  The comic was about the chaos this unleashed, and perhaps moreover about the chaos that was pushed into this system by the unknown power that was enabling it.  If the same thing were implemented more serenely, I think it might have the problem of increasing people's tendency to get bored and dissatisfied with their skills.  "What is easily acquired is easily devalued," to attempt an aphorism.

Yet I often wish for it.  Not so I can throw down a pile of sixes on a single skill and try to take over the world with instant supremacy, but so I can throw down ones and twos into petty things that would make life easier.  I'd love to throw a 1 into my beard-trimming skill for instance.  That's such an edge-case!  I'm sure a single point of skill wouldn't get me a beard that inspires envy, but I suspect it would give me a basically competent beard.  It would help me apply symmetry to the way my beard naturally grows.  I don't want to inspire envy or compete with the beards of other humans.  I only want to have a beard that fits in.  I'd enjoy being second-rate in comparison to the beard of someone who *really* loves their beard.

Life is full of these little edge-case skills that aren't strictly worth developing, but which collectively contribute to a more beautiful society.  I sometimes fantasize that when skill-softs are really available IRL, the most popular skill-soft packages will be basic life skills packages that help people turn comfortable, ordinary lives into things of beauty.
