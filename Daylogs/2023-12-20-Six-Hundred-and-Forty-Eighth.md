17:05.  60,891.  Super-late start today, but I have an idea to pursue.

23:38.  62,866.  1,975 words of writing.  I wrote in a pretty relaxed manner, but I felt like I was being productive.  It felt a little like mining, today.  Mining out details.  Striking the page until I'd surfaced something.  And yet, I was relaxed.  It was both difficult and relaxing.  I wouldn't mind if writing felt like this more often.
