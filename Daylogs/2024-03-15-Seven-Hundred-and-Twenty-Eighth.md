9:09.  36,811.  I woke up, looked at Knight of Talonia, and immediately wanted to tweak something.

9:10.  36,814.  Tweak done.

9:29.  36,943.  That was essentially just a tweak, too, but it was more involved.

11:05.  38,098.  1,287 words of progress.  I'm distracted, and I'm going to go poke at Nationstates.

13:41.  Nationstates left me irritated, so I argued on 4chan for a while.  Nationstates.net is run by staffers who are determined to inch up the death rates on anyone who doesn't follow their fascistic policies.  I wish it weren't such a nazi simulator.  They treat civil rights as equating to early demises.  They're desperately opposed to even IRL-normal obesity rates, treating them as provoking average lifespans in the 30s.  IRL nations with those death rates have quite advanced average lifespans.  Obesity rates and average lifespans have tended, historically, to move up together.  The game is run by hateful tyrants.  I think the operators of the site pretend to be inclusive and rational when neither is true, and it frustrates me that they run this huge anti-liberal engine of influence, undermining the liberty and justice of a world in which both concepts are tenuous.  They are my cultural superiors, so I'm supposed to bow to them, even if they're narcissists who feel the right to be two-faced and abusive.

15:10.  39,038.  2,227 words of progress.  This story feels like it's slowing down.  I don't know what I'm doing with this part of it.

15:38.  39,352.  I witlessly turned off my treadmill.  2.7 miles.  433 kcal.  9,082 steps.  1 hour, 43 minutes, 10 seconds.  Average speed 1.6 mph.

17:13.  40,795.  3,984 words of progress.  Hah, I thought it was slowing down earlier, but I found a huge amount of additional content for it after saying so.  I just had to keep studying the story and thinking about what to write next.

17:39.  41,082.  4,271 words of progress.  Taking a break.

18:06.  Done with break.  Back to writing.  (I played Nationstates more; no frustration this time.)

21:29.  42,210.  5,399 words of progress.  Stopping to shower.

22:18.  42,553.  5,742 words of progress.  I forgot to mark when I came back from showering.

22:25.  I think I'm done for the night.
