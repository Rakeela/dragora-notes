11:51.  How the time flows by!  I've had a fun morning working on a minor writing project and playing No Man's Sky.  I'm considering jumping to the core with a portal.

12:01.  39,789.

12:58.  I did some planning writing, so I'd know what I'll be writing today.  Then I got distracted with Nationstates.  I'm unusually happy with my Nationstates today.  I squeaked through a potentially dangerous policy with a reduction in death rates.

13:59.  The trade game in No Man's Sky is immensely profitable.  A very few jumps yielded a large amount of units.  However, I fabricated all of my oxygen into antimatter, and I had to spend a while planetside harvesting oxygen.  I didn't find any oxygen plants at all, for some reason.

14:02.  I had been planning to play until I found the next building material that I needed, but after an hour of searching, I hadn't done so.

14:54.  40,495.  706 words of progress.

15:28.  I've got a TTRPG session to run.  Today may be hard.

18:16.  TTRPG session done.  That was a lot of fun!  I'm setting the group against one of my NPCs as a target of a sidequest who they're going to try to intimidate and maybe blackmail rather than befriend as I'd originally planned for them to do, while another member of the group is seeking the aid of a major NPC that I want to make recurrent in the game.

18:18.  I'm having trouble dragging my brain out of the TTRPG context.  It was hard to get into it at first, and now it's hard to get out of it.  Writing contexts can really exert a powerful pull on me.  And...  I love being pulled that way.  When it works, it's just SO FUN.  I felt pulled by sexual writing too, but it was SO AWFUL.  The nonsexual stuff is fun.

18:39.  I'm still stuck in the TTRPG context.  Earlier, at the 18:18 mark, I thought about loading up No Man's Sky as a context break.  Maybe I should?  It's hard to pull myself back out, though.

19:17.  I am not being productive tonight, but I am so happy.  I've been dancing, playing, thinking.  It's been so fun.  I wish I could feel like this more often.

20:09.  41,790.  2,001 words of progress.  Not bad.  Chapter complete.  

22:02.  41,922.  I had an idea, but it didn't take me very far.  2,133 words of progress.

22:58.  11.3 miles.  1,915 kcal.  40,238 steps.  8 hours, 12 minutes, and 22 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.
