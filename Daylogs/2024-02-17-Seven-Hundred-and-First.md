13:50.  Ugh, I've been poking at my phone fruitlessly.  At least I've discovered that a tiny little espresso glass is a good serving size for ice cream.  Yum!  I'm trying to be laid-back while *almost* fasting.  It's a new "eat lightly and be chill" strategy that I think will be totally psychologically sustainable.  (I also ate a donut.)

13:51.  49,618.

14:18.  49,754.  I got stalled, and it took me a while to acknowledge the stall.  Acknowledging the stall is an important step in getting back to work, because if I don't acknowledge the stall, the odds that I get distracted with irrelevant stuff goes way up.  (I started reading about AI Dungeon formatting and writing a paragraph about a friend on Discord, for instance.)

16:02.  50,020.  I haven't been productive in any steady way.  I didn't acknowledge the last stall.

17:08.  50,716.  Steady work!  1,098 words of progress.  I was focused, but I wasn't highly productive.

17:12.  Okay, I'm stalled.  I've delayed as much as I can.  It's time to officially launch the expedition off the map.

17:14.  50,741.  I'm going to poke at AI Dungeon for a moment.

18:30.  I got distracted when the AI model behaved in a way that surprised me.

18:54.  I'm basically convinced the AI models aren't being used honestly by the developers.  Something is wrong.

18:56.  I'm still controlled by hunger.  I ate a Hershey's Kiss and a sugar-free cookie as well.

20:06.  Eating a chocolate bar.

20:08.  What I really want is a lentil wrap.

20:21.  I'm eating cold lentils.  What if the only thing I eat tomorrow is cold lentils?

20:23.  I'm practicing my stealth by breaking up the sight lines on my lentils.  I can't stop hiding my eating.

20:31.  Hunger is still controlling me.  I can't really focus on my writing.

20:33.  50,741.

21:34.  51,075.  I've got a bad taste left in my mouth from the lentils, but I feel really good about them.
