I spent a lot of my childhood suffering what I've usually thought of as "liminal nausea".  I wasn't fully nauseated.  I wasn't *really* about to throw up.  I just felt like that, but less so.  All day, most days.  I spent a lot of time green around the gills.  I rarely threw up, though sometimes it was a great relief if I did; the liminal nausea would go away for a while when that happened.  Everything I did, I had to do through a bit of nausea, and so I spent my childhood trying to ignore a pall of unwellness.

The frequency of "liminal nausea" eventually went down, but I never totally grew out of this symptom.  I'm thinking about it today, because I woke up in that state.  It's strange to say this, but I don't really feel like I got healthier when it went away.  I feel like I lost something in clarity of mind, which I get back for a few hours or as much as a day or two when "liminal nausea" returns.  I feel like that was... somehow...  as close to a healthy state as I've ever had.

In labeling it as a seemingly healthy state, I don't mean to imply that I ever enjoyed feeling that way.  I was born overweight and I have never not been overweight, but part of what contributed to my weight going ever-upwards was my discovery that I could drive away the liminal nausea by eating a large meal.  My reaction to that discovery was to eat more and lean into hunger.  "Liminal nausea" was something that I didn't want to feel.

Kistaro pushed off my plan to eat Huel today.  Previously I'd told Kistaro that I would use a Wednesday-Thursday 'at liberty' day, while indicating here that I intended to eat only Huel on Tuesday-Wednesday.  What I told Kistaro takes priority.  Furthermore, it's the overall plan I'd intended for the next three weeks.

I expect to gain weight across the course of the next three weeks, but we'll see.  Huel is kind of like portion control through hedonic sabotage.  The banana variety had a mediocre flavor and a bad texture; the peanut butter variety had a better flavor and a worse texture.  The Huel food bars are the least candy-like food bars I've ever had, and some of the least candy-like uses of chocolate at that, although their bitter orange-chocolate bar has some surprising delicacy in its flavor profile.  If I don't immediately run out of those, it'll be because I'm saving them as treats.  Huel Hot and Savory is a homogenous stew whose over-blended and oddly 'artificial' flavor is overall reminiscent of canned soup.  Odd because it's an organic product.

I suppose that means what I'd always thought of as the 'artificialness' of canned soup had nothing to do with anything being 'artificial'. 'Artificial' is such a strange word.  In this context I'm using it to label something intrinsically undescribable in text: a flavor qualia and its associations.

In any case, as a hedonologist I don't really approve of behavior adjustment through hedonic sabotage, but I'm still interested in trying it as a new experience.  Even if I'm not 'fasting' I expect I'll eat fairly lightly across the course of the next three weeks.

I'm still astonished that people created a society where being an unsexy man was considered the worst possible thing, and men were expected to be willing to do *literally anything* to avoid being unsexy, and yet society didn't recognize men as being sexually objectified.  The unsexy men were described as sexually objectifying others even as they withdrew.  Women withdraw from being sexually objectified, too.  It's not sex-specific psychology.  Society is only cohesive if there are ways to be impressive other than sex appeal.

I wouldn't want to be a man *or* a woman in today's society.  Universal sexualization still wouldn't work if everyone was sexy.

One of the things that I loved about The Ethical Slut was how it included a bunch of other social and hedonic experiences as the spark and the fuel for relationships.  That's the stuff that wasn't an option in my life.  People outright mocked the idea of doing other things; Jacel did that, mocking things I said about dancing that weren't even about *us* potentially dancing, that being pretty far from acceptable.  I tried to present things that could be hobbies, but nobody would do anything with me, and they would certainly mock me for not doing alone the things that I wanted to share with them.  So the hypersexualized environment that I got actually basically victimized stuff that The Ethical Slut presented as core sexual liberalism, and I think The Ethical Slut is the more 'central' interpretation here.

And I wonder if that story happened across society, countless times.

Men treated lovelessly were victimized for having been treated lovelessly, in a society that didn't present the many joyful possibilities between people, collapsing all the value in relationships to one emotionally uncomfortable terminal value that was supposedly of universal true appeal.  So the men who were taught *that was life* didn't have other things to focus on, or other things to express, and rather than engage enthusiastically under such limited and dysfunctional conditions, they withdrew *as humans under such treatment are known to do*.  And then, having withdrawn, they didn't have other stuff to learn, as the many petty hedonisms that bind relationships were certainly not *more* available to them when they had learned disengagement from mistreatment.

I think our society needs more hedonism, not less, and I'm not talking about free food and public entertainments.  Society needs hedonism that is more intimate than sex.  Sex alone is stoic, and promotes hatred; I may not have hated my clients, but my clients were paying in love, and they didn't seem to truly love me more for my service to them!  I don't think I learned a lot about who people were by getting pandered to them.

I don't know how to fix the world in this respect.  I think my ideas in environmentalism have better odds, and my ideas in medicine are the most promising of all.  I will work as I can; the whole preceding is only that I will also complain as I must.  I will not flinch from the medical pursuit of longevity on the hazard that humanity may enter the era of immortality without having answered the question of how people make friends.  I am sure we will meet someday in [[yggdrasil]].
