15:28.  My bank sent me an email saying my investment account had been idle for too long.  So I logged in, checked it...  There's nothing I can do with investments.

16:42.  I just finished writing [[Viceroy-Goods]] to catalogue my thoughts on the three categories of production in [[The-Viceroy]].  I see myself as a cultural worker, so the question, "What are cultural goods?" is kind of interesting to me.  I see myself as a [[transhumanist]] who likes extreme biotech, so I'm also interested in the question of, "What are biological goods?"

17:11.  I caught up on Nationstates stuff.  That game is pretty hard.

17:13.  If you don't care about the consequences, it's easy to maximize any one stat in Nationstates.  The hard part is in maximizing a great swathe of stats.

17:16.  86,839.  I look at my file, and what dominates my thoughts is, "I love epilogues, write an epilogue now!"  If I drank a finger of whiskey, I'd write an epilogue for damn sure.  At the same time, when I look at my word count, I think, "This story needs one more chapter before it's time to write an epilogue."

18:18.  87,662.  823 words of progress.

22:57.  88,134.  I fell apart with treadmill aching and walked off to do other stuff, then came back and was like, "hey, I should check my writing progress."  That is where I am.  1,295 words of progress.

23:40.  88,508.  1,669 words of progress.

23:45.  88,570.  62 words since last check-in.
