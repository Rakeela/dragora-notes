9:21.  Let's see if I can write as much as yesterday today... but I'm not starting quite yet.

9:53.  0.9 miles.  136 kcal.  2,787 steps.  28 minutes, 47 seconds.  Average speed 1.9 mph.

10:25.  63,319.  Now I'm ready to start.

10:26.  63,324.

14:01.  65,748.  I'm going to do something else for a bit.

22:24.  69,243.  5,924 words of progress.  That's it.  I'm done for today.

(This part added the next day.)  8.6 miles.  1,234 kcal.  25,256 steps.  4 hours, 16 minutes, and 9 seconds.  Average speed 2.0 mph.  My foot hurts, so I think I'll stay off the treadmill for a day.
