I've thought of something that a Mars colony will need to have if it's not to regress to washing clothing by hand: a clothing washer factory.  Dryers are more optional; hang-drying clothing works just fine, really.  Yet I've never hand-washed a shirt in my life, and I want to go to Mars someday.  For me to go to Mars and still have clean clothing, I either have to learn to live without an appliance that is very basic to me, or else Mars' developmental trajectory has to include producing that appliance.

Spinning up a consumer goods factory just to produce clothing washers for every household seems like it might be so expensive that I wonder if Mars will have laundromattes stocked with laundry machines brought in very expensively from Earth.
