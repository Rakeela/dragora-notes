11:54.  I'm having so much trouble getting started today...  I've wasted like half an hour in no particular way!

11:56.  I feel worse while eating regularly than I do while hardly eating.  Eating too much feels bad.  Eating moderately feels unsatisfying.  Only eating lightly feels good, but then I think about food all the time.

11:59.  Maybe I'll eventually get to a point of only eating heavily on special occasions.

12:00.  I started my treadmill a little more than three minutes ago.  I'm not being ambitious with it anymore...

12:01.  Let's see, check my notes...  I was on chapter...  I didn't record it.  I think it was chapter 19.  I did record my concluding word count, so I'm starting with 90,228 on the file.  In theory, my trim work could be 'done' at 228 words, but I need to edit the whole rest of the draft anyways, so I may as well continue exerting myself to trim the thing.

12:15. 34 words of new writing.  90,241 on the file.  -13 words removed.  I'd be frustrated at this start if I weren't already pretty close to 90k.  I don't really need to trim any more, I just need to fix up the draft.

13:02.  20 words of new writing.  90,157 words on the file.  71 words removed.

14:04.  90,175.  53 words removed.  I'm too close to this material.  I wrote it too recently.  I'm having a lot of trouble editing it.  28,184 words reviewed.  Too quickly.  I wasn't focused.  I didn't get my fierce trimming in this time.

14:07.  I'm frustrated with myself.  I read through 28,184 words in two hours.  I was supposed to be editing it.  I feel like I didn't get a lot of editing done.  The material is hardly changed.

14:24.  I took a break, looking at Crunchyroll's anime offerings.  Nonhuman content is as sparse as usual.

17:31.  I tried to play a bit more Stellaris.  I'm trying to psych myself up to either declare the Galactic Imperium (for the achievement), or else to declare a galactic crisis targeting one of the big remaining slaver states.  It's one of my vassals.  They're xenophobic bigots who keep a ton of slaves.
