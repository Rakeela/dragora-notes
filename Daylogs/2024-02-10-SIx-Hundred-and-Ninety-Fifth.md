5:27.  I spent all of yesterday playing Equestria at War.  Like...  All of it.

5:36.  Wow, was that 9 minutes?  I got myself a drink (cola/energy mixture), read a few events on the EaW Discord, and...  that's it.  That's how I spent the last nine minutes.

5:37.  I really adore the Gloria Rising mod.

5:42.  41,871.

6:00.  41,991.  I'm going to check in on Nationstates.

6:59.  Done with Nationstates.  I finished a little quicker this time than I sometimes do, but it still took an hour.

7:02.  I could 100% play a game right now, but if I work with my random tools, I can define Farpoint Adainu, overcoming something that caused trouble for me.

7:13.  I wish eating felt like a mistake.  If I got stressed about 'making a mistake' every time I ate, I probably would lose weight.

7:49.  42,182.  I wrote a little more and then got demoralized, laying on the couch for a while feeling awful while poking at my phone.   I'm not sure how long I wrote vs how long I was demoralized.  If I keep coming back to the work, I'll make progress.

8:24.  42,562.  I feel so uninspired.

9:57.  43,543.  1,672 words of progress.  I still feel so uninspired.  That was three hours of writing?  557 words an hour.  9 words a minute.

9:59.  I'm going to play the Principality of Herzland for a while.  AKA EaW.

10:38.  I loaded up the save and quickly won a war against a poor sad Hellquill.

12:59.  I'm conquering the river federation!

20:53.  I took over the northern nations and the Aquiliae Republic as well.  Now Macawia is in my sights, because they took over one of the nations in my target list.  The next wars are going to be crazy.  I'm really looking forward to them.

(This part added two days later.)  17.1 miles.  3,039 kcal.  64,113 steps.  13 hours, 41 minutes, and 30 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.  I walked way too far and then put away the treadmill thinking I could skip it for a day.
