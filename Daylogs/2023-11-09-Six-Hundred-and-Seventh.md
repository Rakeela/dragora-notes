9:46.

9:50.  26,006.  I couldn't think of what I wanted to say a few minutes ago.

10:52.  26,336.  I got distracted a while ago.  Looking for reassuring things, I think.

11:09.  26,398.

11:47.  26,398.  Ugh!  I've got nothing.  I mean, I kinda know what section of the plot I'm moving into, but I can't make myself push ahead with blinding speed.  I want to put in something characterful.

13:37.  26,772.  766 words of progress.

14:55.  27,384.  1,378 words of progress.

17:26.  28,095.  2,089 words of progress.  Wait, I passed quota?  I thought I was barely making progress.

19:02.  28,098.  I've been watching TV instead of working.  No wake-to-sleep work schedule today.

19:32.  I'm turning in my nanowrimo productivity for today.  I feel down on my writing.  I'm not great at setting scenes and describing action.  Sometimes I think of ways to improve my descriptivity, a lot of that effort goes nowhere.
