9:04.  88,177.  88,172.  Credit 2,559 words of editing.

20:02.  Kistaro persuaded me to catch up on sleep this morning, after I'd done a little bit of editing, and I never got back to writing afterwards.  I spent the time thinking about politics.  I read a 29 page thread and composed a 5 paragraph reply...  Maybe that'll influence someone?

20:21.  88,448.  What the hell?  I only added 276 words.  Oh!  I wrote 81,177 above when I should've written 88,177.

20:32.  88,509.

20:35.  I want to rewrite Kura and Kaire.  The litRPG framework was encouraging bad writing.  A rewrite will take two months, at a naive estimate based on my writing quota, but many days I'll be able to write far more than that through reuse of material.

21:19.  2,140 words on the new file.  2,477 words of progress.

21:21.  10.8 miles.  1,982 kcal.  40,832 steps.  9 hours, 9 minutes, and 13 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.

21:44.  2,431.  +337.  2,768 words of progress.
