10:22.  90,175 words on the file.  I'm sure I can do better about editing this.

11:48.  90,168.  7 words removed.  I retooled a scene that bothered me.  I'm not sure I fixed it, but I've been on break, and I'm about to extend that break by reading a book for a while.

12:01.  Wait, nevermind on the book.  There's a movie night with a pervy group that I'm acquainted with.  The movies aren't pervy...

12:28.  Sigh.  A Transformers movie.  I'm not sure I want to watch this.  Robots fighting each other.

12:30.  If they showed this much devastation featuring organic characters, it wouldn't be considered child-friendly.  Yet because it's robots, somehow it's okay.  I think that's kinda lame.  Although it's cool to see some dinobots again.  I love dinobots.

12:37.  I'm distracted with my book and not really following the movie.  Optimus Prime died, but that never sticks.

12:38.  My right ear hurts.

12:40.  Starscream betrayed the Decepticon leader, whatever his name is.  Yawn.

12:54.  I'm surprised there was a use of the word "shit" in this movie.

13:01.  The worldbuilding in Transformers would probably be fascinating if I were into it.  Is it a universe of societies that advance to the point of becoming entirely robots, and then decay to the point of losing their histories?

13:19.  I've been having constipation recently.  I'm going to try to clear my gut with some Lily's white chocolate.

13:20.  Why would Unicron have a humanoid form?  What possible value would that serve?

13:22.  For that matter, why do all of these robots have humanoid forms?  There are no signs of organic humanoids in the setting for them to be modeled on.

13:32.  Well, I didn't watch especially closely, but I didn't really understand that movie.  I guess it'd make more sense if I had closed captioning on (some of the dialogue was incomprehensible), and it'd make more sense if I hadn't also been reading a book at the same time.

13:55.  I'm passing on an opportunity to watch The Bad Guys.  That movie seems ridiculous.

13:57.  My back hurts...

16:23.  3,056 words.  Something I'm reviewing.  This adds to 736 words I reviewed earlier.

16:30.  Vale has recommended not altering the scene (yet) at 3,056 words, until my pre-readers get to it.  I'll leave it be (and not credit myself with that part of my editing today).

17:24.  A few days ago I started having problems with dizziness and darkened vision when I stood up.  I fell to the ground outright once.  That's cleared up after a few days of eating normally again, but my weight shot up like seven pounds.  Now I'm embarking on another round of hard dieting.  I plan to go even longer this time, but I'm not sure I actually will.  After about eleven days of hard dieting, I developed that problem with having difficulty when standing, and Kistaro said that probably meant my blood pressure was low.  Is it appropriate to continue a diet when blood pressure anomalies develop, or does that signal an appropriate time to stop for a few days?

17:26.  I didn't really eat normally.  I ate pretty heavily.  I don't have a "normal" anymore.
