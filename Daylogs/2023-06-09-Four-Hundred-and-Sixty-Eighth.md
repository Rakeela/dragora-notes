7:28.  I may've been awake ten minutes so far.  Getting up this morning was hard; I was slipping in and out of consciousness since 5:30.

12:01.  I've been working for hours studying and correcting my story.  I kinda hate this litRPG system that I devised.  I've got a new tracking tool and I've adjusted Kura's sheet at every instance where it arises.  I've adjusted two of the instances where Kaire's sheet is displayed.\

12:55.  Yesterday I ended at 71,556 words on the file.  Presently, after today's editing, I have 71,638.  That's 82 words of progress.

12:58.  Mostly I've been editing.  I've asked how to score the editing on the discord server where I learned to score my editing at all.

13:02.  I'm going to take a break and try a new strategy game.

15:18.  That was enough of a break.  

16:34.  72,333.  1,691 words on the chapter.  695 words of progress.  Not sure if I'll hit quota today.  This morning's work, while arguably important, didn't have a high words-per-hour rating.

16:50.  72,345.  1,703 words on the chapter.  High-impact moment.  Gotta decide if a gryphon war is going to happen or be averted.

16:53.  I'm really torn.  This is kind of the conflict of the climax of the first novel of a hypothetical Kura and Kaire series.  They've got to move *towards* war at this point, but the actual war may then happen wholly, partially, or not at all.  Whatever happens, I want King Greeve to acquire his second gryphon tribe out of this.  Kaire's artistic abilities must play a role, which pushes away from the war happening wholly.  So how does a war happen partially, or how does an artist prevent a war from happening at all, while nevertheless achieving the annexation of a neighboring tribe?  I'm leaning towards the war happening 'partially', so that art can be shown having a mitigating impact.  But then I have to plan for the impact of art.

18:11.  73,241.  2,580 words on the chapter.  1,685 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  It's hard to continue on this.  This isn't a day for missing quota, but it's a day where I won't hit any records.

18:14.  I like what I've written, it's just difficult to proceed.  The story gets complex here.
