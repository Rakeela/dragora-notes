I wish my relationship with Jacel had worked out.  Jacel did something that I still marvel at in hindsight.  Sie was the only person to ever realize in any specific moment that I didn't want sex.  Jacel alone called off a scene for my sake.

Even Kistaro never did that!  Kistaro never wanted sex very often, so I didn't feel ill-used, but zie didn't get it right the way Jacel did that one time.

Kistaro is one of the two other people who've ever seemed to realize I didn't want sex, but in the other two cases these were more general realizations.  KIstaro never demanded much sex and was much more comfortable to me as a result.

Nander is the last of the three people to realize that I didn't want sex.  Sie once criticized me for... not wanting enough sex.  I did my best to keep up with Nander's libido after that, and I failed.  That criticism and subsequent failure propelled me to try to put out more in all subsequent relationships.  In hindsight I feel that I was unlucky to first meet someone who criticized rather than affirmed this trait.  I still love Nander, mind you.

Every time someone has realized that I didn't want sex, they became eternally memorable to me.

I 'get' that it'll never happen, but I wish I could meet Jacel again someday so I can tell hir how I feel about the one time sie called off a scene that I wasn't enjoying, purely because I didn't seem to be enjoying it.

I think I've mentioned this in an earlier post.  If so, this records when I was thinking about it again.
