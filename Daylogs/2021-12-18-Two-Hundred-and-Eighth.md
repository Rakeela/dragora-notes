#2021-12-18-Two-Hundred-and-Eighth

I'm upset at the Freefall comic.  In its comic on 2021-12-15 (Wednesday), it had a high-sympathy character say, "There's really only one core value.  Make life better for the next generation."  That is philosophically invalid.  It runs in a tight loop while negating everyone who says it, since they're never part of the next generation themselves.  I see it as nihilistic due to it being negated for not just a particular speaker (who might be speaking selflessly), but indeed for *all possible holders of the value*.  A society where that value *runs* in a tight loop is a society *without values*, being hence, nihilistic.

I don't think kids should be subject to a society with invalid values like that.  I think finding core values is itself a more primordial core value.  It frustrates me that natalists seem to see life as viruses see life: with no purpose other than to reproduce and no font of meaning other than to have children.
