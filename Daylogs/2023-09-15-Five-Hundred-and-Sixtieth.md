11:34.  I don't want to write.  I think that's why I've been starting so late and breaking so easily.  Greeve's Ambition is a good story, but I don't want to write.

12:41.  I played a bit more Starfield despite intending to play none tonight.  I'm surveying Gagarin.

12:42.  41,191.  

13:08.  41,527.

14:15.  41,919.  I've been distracted for a while.  I'm going to go play Starfield again for 44 minutes.

15:05.  I'm tired of LCS now that I've won it several times, including by an edge strat.  When will I get tired of Starfield?  I'm afraid I may be one of those players who plays through the New Game Plus five times.

16:16.  42,911.  1,720 words of progress.  That's quota, but...  Ugh.  I'm in a difficult scene for the politics of it and I'm not sure what to write to make it turn out the way I want.

16:18.  42,951.  I found a continuation.  Now what?
