10:21.  I tend to feel really good if I set huge wordcounts in a day, but I have to work long hours to do it.  This means I tend to feel really good if I work long hours.  I often don't work long hours.  I often don't feel really good.  I'm not a workaholic, but some of my friends think I am.  Would I be happier if I were?

10:31.  121,665.  I very distractedly started work a few minutes before my 10:21 post, but I failed to upload my starting word count, and I've only written like a sentence since then.

11:43.  I got very distracted and did not actually continue writing!

12:48.  122,669.  I have been writing since my last timepoint.

12:58.  122,805.

17:00.  124,620.  I've been working steadily.

17:01.  A part of my writing that was really stymying me finally fell to my continuing efforts.  2,955 words of progress.

19:11.  124,625.  2,960 words of progress.

20:04.  125,105.  3,440 words of progress.  I thiiink I'm going to consider myself done for the day.
