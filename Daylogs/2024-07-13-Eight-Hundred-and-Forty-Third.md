10:55.  84,708.,  84,761.  I forgot to clock in at the start, but I didn't get far before remembering.  I have TTRPG stuff today that's probably going to crimp my productivity, but I want to write a little bit first.

11:55.  I think I was productive until 11:30 or so.  My TTRPG stuff seems to be limited.

13:28.  85,443.  I just got back from going to Derby Days again for some more sweets.  The chocolate conos are all sold out; I should've gotten one earlier!

22:32.  85,834.  I didn't work on this much today, in all.
