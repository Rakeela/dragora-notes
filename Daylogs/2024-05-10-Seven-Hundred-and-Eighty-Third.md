0:42.  My mood took a swing towards the depressive, and I stayed up too late.  This happens.  When I'm depressed, my symptoms alleviate in the very late hours, making further wakefulness more tempting than sleep.  Now I'm heading to bed.

13:56.  30,928.

19:38.  32,795.  2,668 words of progress.  It doesn't feel like fast work, but I'm progressing steadily.  My current milestone was estimated to be completed tomorrow.  If I push, I think I can finish it tonight.
