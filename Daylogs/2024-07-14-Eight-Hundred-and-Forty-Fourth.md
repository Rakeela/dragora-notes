10:15.  Trying to make myself write...

10:22.  Made myself catch up on tallying progress.

10:48.  I went out and got something tasty to shore up my mood.  Yay bavarian cream donut!  Only good kind of donut, though a few exceptional bakeries can make the other kinds seem worth it.  Bismarks are the only kind of good grocery store donut, though.

10:49.  85,834.  85,839.  I started two minutes ago.

10:56.  I've gotten distracted by a discussion of politics and literature.

11:53.  86,143.  I've been distracted and making progress slowly over the last hour.  I'm going to break and play Nationstates.

20:33.  I never got back to writing.  I don't know exactly what I did after playing Nationstates, but surely not much.  Eventually, I played TTRPGs until a bit less than twenty minutes ago, and I've just been recovering since then.
