13:13.  7,453 words.  Spaceraptor!

14:07.  7,453 words.  It's been long enough since I worked on this that I don't remember what I was doing.

14:43.  7,537.  It's really hard to make forward progress on this story.

14:45.  7,585.  Preparing to rebase downwards by eliminating some items.

15:07.  7,073.  Rebase!  132 words of progress.

20:49.  7,563.  490 words.  622 words of progress.

23:02.  I'm really quite satisfied with the progress I made in Spaceraptor today.  It doesn't sound like a lot, but it's hard to advance this story, so every bit of progress is precious.  It helps that it's a small project, so I'm quite a ways into it at only 7,563 words.
