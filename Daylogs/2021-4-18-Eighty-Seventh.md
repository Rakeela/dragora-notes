My dear Kettikita has a spot of health research advice for Earth: research e-stim/exercise combinations.  Try to modify how the heart responds to training.

No results are guaranteed.  It's just a source of hypotheses.  How does electrically controlling the heart rate affect endurance and the development of endurance?  Could the heart be trained in ways that improve outcomes for heart disease sufferers?  How about ways that improve outcomes for athletes?

I'm attributing this to Kettikita, because even though I can readily conceive of testable hypotheses from this concept, it's off the edge of the map that I want to explore.

A lot of fantasies skip to the objective without thinking of the 'how'.  Writing a story from an objective then involves a lot of thinking back from the objective to reconstruct the method.

Potentially nonsensical thoughts: is it possible to construct something which only probably exists, within the overlapping fields of particles whose relative position is stabilized by a crystalline structure?  What patterns can exist in the fields that surround each particle?  How are those patterns modified by interaction with nearby particles?

Related nonsensical thought:  Can machines be made of virtual particles?

Presumptively fictitious thought:  Every world is infinetismal in every other world.

I've always rarely heard music never made on Earth.  Today's music has been unusually good.  A sound like a strange drum featured, somehow both breathy and powerful.  I think it was like percussion powered by air pressure releases... but I'm not a musician, and I may have misjudged it.

I am badly sleep-deprived right now.

I have a personal setting full of stable immortals.  It is not generally possible in that setting for reproduction to occur without the consent of at least three parties, and the magics involved are one of the setting's greater dangers.  Reproduction in the setting has nothing to do with instinct and can never be a consequence of rape.

One of the petty things I like about it is that it can develop no tradition of sapient sacrifice.

This is because the setting contains no unplanned children and no unwanted children; it has no surplus children and no unsustainable children.  Sacrificing humans is something that human cultures did, because the rate at which they produced humans was not controllable.  It's best not to think too hard about what this implies for the sexual mores of prior human societies... and concomitantly, it's best not to think too hard about what kind of things historically kept human populations from increasing, nor what kind of things societies took up in the evolutionarily favored struggle to outreproduce each other.  Child sacrifice was one of those adaptations in both senses: it was a technology of population control.  By sacrificing children, human societies could be more natalistic.

If every child was a miracle...  Well, as a metaphor, it's an excuse and a lie.  I don't approve of state religion and I don't think it protects the well-being of children.  Could it be literal, it would be paradisic.

My currently favored personal setting is not governed by the commandment of "go forth and multiply," it is instead governed by the commandment of "find meaning in eternal life."  So the populations barely grow, but they love each other, and they develop a lot of artisans.
