While arguing with presences has been deeply unfun in the main, they seem to be creative.  One of the storylines that they put together involved a species who had been engineered for absolute minimal size of sapient beings.  The presences... eventually admitted that the story flouted physics so much that it couldn't possibly be true, even though they longed for some weird story or other to *be* true.  I reconstructed their narrative by suggesting that the size-minimized beings were actually tiny clusters of nanites.  They were still an experiment on minimizing the size of sapience that way, but it justified why they'd be kind of dumb and fragile (as the narrative had then relied upon already).

A problem arose in the narrative that I'd reconstructed for them when the dumb and fragile nanite collective needed to make peace with a more traditional mono-mind nanite collective that was a swarm intelligence without the size-minimized obsession for producing as many different intellects as possible.  The narrative we were working on together had at that point suggested that one of the nanite clusters was exceptionally good at mind-interface tasks, and the collective (the dumb myriad one) needed that talent a lot, so they'd started producing a billion of her.  ('The presences', aka my no-longer-functional subconscious, want me to say that they named the good-interfacing cluster Madison.  Thanks, guys.)  I suggested that the heavily replicated cluster with its advanced resilience could be brought together into a new kind of mind that met the needs of the collective: a 'new type general' that would create a mono-mind swarm which would no longer be dumb and fragile like the others, while also being smart enough to stand its ground.

Even though the objective was to make peace, the size-minimizers needed to be able to survive long enough to see an armistice.  It wasn't looking favorable for them in the story if they let the other guys dictate terms.  Both of the swarm collective societies had their own sins, and if they came to an even compromise, they would tend to give up what was worst about themselves to secure a lasting peace.  That was what we'd decided in the narrative.
