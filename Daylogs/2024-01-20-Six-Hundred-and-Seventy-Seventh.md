11:22.  I've been working for a few minutes, but I forgot to immediately record a time point.  93,597.

12:01.  93,940.  343 words of writing.  Credit 444 words of editing.

14:30.  93,800.  I don't know how much editing to credit.

14:31.  That should be everything to finish the last note in my editing.  I guess I have to admit it took five days.

14:42.  93,881.  424 words of writing.  I'm going to credit another 140 words of editing.  584 words of editing.

17:08.  I worked steadily for a few hours, completed one thing, and then lost all steam.  I've been studying worldbuilding since then.  Not actually worldbuilding, just studying it conceptually, by reading a book of random dice tables.

17:17.  Let's try acting on some of what I just studied.  4,338.

17:34.  4,564.  226 words of writing.

17:50.  Oh, I forgot to make a new timepoint.  Opening a new file.  0.

19:19.  1,790 words.  2,016 words of writing.

19:23.  Switching focuses.  Back to the 4,564 file.

20:00.  4,897.  333 words.  2,349 words of writing.

20:45.  I read a book!  I finished a book today.  Most of it.  It's a DMing aid, so I didn't feel compelled to read every last page before deciding that I'd finished the book.  It's full of ideas about how to build settings and how to write magic, both of which may be useful for me in writing Ord.
