I ate brussel sprouts today.  I've eaten an Atkins peanut butter candy.  I've drank lots of fluids.  Tonight's weigh-in is likely to be higher than this morning's.

Kistaro had a scare with blood tests showing potential liver damage.  This was eventually updated to a scare with blood tests showing evidence of protein deficiency.  I'm scared about my fasting!  So I bought and ate some fava bean salad from QFC.  That's quite a bit of food...  Today, my weight is going to go up from the morning weigh-in.

I've bought some vodka to be my next booze after I deplete the rum I've got.  The rum looked to be the cheapest thing on the shelf last time I looked, but I spotted something cheaper this time.  I thought I'd never buy vodka again, but since I'm only drinking it for my health with no concern for the flavor, I figure I should go ahead and try it.  If it's intolerable, the additional cost of the rum is very small.

I read a news article recently - yesterday, I think - that decried even a single drink per day as bad for the heart and the cancer risk, but I think my glucose metabolism is the most salient risk.  Drinking a modest amount every day should improve my body's handling of glucose via interrupting my liver's production of it.

Looking up the duration of the gluconeogenesis interruption from alcohol, I found a paper tracking gluconeogenesis after five hours that suggests there is a substantial (45%) impairment at that time.  This really reinforces my habit of one-time daily dosing.

Secure in the knowledge that people in my direct vicinity are not monitoring this channel, but wanting nonetheless some lingering record of this idea to be recorded, I want to record an idea that I had.  In order to accelerate my weight loss, I want to keep my fasting tracker running past the weekend and into next week.  I won't actually fast through Saturday... but instead, I plan to eat only as socially required.  I will make something of a show of eating a bit so Kistaro thinks I am taking a day off, while actually I will restrict my calorie intake on Saturday as well.  I will then return to my current diet on Sunday.

I am already using my fasting tracker to track my crash diet, even though it's not quite a full fast.  I think this crash diet is safer than full fasting, though I'm still worried.  I don't want to end up deficient on protein.

I walked 15,600 steps today, crossing 4.6 miles, burning an estimated 782 kcal, across a walk duration of 3 hours, 19 minutes, and 34 seconds.  My average speed was estimated at 1.4 mph.
