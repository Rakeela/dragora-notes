8:58.  I need to update my entries in the collective writing tracker that Vale's server runs.

9:04.  Updated!  I was kinda dreading that task, but it wasn't as hard or as slow as I feared.  140,501.

11:35.  141,411.  910 words of progress.  This is kind of a pain.

11:47.  I have to characterize characters that I didn't use much.

12:47.  142,152.  1,651 words of progress.  This'll help fight the idea that I forgot about a set of these characters.

13:10.  142,355.  I kinda need to go upstairs to escape the cleaning now, but I'm stuck in what I'm doing, and I don't want to stop writing.

17:37.  Wow, I have been tranced out for hours doing something repetitive and unproductive.  Total prolonged mindblank.  I always feel like I got hypnotized when that happens.

17:44.  Everything I do contributes to my creative inspiration.  When I feel hypnotized, I tend to get more interested in chromafeathers.  It's the basic fuel behind the chromafeathers in Wasteland Engineering, and it's helpful because there are chromafeather dialogue events constantly in the game.

18:47.  I ate something sweet.  It's the only thing I've eaten all day.  It's pretty unsatisfying...

18:48.  I manage to install some food antipathies by channeling disappointment, but the only 'big' antipathy I've pulled off so far was vegetarianism.  That channeled morality.  I don't see eating sweets as immoral.

18:49.  I'm antipathic to oreos.  That one channeled disappointment.  See, oreos inspire 'horror hunger' in me.  I can't eat just one.  I get nervous, stressed, and desperate to eat more.  And I can go through an awful lot of oreos very rapidly... but it's not fun.  It's disappointing and stressful.

18:50.  Oreos inspire a stressfully extreme hunger response, but they're not actually that tasty.

18:51.  Trying to be disappointed in sweets generally has not been successful.  I can see shades of my oreo-response in my general response to sweets (they make me stressed and desperate to eat more), but it's not so extreme as to generate an aversion.  Other sweets taste better, too.

18:53.  There's a 'horror hunger' aspect of my general relationship with food, where my response to food is neurotic and unpleasant to me, but it's not strong enough for me to spark off and suppress the entire complex.

18:54.  Wait, can I make myself so neurotically gluttonous that my general response to food gets suppressed when I retaliate against it the way I retaliated against my response to oreos?

18:55.  BRB, going to the store.  I'm going to buy a salad that I'm happy to eat, and a box of cookies that I'll run a psychological experiment with.

19:13.  Back.  I bought some peas in sesame oil that I'm eating immediately.  So the thing with binging is, there are two kinds of binges.

19:14.  The first kind of binge is the egosyntonic binge.  I am not really capable of not wanting to engage in egosyntonic binging.  It feels, in the moment, as if I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing.  I feel good afterwards.  The second kind of binge is the neurotic binge.  The important thing about the neurotic binge is that I don't want to be doing it, and I don't feel good afterwards.

19:15.  I refuse oreos because they reliably trigger neurotic binging.  I can associate the neurotic binge state with the oreos and be like, "Me no likey."

19:16.  Yet lots of foods can trigger neurotic binging.  There's kind of a third type of binge: the half-egosyntonic binge.  Half-egosyntonicity happens when I really like the thing that's causing symptoms of a neurotic binge.

19:17.  My favorite kind of cookies doesn't trigger a neurotic binge, even though it does trigger a stressful state of desperation, because they are MY FAVORITE.

19:18.  Yet I'm pretty much actually unhappy about eating them.  It really is a neurotic binge.  That stressful state of desperation doesn't lie.  A true egosyntonic binge doesn't contain it.

19:19.  If I reliably rejected every food that triggers a neurotic binge, my problem eating habits would be greatly constrained.  I would be happier and healthier.

19:21.  There are various brands of cookies that I am not especially tempted by, because like oreos, they trigger neurotic binging.  I can't eat them in moderation, but I don't actually enjoy them.  It's horrifying.  It's much harder to reject the half-egosyntonic foods that I greatly enjoy, but which also cause stress/desperation.

19:22.  Something else that I thought is that I have to react to the imminence of the horror rather than the emergence of the horror.  Like, if I eat a box of oreos in one sitting, I'm horrified.  "My god, what have I done?" feelings kick in.

19:23.  I know this is coming, so I react aversively to the oreos rather than feeling good about eating them.  If I react to avert such feelings where they occur with egosyntonic foods, that will also reduce my problem eating.

19:24.  My experience of hunger is a stressful, pressuring thing that frays my thoughts and generally gives me nothing if I satisfy it.

19:25.  I bought a box of my favorite cookies in order to test my ability to react aversively to the stress of wanting them.  Like oreos, they trigger horror hunger, and I eat them immoderately, making myself feel terrible.

19:26.  I'm already tempted to eat them.  I hid them nearby where only I know their location.  Kistaro doesn't know I have them, and won't judge me for eating them.  This is very important.  I could leave them out in the open and lean on my reluctance to disappoint Kistaro as a cause to avoid eating them, but that doesn't teach me the internal locus of control over my feelings.  It externalizes the control and blames Kistaro for keeping my hunger in check.  I want to keep it in check for myself.

19:28.  Desperation is a really aversive state.  Wanting something bad enough creates suffering.  It's not really a desire as I think of desire though, because fundamentally, I don't want to be desperate.  I don't want anything that makes me feel desperate.  I just have to have it, despite not wanting it.

19:29.  With oreos, the 'do not want' feeling overpowered the 'have to have' feeling.

20:55.  I'm back to work on my writing, but the feeling is overwhelmingly disappointing right now.  142,992.  

20:56.  2,491 words of progress.  I guess that's a tolerable day, though I wish I could knock it out of the park more reliably.
