10:46. 77,234.  76,901.  I forgot to mark my starting point.

12:12.  78,053.  1,152 words of progress.

12:41.  I did a bit of editing work on a different project, but mostly I've just been short of inspiration.

12:42.  I got up at like 8:00, I don't know where the morning went.  I want more subjective time to live in, darn it.  Time that passes me by too quickly isn't subjectively real.

13:44.  What have I been doing?  I wrote and published a 2k character essay on /pol/.

15:45.  I am returning to work.  78,056.

17:59.  79,374.  My writing stalled mid-scene.  I'm emotionally done with the scene, but I don't know how to close it.

18:39.  79,585.  2,684 words of progress.

18:43.  79,611.  2,710 words of progress.
