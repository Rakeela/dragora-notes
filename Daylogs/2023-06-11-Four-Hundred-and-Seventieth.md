9:01.  A bit of sleeping in.  I'm kinda dreading getting to work on my writing today.

9:20.  I'm restless, so I'm getting the treadmill out.

11:04.  No writing yet, I'm embarrassed to say.  I didn't come here just to say that, I also came over to say that...  I have trouble remembering which day of the week it is.  The only day that stands out is Saturday, and only because Kistaro comes down to play videogames in the living room on Saturdays.  Otherwise all the days blur together.

11:53.  75,375.  2,131 words on the chapter.

12:16.  75,800.  2,303 words on the chapter.  I edited something earlier in the story.  I may have pushed earlier chapters over 3k words; I'm not checking and I don't mind.  I'm loosening up my strict adherence to the chapter word-count targets, though I still plan to use them.  2,500 is a good minimum.  I feel bad about chapters shorter than that.

13:02.  76,377.  2,880 on the chapter.  1,002 words of progress.  Chapter complete.

13:08.  What is Kura doing with this word of war preparations..?

14:46.  78,299.  1,920 words on the chapter.

15:21.  78,841.  2,462 words on the chapter.  3,466 words of progress.  This feels 'chapter complete', but it didn't hit the minimum.

15:57.  79,134.  2,755 words on the chapter.

15:59.  79,169.  2,790 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?

16:10.  79,264.  2,885 words on the chapter.  Chapter complete?

17:31.  80,282.  997 words on the chapter.  4,907 words of progress.

18:58.  I took a break, and now I don't want to get back to work.  Head blank.  I don't know what happens in the next scene.  If I wait until tomorrow, I'm almost certain to know what should happen.  It works that way.
