When The Viceroy treats The Empire as the cut-out section that is just going down...  Consider that the faction which opposes institutionalized sexism is the Orbital observers, down in the bottom left.  That's considered an Imperial industry-oriented social technology within the medical subset, associated with research into artificial wombs.  The game's favoritism of the Commonwealth and the Panarchy cuts out feminism.

It cuts out asexuality.  My analysis is still incomplete, but it looks like the asexual genes are mostly in the Empire, with some in the Panarchy.  The technologies that preserve people who don't want to have sex all the time forever are in the 'hated' sections.  Which, unfortunately, absolutely maximizes the "rapesplosion" interpretation of the Commonwealth endgame with its maximized production of "biological" products.  Prenatal education gives people all they need, right?

The virtuous people eat their kids.

I'm solidly asexual genes.  I have a lot of "fit" traits, but I detest sex.  It's not even that I oppose hedonism.  I don't see sex *as* hedonic... at least not with humans.  Your species is ugly.  I was thinking that when I finish putting together the page-by-page analysis of all the technologies and challenge cures, I'd do a just-for-fun me-points analysis at the end.  I think it'll overlap pretty strongly with the asexual category.

I guess I'm an Imperial.  Really.  Up to and including support for hiveminds, though I wouldn't want to be hooked up to one *personally*.  I see hiveminds as something that can coexist in society with individuals.  Whee, I'm a wannabe Imperial Architect mind...
