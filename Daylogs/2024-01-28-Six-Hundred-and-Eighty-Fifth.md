10:01.

16:05.  Today has been pretty much a day off.  I tried to play Equestria at War.  It's so intimidatingly complex.  I sunk hours into studying the game, but I wasn't able to bring myself to roll time forward and actually start playing it.

16:15.  20,832.  I don't have great ideas, but I want to keep working.

16:33.  I am intensely, distractingly uncomfortable.  Movement is difficult, not moving makes me restless.  I am too hot, and I am too cold.  My head hurts in several ways, and painkillers are being inadequate.

16:58.  20,838.  Come oooon.  I don't know how to write the next scene.  It involves low-key telepathy.

18:27.  20,965.  I did a tiny amount of additional writing, but bleh.  Totally bleh.  It's not just that I'm having trouble thinking of story.  It's how uncomfortable I've been all day.
