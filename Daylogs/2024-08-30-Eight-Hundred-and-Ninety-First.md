12:09.  I've been faffing around for an hour and a half since I got up.  I slept in this morning.  At first it was because I really wanted to, but then I was paralyzed and couldn't get up.  I am not sure when my sleeping stopped being "because I wanted to" and started being "because I was paralyzed".

12:23.  Was that fourteen minutes?  85,268.

17:35.  I haven't checked in for a while.  Let's see how I've done.  87,086.  1,818 words of progress.  Hmm.  I'm a little uninspired today.

21:17.  91,990.  6,712 words of progress.

21:36.  92,346.  7,078 words of progress.

22:13.  13.4 miles. 2,189 kcal.  46,838 steps.  9 hours, 1 minute, and 58 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.  Going to bed at 9 PM hasn't been working for me.  I'm still adjusting; I haven't managed it just yet.

22:14.  It's like being back in childhood and having a curfew.  Except this is 1) self-imposed, and 2) backed by risperidone's sedating properties.  I should be able to pull it off.  I just have to move my nightly medication timer an hour earlier.  If that doesn't work, I'll try moving it two hours earlier.
