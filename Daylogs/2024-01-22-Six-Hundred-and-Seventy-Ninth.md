10:13.  A few minutes ago, I started a new file.  Slantworld!

12:31.  1,597 words of progress.

12:59.  1,881 words of progress.

14:30.  3,007 words of progress.

15:37.  4,131 words of progress.  Not bad...  With productivity like this, I could stop for the day.

18:21.  I stopped when I posted that earlier.

18:39.  However, I started when I posted about stopping (at 18:21).  I'm working on a fresh file, so 0 words of progress, and I'm doing worldbuilding work that I've been tracking separately.

18:48.  114 words.  I'm too distracted, I'm going to go outside.

(This part added the next day.)  7.1 miles.  1,291 kcal.  27,081 steps.  5 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.  P.S. Despite embarking on a fast, I bought ten pounds of chocolate yesterday when I went outside - to Trader Joe's.  I look forward to eating it (not yet).
