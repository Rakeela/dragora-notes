6:11.  Insomnia.  I've been up for nearly two hours.

6:12.  I got into an argument online yesterday in which I dropped facts that challenge scientific orthodoxy, from my own personal experiments.  Modern science around diet and exercise is flawed.  As healthy weights grow rarer, researchers continue to insist on models that only describe people of healthy weights, and the persistence of bad information only makes the situation worsen.  Humans are not calorimeters, and exercise is not a straightforward burn of calories.  The amount people take in from food and the amount of energy that people expend, neither factor is being accurately modeled.  I've gained weight from too little to gain weight on, and I've failed to lose weight from enough exercise that I should've lost weight.

7:23.  32,128.

9:34.  32,670.  Not highly productive...

11:19.  33,436.  1,308 words of progress.

12:12.  33,884.  1,756 words of progress.

12:13.  I'm considering playing Equestria at War.  I want to play the Gloria Rising mod that recasts the young gryphon emperor as a trans woman.
