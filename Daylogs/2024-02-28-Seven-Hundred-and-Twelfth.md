12:56.  Not the fastest start, but not as bad as yesterday.  66,215.  66,219.

13:40.  66,603.  I'm going to stop and play Nationstates.  I haven't done that yet today.

14:58.  Okay, done with Nationstates for now.  That takes surprisingly long.

15:05.  66,632.  I've got no ideas.  I'm going to go post something to /pol/.

15:27.  66,787.

16:54.  67,245.  1,030 words of progress.  This is disappointing progress.

17:06.  Other people write war stories.  I just want to worldbuild.

17:18.  Sometimes I get war story concepts in mind, though.  I've been thinking about one lately.  War is so horrific that I don't want to be thinking about it.

17:41.  67,394.  I haven't been writing, I've been reading.  1,179 words of progress.  Fruuuustrating.  I've made progress towards what I need to write next, but I'm so, so stuck.  It's like walking through a field of deep mud.

20:17.  I finished the book I was reading, then I finished a story in Tales of Feathers and Flames.  Legends of Heraldale is an unusual 

21:47.  AI Dungeon really sucks.  They trained one of their models on roleplaying data, and it's frankly creepy.  I don't think they would've gotten a vast trove of roleplaying data by licit means.  The service seems probably-corrupt.

21:52.  Oh, but it also just sucks at writing.

(This part added two days later.)  Oh!  I finished on 67,466.  1,251 words of progress on this day.
