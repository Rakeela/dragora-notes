(This part added the next day.)  8.3 miles.  1,525 kcal.  31,796 steps.  7 hours, 2 minutes, and 50 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.  I stopped the treadmill when I noticed I'd crossed seven hours, wanting to avoid soreness.

I also spent three hours practicing drawing yesterday, producing a shape intended to represent a leg, a shape intended to represent a spine, a tiny dragon head, and five other dragon heads of increasing quality.  I am not any good at drawing, so 'increasing quality' doesn't say much.  They aren't good.
