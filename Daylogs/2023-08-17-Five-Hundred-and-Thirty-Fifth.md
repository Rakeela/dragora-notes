15:31.  I wasn't sure if I'd mark any time on my treadmill or any words on my story today.  I had bad dreams, I ate too much at breakfast, I spent too long playing Liberal Crime Squad... but at least I got something I was trying to achieve.  I managed to test out the new Augments system that injures characters in exchange for permanent stat buffs.

15:33.  Someone dropped a pile of writing feedback on me.  Honestly, when this happens, it's demoralizing.  It drives me away from writing.  I can't stand to be commented on.  I hate the spotlight.  I'm shy!

17:09.  Still haven't written.  Just finished with stuff that I ordinarily finish in the early morning, plus a bit of paperwork.  My sleep pattern is too disrupted lately.  It's throwing off everything.  I feel like taking a day off, given how late it's already gotten, but I know that time off rarely makes me a better writer.  I need to jump back in.

17:14.  Let's just look at that writing feedback.

17:15.  Hm.  Comments about rushed and telly material.  That's potential for new scenes.  Maybe whole new chapters.  Suggestion by reader that it would be interesting if Kaire was in a relationship that got disrupted by the arrival of 'Ted'.  That idea sounds really cool.  Suggestion that I need to state earlier that he lost his memory...  I thought that was clearly shown already.

17:33.  Still having trouble reading the feedback.  I have an intransigence towards changing my story.

17:36.  I'm getting hit by flickers of boredom.  I'm very dissatisfied and unproductive right now.  Also, I just dabbed my face with peppermint oil, and accidentally smeared some of it in my eyes.  Both eyes.  It doesn't hurt, but it's uncomfortable.

17:38.  I'm really not impressed with Kura and Kaire.  Alternating chapters like this has been an interesting gimmick, but it's limiting.  I want to hop around more in the perspectives.  I want to break up the ordering sometimes.  Inserting another Kaire chapter here, or another Kura chapter there.  Besides which, the litRPG aspects are, while very interesting to me, also dissatisfying.  LitRPG is déclassé.  It encourages tell-y writing and doesn't develop show-y writing very well.  It also promotes the idea of a rapidly advancing character, which is at odds with how I've characterized Deldryn.  I wonder if I could do the entire story with a much weaker System.  I don't know how to get Kaire to be an artist without the System revealing that it supports art.  Without the system, I don't know if I believe in Kaire advancing as an artist so rapidly that he changes history as an artist.

17:43.  Maybe I could use a spiritual advancement system with insight crystals that people bond with.

17:45.  Where in the world would the insight crystals come from?  I can't fit them into the story.  Plus, that's protagonist syndrome.  Giving Kaire something unique and rare.  Also it'd be a total rewrite of the entire story from the first page.

20:45.  37,137.  37,150.

22:08.  38,183.  1,046 words of progress.  4,319 words on the chapter.  Curses, I've spent too much ink on this chapter.  It's overlong.

22:22.  38,381.  1,244 words of progress.

22:30.  38,433.  1,296 words of progress.  Chapter complete.
