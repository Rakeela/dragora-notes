9:55.  Just woke up.  Haven't done anything yet.  So.  Yesterday was blissed out unproductivity.

9:56.  I didn't take any drugs.  My brain just did that to me.

11:37.  Okay, done with Nationstates for now.

12:14.  67,466.  Time to get to work on Slantworld.

13:20.  68,210.  744 words of progress.

14:52.  I had nothing to go on except an idea that displeased me, so I went to write rhetoric on /pol/ for a bit.

14:53.  I'm surprised by how long I spent writing a few essays for the site.  They'll be seen by however many people, and then they'll fade.  It's the best audience I know.  I think of it as the Symposium: a platform for people to talk to the world.  The fact that it's stalked by a desperate mixture of shills and law enforcement officials makes it a better audience, though it also makes it a terrible authoritarian audience.  The Panarchy is NOT against authority, I swear.  The anti-authoritarians are Commonwealth.

14:57.  My favorite influence structure from The Viceroy is the Hall of Policy, where policy experts study the long-term implications of policies.  I don't have access to anything like that.

14:58.  Still, influence structures are technologies, not strictly partisan things.  It's like I have the technology of the Panarchic Symposium, but I don't have the technology of the Hall of Policy.  I contribute where I can, and long for the Commonwealth Unifiers to strengthen so that the Halls of Policy will be active, too.

14:59.  It's possible the Hall of Policy technology already exists, too.  Just because I can't contribute to it, doesn't mean it's not there.  I'm not in a position socially to be regarded as an expert on the long-term implications of policies, nor would I say that I really AM one.  The technology could be fully implemented without tapping my personal influence.

15:01.  I don't think it's there, though.  The Hall of Policy is behind the Hall of Justice, and I don't think our society is all that just.  It's at a shared depth with the Hall of Beauty, and I don't think our society has that much expertise in the study of beauty.  I think that branch of the tech tree is physically real (it can fully and literally exist in our reality), but politically quiescent (our leaders haven't reached for it as a way to improve society).

15:04.  I'm distracted from Slantworld, because I still don't like the idea that I had in mind for what would happen next.

21:25.  69,355.  I got into a long, frustrating argument with someone tonight.  1,889 words of progress.  But at least I got a bit more done in my story than I have lately.

22:46.  70,153.  2,687 words of progress.
