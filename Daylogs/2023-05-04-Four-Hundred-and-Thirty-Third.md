Today has just all gone by without being noticed.  I'm not sure what I've been doing.

I know I thought about Kura and Kaire, and edited a little bit of chapter 3.  Then I thought about it some more.  I'm dissatisfied with the sense of progression created by the System I used for it.  Kura and Kaire is a litRPG and one of its story elements is the progression of the characters.  Kura's progression is kind of okay, but Kaire's progression is dull.  Both compare unfavorably to the litRPG I've been devouring recently.  Instead of a simple level-based advancement system, I kinda want to make it an effort-based advancement system, where stats and skills increase based on what gets used.

I feel so imitative.  I read one litRPG and loved it, so I wanted to write one of my own with a similar system.  Now I've read another litRPG and liked it, so I want to change the litRPG that I've got to use a similar system.  Again.  I'm stuck in it, too.  I keep thinking about making the change.  First I thought it would contradict the basic structure of Tekhnevia (the setting of Kura and Kaire), but then my mind redesigned the theme of Tekhnevia to compensate.  It wasn't a hard compensation, and now the new version is stuck in my head.

The current explanation for the 'system' of Kura and Kaire is that Tekhnevia is designed to feed power into souls for the purpose of creating and empowering gods.  I had intended that anyone who reached level 100 in Tekhnevia would ascend to godhood.  I'm thinking of making the 'system' in Kura and Kaire instead have an open-ended level cap, but instead of people ascending to godhood at a specific level, they have to survive mastering a list of dangerous, self-destructive magical skills, completion of which grants them 1) a mastery of the soul-empowering magic that undergirds Tekhnevia and 2) a mastery of the ability to create worlds itself.  In other words, a set of skills that master the system when mastered in total.  In this structure, there's no raw advancement level that would result in ascenscion to godhood, but they are considered a god when they can create worlds and empower souls.

Imitative, though.  I don't know where the line of acceptable inspiration is.  Some things would be different, many things would be the same.  I'm struggling to think of ways to differentiate my idea from the ideas of The Unbound Soul.

One thing I think I've learned about progression stories is that I need some way for minor, regular progression to show up.  This is the problem with a hundred level system.  I need progression to be steady.  I was already kind of dissatisfied with my prior system, too.  It didn't show regular, small amounts of progress.  Using a stat-and-skill gain-by-doing model will allow me to present small gains regularly.

Another thing I've learned is that seeing the status screen is really cool.  It challenges my world design to show status screens regularly, but it's good.

So I spent a few hours trying to come up with a new system, and it was 90% wasted effort.  I didn't come up with what I needed to make Kura and Kaire's plot work.  I came up with something that might be kinda cool for a completely different story, and wow it makes a huge difference what progression model a setting uses.

I did come up with something that I think I can back-port to Kura and Kaire.  What if mana levels in Tekhnevia increase as one goes underground?  That's something I'd be borrowing from The Unbound Soul, sort of, but I'd be using it differently.  I can do a lot with it.  Volcanoes for instance could be upwellings of mana from underground.  Mines could be dangerous due to penetrating into increasingly dense mana.

This might help my progression woes as well if I go and edit Kaire's scenes to include more of an altitude shift with delving.  Instead of having a vaguely forest dungeon early on, I could have a more classical descending dungeon in the forest.  The descent would intensify the mana, but since its a nature mana place, it would remain naturey.
