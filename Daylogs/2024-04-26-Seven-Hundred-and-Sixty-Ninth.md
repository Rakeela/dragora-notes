10:05.  75,450.  I need to work on Slantworld again.

10:06.  75,444.  Rebase.

12:44.  75,469.  I took a nap.  I am still sick!  But now I am poking at this, and struggling to decide what happens next.

13:23.  I got distracted.  Sigh.

13:25.  If I follow the general principle of only working on things that don't hurt me, my artistic range is narrowed.  I think writing a story about a villain (as Slantworld is) really stings.

13:28.  Praoziu shows a flicker of contrition that may be inappropriate, near the current limit of the story.  That's not consistent with her feeling fully vindicated and inclined to deepen her negative conduct.

13:44.  75,463.  I'm going to credit 3,393 words of editing to represent the effort that I'm putting into it.  That's the current length of the last two chapters.

21:55.  76,512.  1,076.  My writing productivity has been pretty dire today, and I've been totally unfocused.
