Morning weigh-in:  252.1 pounds.

Why the oscillation?

Hmf.  I'm going to eat again today.  The way I lost seventy pounds was to eat two days a week, and fast five.  Or "fast", since I was technically eating four hundred calories per day.  I want to eat strawberry soft top cookies.  I'm driven by resentment this time.  It's Super Bowl Sunday, isn't it?  Other people are eating so much today.  I want to be like they are.  I don't feel superior when I skip food.

I just used the promise of my daily rum-and-cola to get myself *not* to eat another cookie.  Sure, I'm presently *allowed* to eat another cookie, but I still *shouldn't*.  Meanwhile, the daily rum-and-cola is something I want to take when I haven't recently eaten sugar, since its purpose is to drive a minor sugar deficit into my blood via interrupting liver gluconeogenesis.

(This section added the next day:)  I forgot to record my treadmill usage, but I believe I walked 4 miles in 3 hours and 23 minutes.  I also forgot to do an evening weigh-in.
