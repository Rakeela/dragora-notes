13:08.  I forgot to add a starting point when I began writing today.  47,912.  49,652.  1,740 words of progress.  I was thinking, "I'm stalled, I should add a timepoint," when I realized that I hadn't recorded my starting point.  Been working since I got up ~3 hours ago.

19:03.  I've been arguing online for at least the last hour, and I think a little longer.  Like 70 minutes.  Writing essays takes time.  I wrote about five.  One was a firecracker about the nature of memetic inevitability.

19:14.  Oh hey, I got distracted and didn't record my current wordcount.  50,988.  3,076 words of progress.

20:43.  52,321.  4,409 words of progress.  Argh, I accidentally turned off the treadmill and closed the summary display, so I can't record my exercise properly today.
