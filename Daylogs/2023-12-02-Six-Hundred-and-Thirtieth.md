11:52.

11:58.  29,524.

13:31.  29,627.  I've been mostly working on a *different* writing project.

21:08.  31,323.  Wow, I really haven't been working consistently.  I watched an hour and a half of anime, spent an untallied amount of time resting on the couch, and even played my favorite porn game for a while today.  Just because I only marked writing doesn't mean I worked hard today.  Usually if I only mark writing...  I only wrote.

21:09.  In my defense, I've been tired, unfocused, and in pain today.  The writing also failed to hold my interest.  I sort of glanced off of it.

21:11.  1,799 words of writing today.  It meets quota, but it's...  uninspiring...
