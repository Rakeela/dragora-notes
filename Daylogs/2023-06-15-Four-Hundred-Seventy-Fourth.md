6:26.  An astonishing thing happened this morning while I was struggling to get up.  I was singing a bit of a song in my head, and I looked at my watch.  It was, I don't remember exactly, about 5:10 or 5:13.  Then, before I'd finished the song in my head, I looked at my watch again.  It was 6:02.  Apparently I'd fallen asleep.

6:28.  Yesterday was highly stressful.  I intended to take yesterday off from writing, but I couldn't.  Maybe today I can take a day off from writing.  Writing isn't productive for me, it's an obsession.  I did have a goal of being able to write fast enough to be a "potboiler", and I'm advancing well towards that.

11:59.  I have been successfully refusing to work.  It hasn't felt entirely good.  Instead of feeling bad because writing is hard, I have been feeling bad because I'm not writing.  This feels less bad than writing, but it still feels bad.  I have still been thinking about my story, but not in the most useful way; I keep thinking that I am dissatisfied with the intro.  I wish I could come up with a better excuse to set Taltios travelling than what I have come up with so far.  I feel like I have no idea why people travel.

12:24.  It's wrong to think of religious people as worshipping "sky-daddy", because their relationship with their god is fundamentally not parent-child.  Any parent who wants to be worshipped is a bad parent.  If deities are conceived of as parents, the same requirement applies, and any deity desiring of worship becomes unworthy of worship.  As parents should not demand to be worshipped, likewise no child should worship their parents.  Anything venerated is no longer a parent, because veneration is alien to the parent-child relationship.

12:36.  Of all the variations I have tried, eating lightly produces the most energy.  More than fasting, eating "normally", or eating heavily.

16:41.  Not that I've been eating today.  I've been fasting, and tired.

16:49.  I've spent a bunch of money on food today.  I've been recreationally shopping...  I also recreationally napped on the couch.

16:54.  To be fair, I also recreationally biked across town and recreationally went out on my scooter.  I went shopping both times, mind you.  But I've been active, and I haven't been eating.  Taking a break from writing kinda sucks though.

17:01.  Grr.  I'm being drawn back to work.  I remembered an error in Kura and Kaire, near the end.  I want to edit it.  I'm going to go lay on the couch again.

17:57.  1,258 words edited.  I couldn't just let an error stew in mind while I left it be.

22:19.  1.7 miles.  313 kcal.  6,249 steps.  1 hour, 24 minutes, 49 seconds.  Average speed 1.2 mph.
