13:47.  97,470.

14:04.  97,642.  I've just remembered a chore that I have to perform.

17:02.  100,153.  2,683 words of progress.  Taking another break.

18:07.  I'm back.

18:19.  Scratch that, I was still on break.

19:40.  100,153 words.  I haven't been 'on break' the whole time, I've been studying the story and thinking about how it evolves.

21:31.  101,260.  3,790 words of progress.  A good day.

22:17.  101,856.  4,386 words of progress.  I think I'm done.  I'm stressed, tired, and a bit weepy.
