11:49.  When I parse numbers, I tend to group up the numbers into twos.  So when I read '1,214' instead of grouping up the first three, I tend to group it up like '12,14'.  It's a little annoying to frequently correct myself into the correct three item groupings.

11:53.  Credit 49 words editing, 20 words writing.  1,296 words editing, 202 words writing.

12:57.  I had lunch!  Now I'm back to work.  Credit 36 words writing.  238 words writing.

15:01.  I got distracted, first playing Democratic Socialism Simulator, then No Man's Sky, then Race for the Galaxy.  Good heavens.  I've also been reading a book on how to write magic systems.  It's full of writing prompts that I'm not exploring right now, and probably won't explore ever.

15:07.  I tend to eat sweets when my stomach feels bad.  Somewhere along the way, I learned that sweets settle an upset stomach.  That habit might extend my life expectancy if I get cancer, but it won't otherwise do me any good.

15:10.  I put in less than an hour of work earlier.  I didn't measure exactly how long I worked after having lunch, but it wasn't long.  Maybe estimate an hour of work so far today.

15:40.  I've been reading.  I don't feel bad about it, but I note that I read for half an hour before losing focus on the task.  It's significantly harder to keep reading.

15:49.  Reading books feels dramatically more productive than gaming.  It's also more difficult.  Gaming doesn't challenge my emotions.  Reading does.  That challenge brings with it a creative ferment that I can use, I think.  I'm not sure.

15:52.  I feel weak-willed and emotionally fragile.  Writing requires facing that down, and it's hard.

15:58.  I am turning in my productivity on Stone and Paintings.  1,296 words editing, 238 words writing.

16:49.  Credit 3,969 words of editing.  I've been working on it as I wrote.  73 words writing (tallied).

17:06.  Credit 104 words writing.  That's 177 words.

17:09.  Credit 29 words writing.  That's 206 words.  This maybe shouldn't count; I just wrote this and I'm rewriting it again.  Normally, this wouldn't count, but the way that I'm tallying my writing today is exaggerating my wordcount.

17:12.  Credit 8 words writing.  214 words.

17:15.  Credit 9 words writing.  223 words.

17:22.  Credit 16 words writing.  239 words.  Credit 288 words editing.  4,257 words of editing (tallied).

19:19.  Credit 76 words of writing.  630 words of writing.

19:21.  Aaand done.  That's one complete pass of editing on Stone and Paintings.  I went over it start to finish.  I could've gone over it a little more finely; I was working to the guidelines of my editor, who left many chapters unmarked.  I skipped over those as well.

20:06.  I just realized that it took me four days to edit Stone and Paintings, just as I'd tried to achieve.

20:21.  Credit 50 words writing.  680 words of writing.  I did a little more editing as well, but I won't credit that.
