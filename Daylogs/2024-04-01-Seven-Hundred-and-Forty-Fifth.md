12:35.  86,328.

17:14.  87,943.  I haven't been working for like three hours now.  I got distracted.

17:52.  I'm eating a lot of erythritol lately.  I want to kill bacteria in my mouth.  I've been brushing my teeth or swishing erythritol after every meal.

21:36.  89,350.  3,022 words of progress.  Oh hey, that's decent.  I'm going to consider this done for the day.  I have been highly distracted all day.
