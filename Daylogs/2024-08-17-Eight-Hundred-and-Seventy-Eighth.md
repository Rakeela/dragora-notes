5:54.  Life proceeds in an endless sequence of creative efforts!  29,877.  29,906.  I'm going to go catch up on Wasteland Engineering edits.

6:00.  I did some work on Wasteland Engineering edits.  I can't bear it any more, I'm putting it down again.

10:59.  I've been playing Bombe!  I got another achievement, but my progress soon stalled out.  It's really hard to fathom the puzzles.  My mind doesn't work like that.  I'm mostly just a language processor.

11:03.  I would like to be more than a language processor, but my next priority is art.  Someday.  I need to fetch my new art book from the mailbox.  29,957.

13:13.  31,173.  I was writing some seasonal events.

20:55.  33,606.  3,729 words of progress.
