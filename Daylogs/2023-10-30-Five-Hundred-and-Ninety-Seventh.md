0:50.  I'm sick of sugar and I'm sick of eating.  I need to eat, I need to not eat, I'm split between the two needs.  It's sickening.  I don't know how to focus my stress here.  How do I make this right?

0:51.  I can't use my treadmill.  I would disturb Kistaro.  I'm sick of sleeping in.  I'm... furious?  If you have to ask, you're not furious, so no.  I'm not furious.  But I'm upset.  I don't want to sleep, because I'll sleep in.  I doin't want to sleep in.  I want to skip a night of sleep.  Completely.  It's so wrong.  In Hc Svnt Dracones, skipping a night of sleep would complicate all checks due to fatigue.  It's not the right answer.  The right answer is...  to sleep a few hours and wake up early.

1:06.  I need to name the novel I've been working on.  I wrote a scene yesterday.  I've been doing plenty of writing in my notes.  I want to credit the scene to the project, even if I might not use it, and I don't know what to name the project.

2:20.  When I eat salt, I crave sugar.  When I eat sugar, I crave salt.  I ate salt, so now I'm craving sugar.  I shouldn't give in to the sugar craving.  I like the aftertaste of salty foods better than I like the aftertaste of sugary foods.  I'm sick of sugar.  I'm not sick of salt.

18:13.  First off, I'm starting Attempt #4 of quitting sweets.  This one won't take, but I said that about the time that took with meat, so I'm just going in with rational expectations.  Secondly, I've tried spiced rum for the first time today.  It was the cheapest rum in the store in addition to being spiced rum.  It's surprisingly delicious.  I can just sip on this straight.  Normally buying the cheapest X of any alcohol acquires an alcohol that tastes terrible.  Even more terrible than alcohol usually tastes, that is.
