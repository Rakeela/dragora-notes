"The presences" have been bothering me about how my stomach is supposedly complaining about my aspartame soda consumption harming its microbiota, so I've gone to the store to buy a zero sugar kombucha.

...and I've walked out without paying for it, stealing it in a totally blase and inattentive manner.  So I'm going to go back to pay for it...

...as soon as I move the laundry over, something I often forget to do.  Thank you, psychosis, for these fulfilling and uplifting life experiences.

Laundry moved, item paid for, two bags purchased.  I'm going to eat a single piece of candy (a Russel Stover Marshmallow "Pumpkin") to further affirm that I'm not spiritually fasting, just doing it for health.  This is probably going to be miserable due to the sugar effects, but I'll keep weighing myself this week and see how it works.

I'm considering creating a public food log.  I can probably eat myself thin by using the slowdown from logging everything and metering my consumption better.

Whoa.  Sudden deep sleepiness.  Feels pretty good though, so I think I'll lay down.

That felt like good sleep.  Wrong hours, but still comfortable.  I woke up thinking something shiny about how societies are filtered towards... something I forgot about as soon as I stood up.  I'm grateful for the comfortable sleep despite that disappointment, as I've been having trouble sleeping lately.

Someone reorganized the icons on my Mac to put The Shrouded Isle Soundtrack onto the second page of the icons... alone.  It was the only icon on that page.  I've never done that.  It would take minutes of messing around to get all the other icons off a page.

I want my civil liberties back.  People who've had crimes committed against them are people who have not had their civil liberties respected.

I'm really looking forward to breaking this round of 'fasting' for real with that cookie in my candy hoard.  Saturday is going to be fun!
