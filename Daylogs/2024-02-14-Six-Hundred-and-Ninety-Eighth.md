14:12.  I felt like I had nothing to get up for this morning.

14:22.  I feel kind of okay right now, but I'm still... disabled.  Pacing around lost in thought.  I want to say that I'm not unhappy, but I probably am.  I'm not investing in long-term success right now.  That inability to invest in long-term success is something that misery inflicts on people.

14:23.  Solving misery helps people move forward.  So does...  working with people towards long-term success.  But solving misery is the brighter, better path, whether or not it works ideally, because ultimately happiness is the measure of meaning in life.  Are people happy?  Then life is good.  If people are miserable, life is bad.

14:24.  I think families should try to attain happiness first, then grow.  Growing first makes life worse.

14:33.  I feel so weighted down.  My head is heavy with hopelessness.

14:34.  I've been thinking about my story, but only in an inchoate fashion.  I'm sorry, Slantworld.

14:39.  45,780.  45,879.  I did not do all that work in one minute; I started without thinking to record my starting minute.  Well, I am within five minutes of when I started at least.

16:35.  47,103.  I've been distracted.  I filled out my paper fasting tracker.  I'm currently attempting an epic 21-day fast because I'm sick of being controlled by my hungers.  1,323 words of progress.  I haven't thought of something else cool to write and it's frustrating me.

16:38.  Ouch!  Freaking ouch.  I'm limping on the treadmill.  My right foot is twinging.  The joint hurts.

16:39.  I got nothing in my writing.  I'm going to play a bit more of my awful Equestria at War campaign.  A bit more of Dawnfeather the Great Conquerer.

21:37.  I completed the campaign... and there was one last conquest to make.  I left it open.  The game's event system has run its course.  There are no further events.  The AIs are going quiescent.  I cannot imagine the setting truly settling that way; it must be released to form new stories.

22:06.  I feel hungerpangs creeping in, controlling my mind.
