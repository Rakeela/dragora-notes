16:40.  I've been sick today, so I haven't been trying to get anything productive done.  Sneezing, coughing.  My nose and throat hurt.  I feel about as good as I have all day and I'm bored with *not* working, so I'm thinking of getting a late start.

17:52.  I still haven't worked on anything.

18:04.  Okay, maybe I'll do some work now.

18:11.  I have more fun working than playing.  I decided I wouldn't work while sick, and I've been so bored.

18:38.  8,310.  I started work this time, but I forgot to record my starting wordcount.

18:56.  8,454.

23:48.  8,857.  547 words of progress.  No, wait.  Error in tally.  8,941.  631 words of progress.

23:54.  4.5 miles.  746 kcal.  15,314 steps.  3 hours, 3 minutes, and 29 seconds.  Average speed 1.5 mph.  Fun fact, I ran it at 1.2 and 2.0 mph, so the 1.5 average shows my ratio between the two speeds!
