10:04.  7,114.

11:54.  8,513.  2,475 words of progress.  I got going well this morning.  I'm going to break for Nationstates.

8.7 miles.  1,590 kcal.  33,002 steps.  7 hours, 20 minutes, and 51 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.  Also wow, I forgot to come back to my writing.  I didn't come back to this window at all.  Focusing on my daylogs helps me get things done.
