20:13.  I have no focus today.  All I have are my ideals.  My longings.  I was completely incapable of getting anything done.  The dentist visit disrupted me beyond reason.  I'm trying to recover now.

20:19.

20:22.  It's such a struggle.  The day is gone.  I still need to shower.

20:43.  Not

20:45.  Working

20:58.  

21:09.  89,350.  I played a game of unusual intensity and horror this morning.  I needed a much stronger distraction than usual.

21:10.  Games apply a kind of narrative corruption to me.  Knight of Talonia was born of that corruption.  It's based on my play of Equestria at War.  Games are such glimpses of horror.  I can't bear them.  I exorcise them with narrative.

21:11.  The horror of that game...  I must record its name...  Broken Dreams Correctional Facility...  I told myself I would not record it.  I told myself I would try to forget.  It is overpowering.  What a nightmare vision!  What a world of misery it opens onto!  I cannot write with that!

21:12.  It was that damned dentist visit.  I wanted to think of something else, quite urgently.  It worked, but I never recovered afterwards.

21:17.  89,350.

21:38.  89,402.  I can't think straight right now.

22:02.  I've got nothing.  I can't think of my story.  I found myself with a headache and a shortness of breath, for which I took ventolin, so I wonder if I have for some time been short of breath.  Still, I feel a thickness of my head, and I can't work productively right now.

22:04.  I am eating a bar of sugarfree white chocolate.
