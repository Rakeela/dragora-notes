I made a GoodReads account today.  It was an event for me to be reminded of past books that I'd read and enjoyed, as well as an opportunity to finally express some of my love for the books that I've been reading lately.  It was a delight to give [[Royal-Red]] a five-star rating.  I feel a little bad for not feeling inspired to write a review for it.  I reviewed it for Amazon.  I need to eventually review it for GoodReads so that more people will be drawn to it.

I haven't eaten anything so far today.  I've fasted before, but I've been dependent on a fasting-tracker app on my phone.  I haven't "tracked" today's fast.  I'm trying to do it for myself without the app.

My longest tracked fast is 8 days.  I have a distinct belief that I've fasted for 13 days at the longest.  That suggests that I've done some untracked fasting in the past, already.  Let's just use the tracked fasting record for now.  If I fast for more than 8 days, I'll consider myself to have broken my record.  I'm not necessarily trying for the record right now.

In theory, I want to weigh 180 pounds.  I've gotten down to 223.3 pounds at my lowest point.  I currently weigh 257.2 pounds.  My highest weight was ~320 pounds.  I've never successfully lost weight by dieting.  I've only successfully lost weight by fasting.  If I'm eating, I'm gaining weight.

There's an existential trust involved in recording one's mind accurately.  I don't have enough of it yet.  There's stuff I'm concealing from this record.  I wonder if I'll get to that level of trust.

Oh my god, what am I thinking, fasting near Halloween?  I should be eating candy!
