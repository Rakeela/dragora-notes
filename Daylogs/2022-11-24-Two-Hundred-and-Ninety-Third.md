I'm so annoyed by the flatulence that I've suffered since stopping sugar-eating.  This constant flatulence makes me want to go buy a cake from the store and eat it.  I think I really might.

5,847 on the file.  Not sure how much longer I'll keep this one before moving on to the next.

6,632 words on the file.  785 words of progress, 882 words to go.  I've been cheerfully distracted this time.

6,804 words on the file.  957 words of progress, 710 words to go.  This has been hard.  I'm kinda bashing my head against this scene.

7,190 words on the file.  1,343 words of progress, 324 words to go.  Now I need to write poetry to advance this scene.  Argh.  (No, I didn't write any poetry.)

7,660 words on the file.  1,813 words of progress, 146 words over quota.

8,107 on the file.  2,260 words of progress, 593 words over quota.

The story is now 52,614 words long.  There are still minor word count anomalies, and I don't understand why... but my software reports that as the overall length.  Subtracting the 4,589 words I started with, I have a present nanowrimo wordcount of 48,025 words.  I should be able to finish up tomorrow, or the day after at the latest.
