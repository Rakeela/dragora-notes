13:50.  8,513.  I wrote a corner in my writing.  That's why I didn't come back to the writing.  I wasn't sure what to write next, and I didn't wrap my brain around the challenge.

15:35.  9,088.

21:26.  12,486.  3,977 words of progress.  It is late and I took risperidone nearly half an hour ago.  I think it is time to stop for the night.  I did not get much written in the last twelve hours, but was stuck observing the gryphon love letter that I had written, making small tweaks to it while appreciating it.

21:31.  12,490.  3,981 words of progress.  I am still stuck rereading what I have written.

21:37.  12,506.  3,993 words of progress.
