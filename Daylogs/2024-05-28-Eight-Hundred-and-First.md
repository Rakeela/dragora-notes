10:32.  I got up two and a half hours ago.  I've been miserable this morning.  I haven't done anything of note.  I browsed the news, listened to music, and did some arguing online.  I guess the arguing online is a public service.  It really does win hearts and minds if done carefully.

10:35.  81,369.

10:54.  81,589.  Sometimes progress is fast, sometimes progress is slow.  Which is this?

17:53.  84,181.  2,812 words of progress.  I feel like my current writing is some of the weakest I've put into this project so far.  I just have to keep going and see if the end product is worthy.

18:12.  84,785.

18:25.  85,152.  There we go.  Questionable scene done.

18:31.  85,336.  Segue into next scene ready.

18:43.  85,317.  Found an error in my wordcount logging.  This revises my estimate downwards.  I won't rebase; I never had this chunk of productivity, it was just an error.

21:48.  86,248.  4,879 words of progress.

21:49.  I think I'm done writing for today.
