15:04.  76,745.

15:59.  76,900.  Today is pretty hard.

17:16.  77,928.  Still not getting my teeth into the essentials of Act Three.

17:30.  78,040.  Solving another problem.  Still figuring out Act Three.

18:11.  78,241.  I discovered an incomplete bit of Act Two.  That was kinda hard to write!  It felt like two hundred and one very slow words.

18:36.  78,519.  1,774 words of progress.

18:39.  78,602.  I didn't write that much in a moment, I just realized that my wordcount tracking missed a chunk.

21:58.  I've been reading a Buddhist text that I'd like to get through.

21:08.  Crap, what hour was the previous timepoint at?  Was that one hour ago or two?  I'd correct it, but I'm not sure what the accurate time would be.  I think that was at 19:58 as most likely...  Anyways...

21:09.  79,143.  2,398 words of progress.
