8:49.  116,538.

11:30.  117,509.

12:04.  117,802.  I've been working steadily, and it's a relief.  Socializing a whole bunch was nice at first, but it got old fast.  I just want to get back to work.

15:43.  I stopped working for a while.  A few hours, I think.  I've been back to working for a bit now, but I'm struggling to think of what happens next in the story.

17:32.  119,075.  2,537 words of progress today.

17:54.  119,376.  

17:59.  I got beset by random sadness as I was writing.

19:10.  120,054.  I pushed through the sadness and kept going.

19:45.  120,360.  3,822 words of progress.

20:20.  120,505.  3,967 words of progress.

20:25.  I'm flagging.
