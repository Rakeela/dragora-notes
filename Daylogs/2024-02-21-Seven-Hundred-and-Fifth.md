7:36.  I ate so poorly yesterday that I damaged my mouth.  A small chunk of flesh came off of the upper right side of my mouth.  It still hurts.

9:17.  I haven't gotten moving yet on my treadmill.  I also haven't eaten anything.

9:24.  Moving on treadmill.

9:29.  I'm a little excited to start on Slantworld for the day.  Maybe 15% excited.  Better than I usually feel about it!

9:44.  57,547.

10:30.  57,996.  Starting on another brick of lentils.

11:42.  I ate a chocolate bar.  I've been hungry this morning, the lentils haven't been lasting.  They're not depleted, but they might not last to 3.

13:29.  59,140.  1,593 words of progress.

13:37.  I'm stalled, and fighting distraction.  1,986 words on the chapter.  I'm thinking of writing this book to 120,000 words instead of my usual 90,000.

13:47.  59,199.  I'm eating a chunk of my reserve chocolate.  The amount of bulk chocolate that I've just given myself is approximately one chocolate bar worth of chocolate.  I planned yesterday to eat a bit of reserve chocolate today.  Let's see if I can do this without binging.

13:50.  The tastiest thing I ate yesterday was the cauliflower mac.  It's not the first time that I've noticed a healthier object is really, actually the most hedonic option.  My consumption of less healthy objects appears to be addictive, not hedonic.  The distinction is lost on some people, but I consider it very important.  Addictions are often not hedonically optimal.

14:04.  Wrong button on the treadmill.  4.1 miles.  769 kcal.  15,831 steps.  3 hours, 33 minutes, and 16 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.

14:54.  59,228.  I am distracted, and making little progress.  I'm sorta in a holding pattern waiting for someone to pay attention to me, because we were considering playing a game together tonight.

14:59.  I don't know what timezone this person is in, but I know that time is really slipping past quickly.

15:03.  For some reason, the idea of using AI for porn hits me like the idea of molesting someone against their will.  I feel like I'd be molesting the AI.  I keep thinking about using AI Dungeon that way, and it's like...  whyyyy does it feel like that.

17:55.  Distracted by thought of food again.

18:31.  59,228.  I got sideswiped for two hours listening to someone talking about their work in someone else's IP and I didn't get any more written during that time.  Now I wonder if I actually will get any more written today.  Ugh.  Would it be too much eating if I ate a bit more reserve chocolate?  I think I'm going to go do that.

22:16.  59,788.  I've been distracted by yet another movie, and then I showered, and then I've just plain been stalled.  2,241 words of progress.  Not impressive for a day, though I've done worse even recently.
