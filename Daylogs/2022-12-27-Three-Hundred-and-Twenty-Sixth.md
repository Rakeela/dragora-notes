Only a few more days of 2022 left.

1)  Vergani Amaretto Nougat.  Soft nougat.  450 calories for the whole bar, which I'm just going to eat in one sitting this time.  This one isn't nearly as good as the cappucino flavor was.  Somehow I think that contributes to my unwillingness to be patient with it.

I'm also eating 600 calories of mukikame with breakfast.  It's vegetable calories, but a substantial amount of them.  I may be setting today up to go high in calorie count.

2) Ritter Sport Marzipan.  Chocolate bar filled with marzipan.  160 calories per 1/4th.  Let's see if that aftertaste is still there...  Hmm, not really.  It didn't bother me this time.  The Niederegger is still better.
3) More Ritter Sport Marzipan.  160 calories.  I can't close this one back up and I kinda want to use it up.  Leaving it open just bothers me.
4) Jell-O Milk Chocolate Pudding Cups.  Chocolate shells filled with chocolate pudding.  160 calories per three pieces.  In today's edition of "foods I will not buy twice", something that I expected to be kinda bad.  It's not disgusting or anything, it's just very second-rate.  The Niagara double-chocolate mint cups are like a much better version of this, as are Lindt truffles.  The serving size is three and I'm not tempted to have more.

I ate a small serving of french fries.  Baked, not fried.  I'm going to estimate it at 220 calories.

I've been drinking the alcoholic eggnog without scoring it in my calorie counts.  It is beyond my usual habits.  I have also no idea how to estimate it.  It hasn't been very good and it hasn't been bad.  It tastes good, but the alcohol in the flavor is a warding flaw rather than a good thing.  It's momentary.  I haven't felt 'high' from it, though I drank enough at one point (yesterday) to get a headache when the effect faded.

5) More Jell-O Milk Chocolate Pudding Cups.  320 calories for the rest of the bag.  Blegh.  I can't reseal this bag either, but maybe I should've thrown out the remainder instead of eating them.
6) More Ritter Sport Marzipan.  160 calories.  I'm chasing bad chocolate with decent chocolate.

Life is kind of about eating to me.  I really enjoy food.  Maybe logging everything I eat could be enjoyable, too.  I get to enjoy the memories of the things that I write down for longer.  Can I extend the longevity of food memories as well?

Broccoli caulflower au gratin for 530 calories.  This is a really surprising microwave dish.  I wonder how I would feel if I ate nothing but this in a day.

I'm considering not eating tomorrow through Sunday.

I ate half a pizza tonight.  I'm not estimating the calorie load from that.  It's high.  It was a thick, deep-dish pizza.

7) Niederegger Milk Chocolate Marzipan.  Chocolate bar filled with marzipan.  200 calories per 1/3rd.  I'm finishing this off.  I don't want this sitting around tempting me if I'm going to stop eating for a few days.
