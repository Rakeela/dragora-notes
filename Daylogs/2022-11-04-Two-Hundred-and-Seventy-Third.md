My writing program reports that I have 10,947 words today.  I'm not sure why there's always a discrepancy.  If I credit the discrepancy to my writing today, I get 133 'free' words.

I'm starting on a file with 1,267 words in it.

Whoops!  I found a continuity error in my writing.  I have to go back to a file with 2,515 words in it.  Aaaaand... now it has 2,588 words.  That's 73 words.

I've gotten stalled at 1,999 words on the file.  That's 732 words.  Added to 133 and 73, that's 938 words.  I need 729 more words to make my daily quota for Nanowrimo.

I'm modifying a previous file, taking it from 3020 words to 3028 words.  That's another 8 to the quota.  I need 721 more words.

I'm chipping away at the word total that I need.  The file that I'm working on has grown to 2280 words.  I feel like there's no finish line in sight, but recalculating again I see that I need 440 more words to finish my daily quota.

383...  152...  -81!  I'm over the quota by 81 words.  The file that I'm working on grew to 2,801 words.
