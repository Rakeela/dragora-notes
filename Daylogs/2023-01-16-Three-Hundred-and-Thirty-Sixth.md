I have found a cheese I cannot eat.  I keep telling myself, "It's not that bad, have another bite!"  And I keep coming away being like, "Bleh!  It is too that bad!"  It's Fromager D'Affinois with Herbs.  I do not like it at all.  It tastes musty.

I am embarking on Cheese Week 2.  This time, I do not plan to take a break from eating cheese at the end of the week.  I am also going to be eating eggs this week.  Eggs induce no insulin response!

If I were an athlete, my optimal diet would be different.  For gaining muscle mass, fat is useless.  Moderate amounts of carbohydrates and large amounts of protein are the dietary target for extreme exercisers.  Gaining muscle mass on a high-fat diet is actually difficult.  But I don't want muscle mass.  I want to lose fat.

I'm writing a new story.  I need to take a little note to myself to help me get the story straight, and maybe publishing this will help me get over my reluctance to put the story onto my regular media.

Sirrae; Lawful Good; Family and Justice
Detar; Lawful Neutral; Battle and Balance
Finir; Lawful Evil; Smoke and Contracts
Tova; Lawful Evil; Knowledge and Death
