9:05.  It was hard to get out of bed this morning due to leg pain.  My left calf hurt especially.  I have no clue why.

9:14.  I made an error in Knight of Talonia, and now I'm reluctant to go back and fix it.  I don't know why the prospect sucks so much.  I am just somehow not ready to face any challenges today.

9:36.  I am so drained.  It seemed like hardly a moment passed since the last timepoint.

10:06.  56,612.

10:14.  56,631.  Kistaro has requested I run an errand, so I will not be working further on this right this moment.

10:51.  55,692.  The writing on a fight has been improved.

11:30.  56,882.  270 words of progress.  Starting in on another scene, but I'm pausing again as a friend has sent me a video to watch.

14:23.  I finished the video and went back to writing, but progress has continued to be achingly slow.  57,683.  Wait, that's not terrible.  Hm.  Or maybe it is.  I'm not sure.  1,071 words of progress.  Ah.  Yes, it's terrible.

16:02.  58,972.  2,360 words of progress.  393 words an hour.

17:06.  59,036.  Grrrrrrr.  Progress is so slow today.  I'm going to stop and play Nationstates a little bit.

17:49.  59,363.  I played a little bit of Nationstates, went back to work.  Still difficult to make headway.

20:37.  60,533.  3,921 words of progress.

20:39.  That's the limit of my current story planning.  I had a few planned scenes and they were difficult for me.
