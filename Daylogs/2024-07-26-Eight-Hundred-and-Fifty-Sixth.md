10:29.  Yesterday I spent hours failing to boot.  I was acting repetitiously and failing to get anywhere in any task.  I eventually organized a bonus roleplaying session with my TTRPG group, which was a lot of fun and very relaxing, but not any more productive in my projects.  The lack of work yesterday is why I didn't take a daylog.

10:31.  Yesterday's exercise.  8.0 miles.  1,391 kcal.  29,010 steps.  6 hours, 9 minutes, and 6 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.

(This part added the next day.)  11.1 miles.  1,849 kcal.  38,936 steps.  7 hours, 45 minutes, and 4 seconds.  Average speed 1.4 mph.  I feel like I should stop recording the kcals.  It's not a meaningful measure.  The amount of calories burned while exercising is just bogus.
