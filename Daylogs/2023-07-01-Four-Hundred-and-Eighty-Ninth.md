11:01.  Ugh.  I'm having trouble launching this morning.  Why are my mornings so hard?

11:05.  I feel comforted by my favorite sweater, but I'm not really cold enough to wear it.

11:58.  Oops.  I started to work earlier, around the 11:05 mark, but I forgot to record my starting word count.  Yesterday's concluding word count was 42,432.  My current word count is 42,725.

15:40.  43,227.  795 words of progress.  I've been at my computer all day, but I've mostly been watching Pixar movies instead of writing.

19:16.  43,430.  998 words of progress.

20:03.  43,840.  1,408 words of progress.  That is quota, and I have written enough today.  This has been hard.  I may come back.  When I 'let' myself depart from writing, sometimes I cannot stop thinking about it, and I come back with new ideas.

20:09.  I've eaten two packets of ramen today, and it seems to be the case that I don't get that neurotic hunger after eating ramen.

21:44.  Ugh, no.  No coming back to the writing tonight.  1,408 is all I get done today.
