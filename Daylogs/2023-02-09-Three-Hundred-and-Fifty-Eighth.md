Morning weigh-in:  249.4 pounds.

I've already eaten a few things.  Boston cream handpie and some "steak and onion" flavour potato chips.  Mm!  Okay, I've just added a Reese's mallowtop to the damages.  I'm cheating rampantly, though if I eat no more, I'll have eaten no more than I intended to eat today.

Not counting the omelette tonight.  I definitely plan to eat one of those.  Eggs are "free"!

I accidentally double-clicked on the treadmill's pause button, so here's the summary from session one.  I walked 17,280 steps, crossing 6.0 miles, burning an estimated 879 kcal, and going at a summary-pace of 1.9 mph (I had it set at 2.0 speed) over 3 hours, 4 minutes, and 5 seconds.

To get to 1,520 kcal burned, I'd have to walk for another 641 kcal.  To get to 30,000 steps, I'd have to take another 12,720 steps.

70,810 words on the file.  1,532 words of progress.  Not bad.

71,478 words on the file.  2,200 words of progress.  Even better.  Except I discovered an error and I'll have to rewrite everything I wrote today to fix it.  It'll be faster the second time.  I can reuse MOST of the content.

Stopping exercise for the evening.  I walked another 13,207 steps, crossing 4.6 miles, burning an estimated 683 kcal, and going at a summary-pace of 1.9 mph over 2 hours, 22 minutes, and 50 seconds.

That's a total distance today of 10.6 miles and a total kcal burn estimate of 1,562.
