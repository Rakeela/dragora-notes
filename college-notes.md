# college notes

I was thinking about uploading my class notes here.  I don't actually /take/ class notes, historically; I've always relied on my native ability to absorb texts and the potential causal structures that they suggest.  So I'm not sure I'll do this in both a social sense and in a more fundamental one, which is that it'd be something new.
