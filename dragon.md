# Dragon

Rawr.  I am an [[otherkin]] dragon.  I am terribly unhappy with [[being human]].

I think I could write forever about dragons.  It's not a spiritual affinity for me, it's a thwarted biological affinity.  I don't care about the symbol.  I care about the body.  I'm supposed to have earfins; little muscled spars on each side of my face with wrinkly flaps between them, that rise, fall, or turn with my attention.  I'm supposed to have a tail; a flexible muscled limb for signalling.  I should have hindquarters capable of launching me into the air, and wings capable of catching me there... although I don't really mind the lack of wings as much as the lack of other things.  I even ought to have pheromones, and I don't mean anything so mind-controlling as humans portray them in fiction.

When I say this is biological, some of it is prurient.  Human leg structure is wrong.  Earfins are sexually sensitive in intimate contexts.  I don't know how to be attracted to someone without a tail.  To the extent that human bodies react in scent, human noses can't detect it.  I am incredibly disappointed with human sexuality.
