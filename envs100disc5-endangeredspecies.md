# Envs100disc5 EndangeredSpecies

The teacher's error in setting up this post really makes me sic, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't do it.

Task instructions:  Pick an organism considered endangered in the US to discuss.  Tell us why it is endangered, and what is being done to protect the organism.  What are the human and economic impacts of trying to protect the organism?

I wonder if I can find any endangered organisms with unusual biochemistry whose protection therefore might have long-term implications on human medical potentials.  I see that as the purest example of ecological conservation's potential benefits.  I confess that if we'd solved every question in biology, I would be of the opinion that no species is endangered if another species looks kinda like it.

Yeah, this is not catching my imagination *at all*.  I don't want to let it down, but I'm having trouble thinking about where to begin.  I'm mostly writing this as a kind of free-association exercise thinking that writing anything at all would be more productive than writing nothing at all.

The Mariana Crow (*Corvus kubaryi*) may be the most intelligent creature on the endangered species list.  A small crow found only on Rota, which is a single island north of Guam, they have bluish-black gloss on their back, wings, and tail, and greenish-black gloss on their heads and underside.  Hunting by the brown catsnake, an invasive predator accidentally introduced to the area shortly after World War II, has destroyed the nests of this crow.  Locals who see the crow as a worthless barrier to development have been hurrying this process along by hunting them.    Humanity would stop such a practice if it were targeted against other humans, but when it is merely directed against 'possible sapients' like crows there's a great deal more handwringing and nothing to be done.  The loss of the Mariana Crow would cost the region of Micronesia its only endemic corvid.

This is part of the basic difficulty with environmentalism.  The popularity of it is among populations that are already well-developed.  When people's needs are well met in kind environs, they develop in that kindness and have a willingness to extend their concerns more readily.  The story of environmentalism is then like the story of Buddha, who was first SidhhƒÅrtha Gautama, a prince raised in opulence.  Venturing forth from his enclosed paradise to view the outer world for the first time, he discovered that his life without suffering was atypical, and the conditions of the public bothered him quite greatly.  His renunciation of luxury is of course legendary, but what I want to focus on is that he grew kind in an era when conditions were such that most of humanity grew cruel.  This I think is the general tragedy of humanity's relationship with environmentalism, that development necessarily precedes it, and only when resources are abundant do people begin to turn those resources towards preserving that which resembles only wastage and poverty to people with fewer resources.  Those who could stand in poverty and agree that killing a Mariana Crow would be murder are few and pure indeed.

Ecologists are aware of the plight of the Mariana Crow.  There was a breeding population for some time on Guam due to attempts by ecologists to introduce the crow to a new island with an amenable habitat.  This specifically was what failed due to the brown catsnake, though brown catsnakes have been spotted on Rota as well, leading to concerns over the survival of the species.  Efforts are underway to remove non-native predators from the area in an effort to save the last 60 breeding pairs of Mariana Crows.  Surveillance of predators on the island and video cameras on crow nests have been brought together in order to prevent predation on the crows and determine their fate.  I hope it works, though I'm concerned it might not.  For that matter, I'm concerned that bright orange tracking bands may be an unhealthy addition to a black-feathered bird.  I don't know what strategies crows use to hide, but I suspect their instincts are well-tuned for being very dark birds.
