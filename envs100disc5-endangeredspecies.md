# Envs100disc5 EndangeredSpecies

The teacher's error in setting up this post really makes me sic, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't do it.

Task instructions:  Pick an organism considered endangered in the US to discuss.  Tell us why it is endangered, and what is being done to protect the organism.  What are the human and economic impacts of trying to protect the organism?

I wonder if I can find any endangered organisms with unusual biochemistry whose protection therefore might have long-term implications on human medical potentials.  I see that as the purest example of ecological conservation's potential benefits.  I confess that if we'd solved every question in biology, I would be of the opinion that no species is endangered if another species looks kinda like it.
