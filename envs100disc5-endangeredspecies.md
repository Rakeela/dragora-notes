# Envs100disc5 EndangeredSpecies

The teacher's error in setting up this post really makes me sic, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't do it.

Task instructions:  Pick an organism considered endangered in the US to discuss.  Tell us why it is endangered, and what is being done to protect the organism.  What are the human and economic impacts of trying to protect the organism?

I wonder if I can find any endangered organisms with unusual biochemistry whose protection therefore might have long-term implications on human medical potentials.  I see that as the purest example of ecological conservation's potential benefits.  I confess that if we'd solved every question in biology, I would be of the opinion that no species is endangered if another species looks kinda like it.

Yeah, this is not catching my imagination *at all*.  I don't want to let it down, but I'm having trouble thinking about where to begin.  I'm mostly writing this as a kind of free-association exercise thinking that writing anything at all would be more productive than writing nothing at all.

The Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi) may be the most intelligent creature on the endangered species list.  A small crow found only on Rota, which is a single island north of Guam, they have bluish-black gloss on their back, wings, and tail, and greenish-black gloss on their heads and underside.  Hunting by the brown catsnake, an invasive predator accidentally introduced to the area shortly after World War II, has destroyed the nests of this crow.  Locals who see the crow as a worthless barrier to development have been hurrying this process along by hunting them.    Humanity would stop such a practice if it were targeted against other humans, but when it is merely directed against 'possible sapients' like crows there's a great deal more handwringing and nothing to be done.
