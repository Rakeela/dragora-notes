My new biology teacher *drips* hostility the way only people who are *never* hostile are capable of it.  She comes off like an over-the-top dishonest person!  I'm very disappointed.  I don't look forward to being "not"-attacked by another deceptive person.  Authoritarians suck!  People need to be more polite; they need to respect the right of others to have their own thoughts.

This is the first teacher I've had at my current institution who seemed to fail on that count.  I want to say I've never met someone who could seethe with a thank you, but I have.  Such a distaste for consensual interactions is literally obligatory in some environments, and if I interpreted her comments correctly, she was rebuking me for failling to conform with obligatory social opacity, then icily hating me for rebuking her openly for having been dishonest to a student.  I don't regret that; it is no less than required by etiquette.

I wish our society had taught politeness more in recent years, so that people were capable of accepting each other fluidly and without stress, rather than biting at anyone who dares think too much!  Especially in university, it is necessary that people be permitted to think and plan openly without hostile repercussion.  Unfortunately, it seems like rude people try to infiltrate the instruction of etiquette, remaking it into something hateful and restrictive which degrades the honesty in society.  Politeness should open society and make it safer for people to be themselves!  Openness + compassion = politeness!

Well, I don't intend to let it degrade my coursework.  I'll just be on guard.

I'm very disappointed by my global health textbook.  I got a quiz question wrong already due to bad information organization in the book.  Twice in the book, one of the wrong answers from the quiz was presented in the context that the quiz asked about, whereas the right answer was not listed in that context.  This frustrated me most of all because I *did* get the right answer on my *first* pass through the quiz.  I understood the concept, but I tried to answer per the book rather than thinking I knew better than my course material, and I therefore got it wrong!

Reducing tobacco smoking is a more intersectoral issue in global health than improving maternal care.  I knew it before I looked at the book, but I got it marked wrong by trying to answer per the book rather than per my own understanding.

I mean, it'd be arrogant to think I knew better than the course material I was studying, right?  I'm in class to correct my presumably flawed prior understandings, so it's appalling to get penalized for preferring the material to my own understanding.

I kind of resent having to 'interpret' comments, generally.  Why don't people respect the emotional safety of others enough to be straightforward?

I want to say, like, were they never a child scared by unclear feedback from an authority figure?  That teacher sent me a questioning email, and included an anomalous comment... and I can just tell that for trying to engage as required by etiquette, I'm in danger of being hated, because an authority figure approached me with ambiguous comments from a position of control.  The hatred of others is not my hatred.  If we had a more polite society, this kind of thing wouldn't happen, but rude people hate the open societies, preferring their closed hostilities where people are at risk if they're caught thinking about any other world but the one to which they're supposed to be conforming.

The smallpox eradication story makes the global reaction to Coronavirus look unconsciably corrupted.

In the 70s, it was possible for the USA to engage in door-to-door medical care across ALL OF INDIA, a larger and less friendly territory than its own, with considerably less development.  It should therefore be possible to conduct door-to-door medical care across all of the USA, which is a smaller target with better services and a general assurance of safety for the field teams.  Door-to-door medical distribution would drastically accelerate the curing of the coronavirus.

This makes a complete mockery of the expense of healthcare.  It was in the 70s cost-effective for the USA to eradicate a disease ABROAD.  Yet today we can't eradicate a disease that is supposedly wrecking the global economy?  This speaks of extraordinary falsehood and suggests that if we installed a Glasswall, we would learn a great many unusual things about our political leaders.

The same people who castigated me for doing nothing always refused to provide assistance or make resources available for things to be done.  I think they were projecting.  I think they were trying to do nothing and they were scapegoating me for it.  I was willing to do other things, but the only thing they would actually *cooperate* with was sex.  *Everything* else was "too expensive", such that I have consistently gotten the impression that our society is *massively impoverished*.

I don't think our society is massively impoverished.  I think that humanity really is at apex wealth.  I think our society is just corrupted and hateful, entrenching dishonest people at the expense of everyone else.  We'd be better off with a sortition system.  It would put "stupid" and "incompetent" people into power... and, failing to know that doing literally anything is too expensive, those stupid and incompetent people would proceed to get stuff done.

On the cheap, judging by the smallpox campaign!  Our ancestors were stupider, sicker, and more mentally ill than us!  They didn't know what they couldn't do, and so they did tons of stuff that we of today's world "know" is impossible.

I mean, that's why I don't have a lab.  That's why I believed that transhumanism needed sex workers more than it needed research assistants.  In order to be very trusting of people, I had to believe that society had grown massively impoverished, and couldn't afford to do anything with a pricetag higher than a thousand bucks.  That's just not true.  It never was, and it was an injustice that I was held accountable as though only paradise has ever had resources.

Our ancestors were dirt poor, too.  They had dramatically *less* than we had.  Why can't we do more with more?

If the problem is that everyone's exhausted, literally, if that's just widespread and people had all the can-do victimized out of them the way I just about had it victimized out of me...  For one thing, why don't we get nicer?  Why give up all our progress because we're obsessively mean for no particular reason?  This is a tangent; it side-swiped my thinking here.  Mean people telling me that literally everything was too expensive and pushing me towards sex ruined my life.  Sex is cheap, but it doesn't get anything *done*.  I didn't like it, and my complaints were treated as lies versus the obvious true reality that I was worthless and incapable of doing anything.  That behavior was a misery-inducing waste of human potential that even made the people *doing* it miserable.

The original thought I was going to get at before that tangent distracted me is this, which is more central and critical: why not embrace transhumanism?  Liberal transhumanism should always have been a highly effective countermeasure here if the problem is some kind of mass public exhaustion.  If your hand offends you, cut it off!  More to the point, implant chemical regulators into people so that their metabolism stays tuned for high performance during the day, and mental recovery across the evening and night.  Running the body harder is basically entropic, but if we're failing our medical potential by mass exhaustion, high-tech hummingbird implants could actually make people live longer.

This is the kind of product I dreamed of selling from Otter Labs when I was younger.  I wanted to found a company to commercialize that.

Or hell, speaking of cybernetics, try embracing cybernetics in the old Russian sense.  Set up complex cybernetic programming scenarios, expose them to the public, and hold prize contests for the best solutions.  If we're specifically bankrupt on the logistical skills needed to organize big interventions, *target the development of that skill*.  As meta-technological insights go, this one isn't even especially advanced.

I wanted to found a company dealing with real issues and "omniscience" treated me as wanting nothing but sex!  I wasn't willing to reproduce!  Nobody convinced me it was a good idea!  All of my dreams were derided by people who then became infuriated at my "lies" for sexually rejecting them and my "primitive" inactivation!

They were right to imagine me as enraged, but the part I don't understand is why they didn't understand that there might be some rational cause for the emotion they imagined.  I was dealing with people who were very, very proud that they knew more about the world than I did, and who were very proud of the power they had over me by being dishonest to me.
