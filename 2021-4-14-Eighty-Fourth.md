My new biology teacher *drips* hostility the way only people who are *never* hostile are capable of it.  She comes off like an over-the-top dishonest person!  I'm very disappointed.  I don't look forward to being "not"-attacked by another deceptive person.  Authoritarians suck!  People need to be more polite; they need to respect the right of others to have their own thoughts.

This is the first teacher I've had at my current institution who seemed to fail on that count.  I want to say I've never met someone who could seethe with a thank you, but I have.  Such a distaste for consensual interactions is literally obligatory in some environments, and if I interpreted her comments correctly, she was rebuking me for failling to conform with obligatory social opacity, then icily hating me for rebuking her openly for having been dishonest to a student.  I don't regret that; it is no less than required by etiquette.

I wish our society had taught politeness more in recent years, so that people were capable of accepting each other fluidly and without stress, rather than biting at anyone who dares think too much!  Especially in university, it is necessary that people be permitted to think and plan openly without hostile repercussion.  Unfortunately, it seems like rude people try to infiltrate the instruction of etiquette, remaking it into something hateful and restrictive which degrades the honesty in society.  Politeness should open society and make it safer for people to be themselves!  Openness + compassion = politeness!

Well, I don't intend to let it degrade my coursework.  I'll just be on guard.

I'm very disappointed by my global health textbook.  I got a quiz question wrong already due to bad information organization in the book.  Twice in the book, one of the wrong answers from the quiz was presented in the context that the quiz asked about, whereas the right answer was not listed in that context.  This frustrated me most of all because I *did* get the right answer on my *first* pass through the quiz.  I understood the concept, but I tried to answer per the book rather than thinking I knew better than my course material, and I therefore got it wrong!

Reducing tobacco smoking is a more intersectoral issue in global health than improving maternal care.  I knew it before I looked at the book, but I got it marked wrong by trying to answer per the book rather than per my own understanding.

I mean, it'd be arrogant to think I knew better than the course material I was studying, right?  I'm in class to correct my presumably flawed prior understandings, so it's appalling to get penalized for preferring the material to my own understanding.
