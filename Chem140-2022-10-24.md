Molecular shapes
AXE format
A = Central Atom
X = Surrounding Atom
E = Lone pair on central atom

X-A-X
X=A=X  AX2E0 (X subscript 2 E subscript 0)
X-A---Y (triple bond) AXYE0

AX2E0: Two electron groups, no lone pairs.  Linear molecular shape.
AX3E0: Three electron groups, no lone pairs.  Trigonal planar molecular shape.
AX2E1: Three electron groups, one lone pair.  Bent molecular shape.
AX2E2: Four electron groups, two lone pairs.  Bent molecular shape.
AX3E1: Four electron groups, one lone pair.  Trigonal pyramidal shape.
AX4E0: Four electron groups, no lone pairs.  Tetrahedral molecular shape.

We're being given periodic tables and sheets of conversions for the exam, but we're supposed to memorize the elements by their symbols.  The teacher mentioned that the first thirty six elements are a good objective to memorize.

Mole - a very large amount

Defined in two ways
1) in terms of mass
2) In terms of number, Constant number = 6.022x10^23 items (Avogadro's Number, or N-subscript-A; I can't subscript, so I'm just going to call it NA in notes here.)
Items for moles can be atoms, molecules, or formula units

The so-called chemist's superdozen.  As a dozen contains twelve items, a mole contains 6.022x10^23 items. 

In terms of mass
N element = 14.01 amu  (1 amu = 1.66x10^-24 g)
1 mol N = 14.01 g N
N2 molecule = 2x14.01 = 28.02 amu
1 mol N2 = 28.02 g N2
1 mol H2O = 2x1.008+16.00 = 2.016+16.00 = 18.016 ~= 18.02 g H2O

gA --> molA
