I'm bored.  My manuscript writing stalled after I hit quota today, so I've been spinning my wheels thinking it's okay to stop writing, but I need something else to do.  And yet I can't think of anything I *want* to do.  Besides eat.

I've been sleeping too much lately.  All the stuff I want to do is either sleeping, eating, or working.  Yet I only work a few hours a day, and I'm trying not to turn blimpy, and it isn't healthy to oversleep.  I can't work more, I stall out.

So I spend hours stalled out.  I don't know what to do about being bored.

I've been a bit horny, but my libido is so tainted right now.  I have trouble imaging myself wanting sex with anyone, so all I get are rape scenarios.  I've been wondering if I should write something up based on rape scenarios.  Then I'd have a second manuscript to work on when the first one stalled out.  That would let me work for more hours every day, displacing hours spent sleeping, eating, or being stalled out.

How do I make a whole manuscript out of...

Well, I've been thinking about a concept where men are *so rare* that they've valued as breeding rapebait.  One woman can only be impregnated once at a time.  One man can impregnate many women.  If men are *so rare* that they're valued as breeding rapebait, you'd get conspiracies of women holding on to specific individual men.  If you ditch on the idea of this being a harem fantasy and fixate hard on the loss of individual freedom...

I think I'm still working through the trauma that no man is *allowed* to have, even though it happened to me, which is that I was only valued for sex for years, and I was supposed to always be interested in reproduction.

I have weird mixed feelings about Jacel.  I miss Jacel, but I shouldn't.  Jacel believed I was always a pregnophile.  That was awful to me.

I need to come up with more writing ideas.  My current manuscript is horribly near to being complete.  I need another one, even though I still need to work on finishing this one.  I need to find it in myself to have a manuscript I'm writing and a manuscript that I'm polishing.

Writing a story set in a world where a tiny minority of men are stuck being sex slaves is probably *not* what I should use for 'the other manuscript, but it's all I can think about so far tonight.

I keep caffeinating myself hoping that the caffeine will bring other inspiration to the surface...

I'm eating a bowl of corn mixed with peanut butter and strawberry preserves.  It's a peanut butter jelly sandwich, kind of.  It works.
