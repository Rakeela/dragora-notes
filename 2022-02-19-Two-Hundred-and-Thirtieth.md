I'm bored.  My manuscript writing stalled after I hit quota today, so I've been spinning my wheels thinking it's okay to stop writing, but I need something else to do.  And yet I can't think of anything I *want* to do.  Besides eat.

I've been sleeping too much lately.  All the stuff I want to do is either sleeping, eating, or working.  Yet I only work a few hours a day, and I'm trying not to turn blimpy, and it isn't healthy to oversleep.  I can't work more, I stall out.

So I spend hours stalled out.  I don't know what to do about being bored.

I've been a bit horny, but my libido is so tainted right now.  I have trouble imaging myself wanting sex with anyone, so all I get are rape scenarios.  I've been wondering if I should write something up based on rape scenarios.  Then I'd have a second manuscript to work on when the first one stalled out.  That would let me work for more hours every day, displacing hours spent sleeping, eating, or being stalled out.

How do I make a whole manuscript out of...

Well, I've been thinking about a concept where men are *so rare* that they've valued as breeding rapebait.  One woman can only be impregnated once at a time.  One man can impregnate many women.  If men are *so rare* that they're valued as breeding rapebait, you'd get conspiracies of women holding on to specific individual men.  If you ditch on the idea of this being a harem fantasy and fixate hard on the loss of individual freedom...

I think I'm still working through the trauma that no man is *allowed* to have, even though it happened to me, which is that I was only valued for sex for years, and I was supposed to always be interested in reproduction.

I have weird mixed feelings about Jacel.  I miss Jacel, but I shouldn't.  Jacel believed I was always a pregnophile.  That was awful to me.

I need to come up with more writing ideas.  My current manuscript is horribly near to being complete.  I need another one, even though I still need to work on finishing this one.  I need to find it in myself to have a manuscript I'm writing and a manuscript that I'm polishing.

Writing a story set in a world where a tiny minority of men are stuck being sex slaves is probably *not* what I should use for 'the other manuscript, but it's all I can think about so far tonight.

I keep caffeinating myself hoping that the caffeine will bring other inspiration to the surface...

I'm eating a bowl of corn mixed with peanut butter and strawberry preserves.  It's a peanut butter jelly sandwich, kind of.  It works.

I just can't imagine wanting sex, and I'm not allowed to be who I was: someone who was only valued sexually.  That's why I'm fixated on a world where someone who doesn't want sex is only valued sexually.  I want to use what I went through in my art.  It was years of hell to go through and it's hell to think about writing, too.

I do and do not want to write a story about someone forced into aphrodisiac addiction to serve the sexual needs of people who think that the aphrodisiac addict is just a mindless slut who ought to be happy with it.  I'm fixated on it because men are supposed to only want sex.  Being sexually valued is supposed to be *apex masculine experience*, and it's like...  Oh my god, if men were *only valued sexually* they would hate it SO. VERY. MUCH.  I want to write something that makes people who read it understand that treating being valued sexually as *apex masculine experience* is actually misandristic.

We understand in society that treating being sexually valued as *apex feminine experience* is misogynistic, AND IT IS.  We don't understand in society that treating being sexually valued as *apex masculine experience* is misandristic, BUT IT IS TOO.  What's misogynistic against women is still misandristic against men when reversed.
