I have a bunch of candy from the post-Valentines sale.  I almost missed it this year, with all the fasting I've been doing; IMO, it's the real holiday.  I'll be interested in celebrating Valentines Day itself when I've got a dragon's body to do it with, rawr!

...I've been lately realizing that my most central romantic complaint with Earth society really is "I don't want to kiss humans," and there's nothing that more exactly summarizes my erotic disinterest in humanity.  I want to kiss dragons, not humans!

Anyways, candy.  I've got a velvet-topped box of "red velvet" chocolates that are quite interesting.  They're tasty, although I'm not sure they taste like red velvet cake (as they're supposed to).  They're disappointing.  I was expecting chocolate covered cake, or at least something akin to red velvet brownie pieces enrobed in chocolate.  They're kind of more filled with red velvet slime.

I'm mentioning them because their texture is inconsistent in a way that points to a better potential.  The best chocolates in the box aren't disappointing at all.  They have sugar crystals in their filling, which gives it texture and greatly improves its mouth-feel.  Their flavor is better, too.  My husband suspects that those are factory defects, and that the "red velvet" filling is supposed to be smooth (as it is for most of the chocolates in the box).  I believe he's right, but I wish the whole box had been made with little sugar crystals gleaming in the filling.

I think the argument against the ethics of reproduction may be wholly general and applicable to all cases.  For the basic problem is that the target of reproduction (the new individual) *cannot* have consented to exist...  Even in a hypothetical perfect environment (such as reproduction within [[Yggdrasil]]), there is no guarantee that all possible individuals are 'satiable' (sorry, this is an imperfect word here), and thus there is no guarantee that reproduction is not a violation of the consent of at least one involved party.  Furthermore, to bring someone into Yggdrasil who will *suffer* there in the highest possible society sounds like a horrible fracture in the potential of our universe.  For in that case, there is truly nowhere else to go, and all that they can do is wander forlorn through the many worlds.

For the record, I consider [[character-gallery.md|Yoet]] to have experienced positive utility returns; she does not hate life, and her dissatisfaction is not terminal.  She's fictional, so that doesn't have real ethical value, but it does speak to what I consider the basic resilience of Yggdrasil.  Yoet is an example of a sour edge of Yggdrasil, but not an example of Yggdrasil breaking down.
