I have a bunch of candy from the post-Valentines sale.  I almost missed it this year, with all the fasting I've been doing; IMO, it's the real holiday.  I'll be interested in celebrating Valentines Day itself when I've got a dragon's body to do it with, rawr!

...I've been lately realizing that my most central romantic complaint with Earth society really is "I don't want to kiss humans," and there's nothing that more exactly summarizes my erotic disinterest in humanity.  I want to kiss dragons, not humans!

Anyways, candy.  I've got a velvet-topped box of "red velvet" chocolates that are quite interesting.  They're tasty, although I'm not sure they taste like red velvet cake (as they're supposed to).  They're disappointing.  I was expecting chocolate covered cake, or at least something akin to red velvet brownie pieces enrobed in chocolate.  They're kind of more filled with red velvet slime.

I'm mentioning them because their texture is inconsistent in a way that points to a better potential.  The best chocolates in the box aren't disappointing at all.  They have sugar crystals in their filling, which gives it texture and greatly improves its mouth-feel.  Their flavor is better, too.  My husband suspects that those are factory defects, and that the "red velvet" filling is supposed to be smooth (as it is for most of the chocolates in the box).  I believe he's right, but I wish the whole box had been made with little sugar crystals gleaming in the filling.
