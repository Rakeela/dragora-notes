#2021-11-2-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-First

I've been doling out Huel to myself with a shotglass.  This is the best way to use this stuff up.  I don't fast for purity.  I fast for health.  I consider four hundred calories within that realm... and I've been surprised how far Huel goes in that role.  I've ordered more of the peanut butter Huel (it's the tastiest) and a few others.  This is the greatest threat to my fasting plan: the unexpected durability of a prepared Huel beverage that I can drink by the shot.  Yet if I only drink one per day...  I still consider it a fast.

My naked weight came up 221.5*, but the time is currently coming up on 1 AM.  I'll be posting a lot of those this week, and I'll drink a lot of fluids to try to stop water weight from misleading the number.

*Edit note*:  This was originally posted as 221.6, but that was a typo.  It had actually read 221.5 at the time.

I went out trash-picking again this morning.  I got two plastic bags from Safeway, at which time I also purchased another candy item:
1. Sun-Maid Bites PB&J

That's going in my candy stash.

Later on, when I was dumping off the two full plastic bags of trash at the Fred Meier, I bought and drank Rockstar XDurance Cotton Candy.  (It contains ten calories.)

I'm going to track this stuff all week.  I doubt I'll keep going farther on, as this all feels quite ridiculous, but for now...  another naked weight measure.  People who read this might get to watch my weight inexplicably rise if my water weight has gone up, but indeed I haven't eaten anything.

Current weight as of 12:15 PM:  221.0 pounds.

Okay, so half a pound down.  Staying well-hydrated throughout the day means this shouldn't even be water weight variation.  Nice.

After another round of trash-picking, I found another grocery store that I hadn't visited, and they still had some candy left from Halloween.  I purchased a few more items:
1. Marshmallow "Pumpkin" Peeps
2. Bag of Hershey's Cookies & Cream Snack Size
3. Russel Stover Marshmallow "Pumpkins"
4. Candy Skulls
5. Pop-tarts Bites Frosted "Kooky" Chocolate Fudge

I was surprised to find more.  This should be the last of the candy haul.

I took another weight point at 11 PM.  I came up 220.5 pounds this time!  That seems unnaturally regular.  I'm well-hydrated, so that shouldn't be how it works.

I love candy.  I want free candy forever...  without the weight gain implications, tch.  I want to someday have a virtual candy bowl as my preferred stimulation.  I'll do other stuff while simulating candy consumption.  That's what I want if I can ever be an upload consciousness.  I hope civil rights can be strengthened along the way so that people are never uploaded involuntarily.
