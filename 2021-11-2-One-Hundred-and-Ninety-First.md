#2021-11-2-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-First

I've been doling out Huel to myself with a shotglass.  This is the best way to use this stuff up.  I don't fast for purity.  I fast for health.  I consider four hundred calories within that realm... and I've been surprised how far Huel goes in that role.  I've ordered more of the peanut butter Huel (it's the tastiest) and a few others.  This is the greatest threat to my fasting plan: the unexpected durability of a prepared Huel beverage that I can drink by the shot.  Yet if I only drink one per day...  I still consider it a fast.

My naked weight came up 221.6, but the time is currently coming up on 1 AM.  I'll be posting a lot of those this week, and I'll drink a lot of fluids to try to stop water weight from misleading the number.
