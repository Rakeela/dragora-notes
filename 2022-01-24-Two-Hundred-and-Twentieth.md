While struggling with a frustrating position in Stellaris, I found myself drawn to try developing something based on Idea #12 from my VIdeogame Wishlist.  Based on.  Not exactly the same as.

Imagine a strategy game where there are Fronts of Development, but no tiles or provinces.  Just fronts.  The whole probing warfront is abstracted away and the two armies have instead a Claim Percentage that represents how well-developed their warfront is.  Each unit collective exerts some amount of Claim Percentage depending on what kind of unit it is.

I was thinking that asymmetrical conflicts could be well-represented by this model.  Guerilla units are fragile, but they exert high levels of claim percentage, so that it's difficult for an opposing army to achieve a high level of control across the Front.

I also got distracted imagining a tribal conflict model based on this.  Imagine two tribes in long-term contention for a region.  That's the Front of Development.  Neither tribe starts with a military, but at first they just have Gatherers (civilians) and Hunters (mostly-civilian warriors).  Over time, they develop lots of new specialties with their "technology" treated very directly based on what specialties they develop.

I want to implement something like this!  But I'm so ridiculously inhibited.  My mind is so weak in this endeavor.

I want to make a toy!  Why can't I make even the most basic of software toys based on my ideas?

I worked at it a little bit more, and indeed I cannot make even a basic software toy.
