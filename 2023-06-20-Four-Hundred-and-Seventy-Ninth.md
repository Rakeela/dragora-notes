14:00.  The first thing I saw upon waking up this morning as 12:19 on my watch.  I had slept in late.  That hardly happens anymore.

15:00.  Ugh.  The three o'clock alarm just went off and I haven't done any writing.  Today is unreal.  I hate waking up this late.

15:39.  13,547 words on the file.

16:30.  13,977.

17:47.  14,512.  965 words of progress.  Ugh.  I am writing today because I feel obligated to do so.  I do not want to be writing.

18:21.  14,583.  1,036 words of progress.

19:48.  14,583.  Grr.  I feel like I don't have anything else to say.

20:00.  14,657.  1,110 words of progress.

20:03.  2,756 words on the chapter.   Hm.  This chapter has gone on a while.  It's not super-long yet, but it's not super-short anymore.

20:41.  14,928.  1,381 words of progress.  So close.

21:13.  14,965.  1,418 words of progress.  I FINISHED IT!  BUT I CAN'T CLOSE THIS CHAPTER!  It went somewhere cool and I don't know how to pay off the scene!

23:03.  15,107.  1,560 words of progress.

23:05.  15,112.  1,565 words of progress.  Given the hour, I think I'm done for the night.  I want to wake up on time tomorrow...
