Temperature conversions, intensive and extensive properties.

Heat:
1) Heat is a measure of thermal energy.
2) Heat flows to cold.
3) Heat depends on total number of particles or the size of the sample.  Any property that depends on the size of the sample is called an extensive or extrinsic property.
4) Heat depends on how fast the particles move, or kinetic energy (KE).  Kinetic means motion.  Heat is a measure of total KE.

Temperature (T)
1) Temperature is a measure of thermal energy.
2) Temperature depends on how fast particles move.
3) Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy.  Temperature is a measure of average KE.
4) Temperature does not depend on total number of particles or size of sample.  Any property that does not depend on the size of the sample is called an intensive or intrinsic property.

Comparison example:  A tiny pot of water will cool faster than a large pot of water, because the tiny pot has a lower heat content.

Other examples of intensive properties: density, boiling point, melting point.

I think there's a lot of stuff here that I already know, but I'm obligated to sit through the class and prove it on tests.

The boiling point of water in Fahrenheit is 212 degrees.  The freezing point of water in Fahrenheit is 32 degrees.  In Celsius, the boiling point is 100 degrees, while the freezing point is 0 degrees.  1 degree rise in Celsius is equal to 1.8 degrees rise in Fahrenheit.

The boiling point of water in Kelvin is 373 Kelvin, while the freezing point of water is 273 Kelvin.  There is no negative temperature in kelvin, whose lowest possible temperature is zero Kelvin.  All motion stops at 0 Kelvin, where all kinetic energy is removed, and this temperature is called absolute zero.  It is not possible to achieve under ordinary conditions.  Just as in celsius, 100 degrees of Kelvin separates the freezing and boiling point of water, so that any 1 degree of celsius rise is equal to a 1 degree rise of Kelvin.

K = TC + 273; TK - 273 = TC
TF = (TC * 1.8) + 32
(TF - 32) / 1.8 = TC

In these equations, the 273, 32, and 1.8 are "Exact Numbers" which do not affect the number of significant figures in the equation.

The teacher wants one step conversions and two step conversions handled separately.  For instance, to convert from milligrams to kilograms, "show your work" requirements in this course will demand converting the amount first to grams, and then converting the amount from grams to kilograms.

I'm not really fluent with scientific notation.  I need to do the practice in the workbook, I think.  The teacher worked an example on the board that I didn't really follow well enough to copy it into my notebook.  Sigh.  I'm so slow at conversions.

The gist of the equation on the board was that 0.005 ks = 5 x 10^-3 s and then x 10^12 ns for a total of 5 x 10^9 ns.
