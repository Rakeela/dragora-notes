9:24.  Just got up.

10:34.  Done with morning stuff...  wait no.  Done with Nationstates.  Flight Rising remains.

10:40.  Done with Flight Rising.

10:43.  I have lots of ideas, but realizing them is so much work.  I'm daunted.  My ideas flee before the light.  I'm unfocused.  I thought yesterday that I might just read today.

11:11.  Posting some rhetoric.  I'm too intimidated to do advertising work.  Calling people I don't know, at organizations with which I'm not familiar, hoping to post ads?  Wow, yikes.  How do I know if anything will work?  So far, it doesn't.  I'm gonna go play Starfield.  I'll set a forty minute timer... once I get the game loaded, which might take five minutes itself.

12:15.  Loading Starfield did indeed take about five minutes (slightly less), and then I did indeed play for forty minutes.  What'd I do for the rest of the time since my last time point?  I kinda wandered.  Sat around.  Paced.  Thought, I guess.

12:19.  Time is drifting.  My head hurts.

12:20.  Took headache medicine.  Even reading would be more productive than this.  No, wait.  Reading isn't too bad.

12:50.  Nothing works.  I'm not doing anything.

12:51.  I'm just being mentally ill.  I can't focus productively.  I'm not even reading.  Except reading a screen, I guess.

12:52.  I'm being a billionaire again.  Someone who uses resources and doesn't help others.

12:53.  I'm going to go to the store and check for cookies that I won't even buy because I'm thinking of setting a new fasting record.  I will bring a book, so I will at least get some reading done.

14:28.  I've consumed twice my already high level of caffeine consumption today.  I want focus.  I can't find it.  I'm just dying slowly today.  I want to live forever, but I need help to function.

14:30.  42,951.

14:31.  42,950.

14:34.  42,952.

15:41.  44,166.  1,215 words of progress.  My ideas keep running dry.  2,973 words on the chapter.

16:34.  45,169.  2,218 words of progress.  My ideas have run dry again.  I have set myself a dilemma to resolve.

18:54.  I played Starfield for a while again.  I didn't really want to do that, but I didn't want to do anything.  I have vague ideas in my writing, but nothing I can pin down.
