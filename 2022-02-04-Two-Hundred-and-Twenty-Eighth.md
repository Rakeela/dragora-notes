I dreamed something strange last night.  I dreamed of war in the outer orbits of the solar system.  All the gas giants were involved.  The war was fought with robots, and there were a lot of robots in the dream, including anthropomorphic robots such as Vader-san's "synths".  When all seemed lost, at one point somehow, it was revealed that the moons of the gas giants had been converted into super-ships.

But what was lost and why, I can't recall.  I'm not sure how much sense the dream made in its original context.  There was something about cheese as well, culminating in a pun made about the "emen-taller" nature of the moon-ships.

I'm exhausted today and I think I've already hit my writing quota, so I'm letting my attention wander a bit.
