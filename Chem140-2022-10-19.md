Exam 2 will cover through chapter 4, 9, 10, and 5, with coverage up to next Wednesday (10-26).

7s 7p 7d 7f 7g 7h 7i
6s 6p 6d 6f 6g 6h
5s 5p 5d 5f 5g
4s 4p 4d 4f
3s 3p 3d
2s 2p
1s

This diagonal striping on this chart is such that the sequence is
1s
2s
2p 3s
3p 4s
3d 4p 5s
4d 5p 6s
4f 5d 6p 7s
5f 6d 7p

2 electrons per s, 6 electrons per p, 10 electrons per d, 14 electrons per f, 18 electrons per g, 22 electrons per h, and 26 electrons per i.

The condensed electron configuration of polonium is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^10 4p^6 5s^2 4d^10 5p^6 6s^2 4f^14 5d^10 6p^4

I don't know how to record the orbital box diagrams in this form factor.

Short hand or noble gas configuration
Starting from the nearest noble gas instead of from the start.
The noble gas configuration of Polonium is [Xe] 6s^2 4f^14 5d^10 6p^4.  This short hand would involve memorizing the noble gas electron configurations, wouldn't it?

Core electrons are in subshells other than the outermost s and p shells.  The valence electrons are in the outermost s and p shells.  There are at most 8 valence electrons per atom.

Noble gas configurations
Helium:  1s^2
Neon:  1s^2 2s^2 2p^6
Argon:  1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6
Krypton:  1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^10 4p^6
Xenon:  1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^10 4p^6 5s^2 4d^10 5p^6
Radon:  1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^10 4p^6 5s^2 4d^10 5p^6 6s^2 4f^14 5d^10 6p^6

I feel there's a pattern here that should help summarize this, but that I've failed to grasp it.

Isoelectronic means "having the same electron configuration".  The examples are given of Na+, Mg2+, Al3+, N3-, O2-, F- as being isoelectronic with Ne.  They all have the same electron configuration with 10 electrons each.

This is a very basic lesson, but the teacher has emphasized it again, so I will record it again.  Atoms try to complete the octet, by losing, gaining, or sharing electrons.

She has also emphasized that electrons tend to pair up.
