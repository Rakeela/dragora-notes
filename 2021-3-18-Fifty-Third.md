Biological lifeforms are biomachinery.  It is not necessary to stop entropy to repair them indefinitely, just as it is not necessary to stop entropy to repair a vehicle indefinitely.  We need only be able to create the fascimile of a known good state.

I noticed yesterday that crows have a vanity.  There is something about their appearance that is their own choice to shape, and which may distinguish individuals from one another.  They trim their own beaks, and they do so in different ways; one of the crows who dwells near my house is notable for the unusually stout shape of her beak.

I'm trying to fast again.  So far, I'm not keeping my fast.  I'm frustrated and ashamed.  There's a mental discipline that I don't have consistently.  More than that, there's a *faith* that I don't have consistently.  Fasting for self-abuse tests only discipline, but fasting for self-love tests both discipline and faith.

I don't know if I could keep a self-loathing fast.  The thought is supremely bizarre to me.  Denying pleasure for any purpose other than that of securing greater future pleasures seems nonsensical to me.  I don't think I'm very prone to self-loathing, and I don't think it's ethically necessary.  I think people who deny themselves in self-hatred are in a medical kind of bad shape.

I fast for self-love, and that requires faith.  I have to believe that it'll work.  I have to believe that momentary discomforts are irrelevant vs greater future rewards.  The eventual limiter on the duration for which I fast is always faith.  If I believed I could live indefinitely without food and that every weakness, pain, or ounce of suffering would pass without incident, I would be able to fast for very long durations, though as a glutton I still would not fast in a truly indefinite manner.

A group of stalking anti-honesty authoritarians were *very fascinated* by the idea that I would fast.  They loathe both integrity and life; they're nihilists who detest hedonism, believe that life should be meaningless, and assign themselves an unlimited narcissistic right to violate others without being violated in turn.  I don't know how people can live like that.  They seem to think it's fun in the moment, but it ruins their psychology if they keep doing it.  When I mention this group, I *don't* know what they expected of my fasting.  My best guess is that they thought it was some kind of penance, but I don't believe in fasting as penance, and I've done nothing to atone for in any such way.  I've been lawful and peaceful all my life; I haven't hurt anyone else the way the people I'm talking about consider themselves to have the sacred right of hurting anyone they please.

No, I fast for self-love.  I resent that food is punished by the mechanics of biology in this world, and I want to overcome that someday (I long for gluttony algorithms as other people would long for narcoalgorithms).  In the meanwhile, I am held to biological requirements to which I did not and would have not consented, and per those requirements, there are greater future pleasures attainable with regular fasting.  Basically, I can eat whatever I want without gaining weight, as long as I do so rarely enough!

I just really don't have a lot of faith that every day to day discomfort will pass without incident.  I don't trust the state of my body.  I've had bad experiences with trying to ignore discomforts.  I'm afraid someday I'll have worse ones.  I still have that odd potassium dependency as well, though not as distinctly as I once did, and in that respect I really don't ultimately know what's wrong with me.  What if anything progresses that issue?  What slows that issue?  What IS that issue?

Maybe if I natter at my notes archives about how woe-is-fasting, I'll stick to it.  Heh.
