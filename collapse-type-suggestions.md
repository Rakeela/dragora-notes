# Collapse Type Suggestions

This is the online development thread for my ideas for collapse types that could theoretically be implemented in The Viceroy were it an actively developed game.  The thread itself can be found here:
* https://steamcommunity.com/app/387430/discussions/0/3106888980059684001/

The complete and partial suggestions thus far formed are as follows.

Rogue AI Rebellion (Complete & Submitted)
This sector has been destroyed by crazy artificial intelligences whose psychology went completely outside of normal operating parameters. The commonwealth needs this set straight so that it stops impairing public faith in the galaxy’s advanced AI technologies.
Challenges:
Logic Locking (The sapient machinery in this district is stuck contemplating an unusual, poorly defined, or extremely theoretical consideration with no likelihood of returning results in definable timelines. Science penalty.)  1
Obsessive Symmetry (This planet is ruled by AIs who refuse to tolerate development which they don’t consider ‘beautiful’, seriously impairing the development and deployment of heavy industrial processes. Industry specialty penalty.)  2
Rampant Wardrones (The sectors of this planet are controlled by and/or dedicated to fighting against control by AI wardrones, and the galaxy is horrified. Influence penalty.)  3
Biological Embargo (Stock. Biological specialty penalty.)  4
Determinist Culture (Stock. Happiness penalty.)  5
Hollowed System (Stock. Base industry penalty.)  6
Replicating Minefield (Stock. Trade penalty.)  7
Inhuman Prioritization (This district’s economy is geared towards servicing priorities that make sense only to artificial intelligences, and its ability to meet the needs of its inhabitants has been severely compromised. Happiness penalty.)  8
Tyrannical Omniscience (This system is suffering close governance by an AI overlord intolerant of biological variation and only grudgingly working towards the public service obligations it was installed to serve. Happiness penalty.)  9
Special features:
Every system comes pre-installed with at least one Panarchic 'Overseer' technology.


Second suggestion:  (Complete?)
Eternal Cold War
Although less devastated than many of the sectors which come to attention of the Commonwealth Viceroys, this sector is split by persistent hatreds and stagnating conflicts that never quite rise to open warfare.  There is little truth here, and less beauty; the people in this territory have lost the ability to interact with their own culture, much less anyone else's.
Challenges:
Paranoid Culture (Stock. Cultural specialty penalty.)  1
Replicating Minefield (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  2
Psychosocial Turbine (Recurrent cultural and ideological conflicts in this district have gained near-perfect cyclic qualities.  While the sincerity of the struggle draws grim fascination from some Panarchists, the majority of the participants only feel a stress of perpetual misrule.  Happiness penalty.)  3
Perfectionist Infosec (This society's unwillingness to use computer hardware and software that it hasn't exhaustively verified has resulted in an IT industry dominated by obsessively perfecting and renewing millenia old technical solutions.  Computational systems, calculation-intensive operations, and all IT development timelines are considerably slowed throughout the system.  Science penalty.)  4
Judgmental Culture (Stock.  Cultural specialty penalty.)  5
Rational Paranoia (Manipulative and conspiratorial social organization has become devastatingly common in this district, and hidden conflicts ruin lives often enough that wary paranoiacs are the only people gaining an advantage from it.  Happiness penalty.)  6
Closed Culture (Stock. Cultural specialty penalty.)  7
History of Horrors (Stock.  Influence penalty.)  8
Incompetent Regime (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  9
Special features:
Sector retains some Commonwealth projects, most commonly patriotic indoctrination.

Third suggestion:  (Complete?)
Haunted by Beyonders
A combination of twisted hyperspatial geography and a too-fervent rejection of imperial culture can destroy the normal positive relations between the public and the Beyonders, and it has done so here.  The usually subtle presence of the Beyonders has become a kind of hyperspatial poisoning in this region that the Commonwealth needs to prove it can overcome.
Challenges:
Probability Plague (An infectious and incurable hyperspace plague is shifting random event profiles chaotically across this planet.  Although the effect is mathematically self-neutralizing, extreme individual luck variations have been breaking good plans and exalting bad ones.  Rate of return penalty.)  1
Psychosocial Turbine (Recurrent cultural and ideological conflicts in this district have gained near-perfect cyclic qualities.  While the sincerity of the struggle draws grim fascination from some Panarchists, the majority of the participants only feel a stress of perpetual misrule.  Happiness penalty.)  2
Hyperspace Infections (Stock.  Reproduction penalty.)  3
Climactic Disruption (Stock.  Biological specialist penalty.)  4
Paranoid Culture (Stock.  Cultural specialist penalty.)  5
Malignant Hyperconnection (A hyperspace link of alien design has been woven between the minds of the people across this system, spreading the awareness of unhappiness from person to person across much larger distances than anyone can do anything about.  Although the people here try harder than most to keep each other happy, misery is far more inescapable.  Happiness penalty.)  6
Anti-Beyonder Investors (The financial establishment in this district is convinced that Beyonder financial advice is wholly dedicated to the long-term ruin of the market.  This is rarely if ever true.  Morever, local efforts to defy or manipulate Beyonder financial strategies amount to sacred incompetence.  Investment return penalty.)  7
Hyperspace Stunning (The people in this system are prone to poorly-timed moments of mathematical fugue.  While the result has been in many ways a remarkable society, the rate of lethal accidents has increased, and esoteric mathematical fixations have partially displaced the public's reproductive drive.  Reproduction penalty.)  8
Market Collapse (Stock.  Investment return penalty.)  9
Special features:
Sector always contains an artificial dreamtime and at least one jaunting grid, having otherwise no imperial projects among its protected initial projects.

Fourth suggestion: (Incomplete)
Hyper-Isolated Development
A recent campaign of long-term redevelopment in this region fell apart due to difficult planetary geographies, inefficiencies of greed, and unexpected petty factionalization.  The region is suffering from de facto long-term isolation despite the attempts of the Commonwealth to attend to it, and a corrective Viceregal administration has been authorized.
Challenges:
Poor Local Logistics (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  1
Debris Ring (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  2
Mansion Fixation  (The people of this district are keen and competitive property-owners who all want to have as much real estate for their own use as possible.  High land values are a fact of life here and the public is hypersensitized to crowding.  Crowding limit penalty.)  3
Industrial Favoritism (Stock.  Industrial specialty penalty.)  4
Malinvestment (Stock.  Rate of return penalty.)  5
Market Isolation (Stock.  Rate of return penalty.)  6
Political Oversight (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  7
Entrenched Monopolies  (Stock.  Industrial specialty penalty.)  8
Civil Unrest  (Stock.  Base culture penalty.)  9
Special features:
(None?)  (Sector favors industrial production?)

Fifth suggestion: (Incomplete)
Stasis Collapse
The love of immortality and long-term planning set in so completely in this region that its economy locked up with inactivity, became technically unsustainable, and started shedding advancements that had been upholding the public's quality of life.  The Panarchy has temporarily withdrawn immortality from the region and requested a viceregal administration to reactivate the stalled economy.
Challenges:
Zero Birth Culture (Stock.  Reproduction penalty.)  1
Eternal Philosophers  (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  2
Extreme Family Planning  (Many of the people of this planet are ostensibly not against reproduction, but their extraordinarily perfectionistic parental ideals and multicentennial attitude towards parenting function that way regardless.  Reproduction penalty.)  3
Hyperspace Stunning (The people in this system are prone to poorly-timed moments of mathematical fugue.  While the result has been in many ways a remarkable society, the rate of lethal accidents has increased, and esoteric mathematical fixations have partially displaced the public's reproductive drive.  Reproduction penalty.)  4
Logic Locking (The sapient machinery in this district is stuck contemplating an unusual, poorly defined, or extremely theoretical consideration with no likelihood of returning results in definable timelines. Science penalty.)  5
Drinkers of Nepenthe (Unlearning medications aka 'Nepenthe' are common in advanced societies, because they are necessary for accelerated skill redevelopment and the indefinite maintenance of psychological health.  Some individuals become drawn to the drugs recreationally, and the resulting constant unlearning reverses the skill-developing intentions of Nepenthe.  This planet's ability to contribute to advanced technological development is crippled by just how often the public is wallowing in Nepenthe.  Science penalty.)  6
Perfectionist Infosec (This society's unwillingness to use computer hardware and software that it hasn't exhaustively verified has resulted in an IT industry dominated by obsessively perfecting and renewing millennia old technical solutions.  Computational systems, calculation-intensive operations, and all IT development timelines are considerably slowed throughout the system.  Science penalty.)  7
VLT Projects (Industrial planners on this planet are obsessed with very-long-term projects whose return periods are awesome even by galactic standards.  Whlie such endeavors are sometimes very praiseworthy and successful in advanced societies, their local dominance is making the planetary industrial base unresponsive over normal planning intervals.  Industrial base penalty.)  8
(1 Unset)
Special features:
(Unset)

Sixth suggestion: (Incomplete)
Agri-Nanite Apocalypse
A very advanced society developed here seeking to feed the galaxy with extraordinary amounts of food exports.  It worked really well for a while, but their auto-optimizing nanotechnological agricultural system has become difficult to understand and difficult to trade with.  Commonwealth negotiators have achieved consent from the swarm hive for a recolonization mission, and are dispatching a viceroy.
Challenges:
Psuedourbanism (This planet is built up bizarrely to provide 'living' and 'recreational' spaces for sapient nanite collectives.  While the resulting buildings are fascinating in various ways and are in limited quantities essential on any planet recovering from an assimilation crisis, entire 'cities' of this architecture amount to nothing but nigh-unusable terrain.  Crowding penalty.)  1
Uncoalesced (Save for a few immigrant specialists, this district's population is entirely composed of a nanite soup.  Although the swarm can be directed in employment producing conventional industrial goods as well as exotic biochemicals in exchange for cultural imports, its own cultural artifacts are few and incomprehensible.  Base culture penalty.)  2
Recoalescent (This planet's population is having difficulty producing a limited number of distinct intelligences; essentially, the population is a swarm hive lacking individualism, and its actual population is presently far more indeterminate than Commonwealth metrics can represent.  Basic productivity is surprisingly unimpaired by the chaos, but the planet's financial markets are difficult to comprehend and highly error-prone due to legal and technical difficulties in establishing designations of ownership and control.  Rate of return penalty.)  3
Emulated Nanoinfluence (The designed-sapience psychologies of this planet's population resist 'wasting time' with normal social interactions and independent personal development to an extent which contributed to the region's erosion during the assimilation crisis and risks impairing the development of large scale talent networks going forward.  Influence penalty.)  4
Protean Wilderness (The reshaped ecology of this world has been integrated with its ubiquitous pollution of nanites and bioengineering experiments to produce an environment of bizarre and horrifically dangerous creatures.  While only a minor military threat compared to the organized might of an advanced society, having to deploy ubiquitous militarized defenses against 'nature' creates a society dreary and immiserated.  Happiness penalty.)  5
Hyperspatial Fungus (Calculational pollution of local hyperspace has encouraged the proliferation of a form of a hyperspatial life harmless to us, but highly aversive to Beyonders.  It's difficult to summon them from this system and it's difficult to convince Beyonders on open-ended summons to travel to it.  Their absence impairs the development of local financial markets.  Rate of return penalty.) 6
(3 Unset)
Special features:
On average, the districts in this territory have poor cultural productivity scores.

Seventh suggestion: (Incomplete)
Grey Goo
This formerly panarchic region recklessly maximized its deployment of machine intelligence and accidentally created a system far less discriminate than intended.  Commonwealth military forces have established beachheads in suitable district capitol sites, and our diplomats have established formal economic contact with the 'native population' of swarm hive intelligences.  A minority of the swarm hive has continued military opposition in some distracts and appears to be hyperspace capable.
Challenges:
Rebel Faction (Stock.  Influence penalty.)  1
Psuedourbanism (This planet is built up bizarrely to provide 'living' and 'recreational' spaces for sapient nanite collectives.  While the resulting buildings are fascinating in various ways and are in limited quantities essential on any planet recovering from an assimilation crisis, entire 'cities' of this architecture amount to nothing but nigh-unusable terrain.  Crowding penalty.)  2
Uncoalesced (Save for a few immigrant specialists, this district's population is entirely composed of a nanite soup.  Although the swarm can be directed in employment producing conventional industrial goods as well as exotic biochemicals in exchange for cultural imports, its own cultural artifacts are few and incomprehensible.  Base culture penalty.)  3
Recoalescent (This planet's population is having difficulty producing a limited number of distinct intelligences; essentially, the population is a swarm hive lacking individualism, and its actual population is presently far more indeterminate than Commonwealth metrics can represent.  Basic productivity is surprisingly unimpaired by the chaos, but the planet's financial markets are difficult to comprehend and highly error-prone due to legal and technical difficulties in establishing designations of ownership and control.  Rate of return penalty.)  4
Emulated Nanoinfluence (The designed-sapience psychologies of this planet's population resist 'wasting time' with normal social interactions and independent personal development to an extent which contributed to the region's erosion during the assimilation crisis and risks impairing the development of large scale talent networks going forward.  Influence Penalty.)  5
Hollowed System (Stock. Base industry penalty.)  6
(3 Unset)
Special features:
(Unset)

Eighth Suggestion: (Incomplete)
Localist Catastrophe
Everything that galactic society decided it could afford to ignore in this society turned out to be a worst case scenario, and the local politicians were a gruesome spectrum of incompetent and evil.  Massive breaches of trust have destroyed the regional government, which will now need to be rebuilt.  Specialization is severely impaired in this region, and close attention may be necessary to usefully respecialize the districts.
Challenges:
Political Oversight (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  1
Brutal Justice (Stock.  Cultural specialist penalty.)  2
Unscrupulous Society (Stock.  Industrial specialist penalty.)  3
Overspecialization (Stock.  Industrial specialist penalty.)  4
Market Collapse (Stock.  Rate of return penalty.)  5
Industrial Pollution (Stock.  Biological specialist penalty.)  6
Genetic Stupidity (Stock.  Science capacity penalty.)  7
System-Wide Quarantine (Stock.  Biological specialist penalty.)  8
Incompetent Regime (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  9
Special Features:
(Unset)

Ninth Suggestion: (Incomplete)
Research Conspiracy Aftermath
This territory was recently liberated from a rogue Panarchic government which shielded itself from galactic society's observation using local hyperspace severing, and then used its local population for long-term social experimentation.  Public bleakness under these hopeless conditions increased to such an extreme as to give the system a ruinous infamy; this infamy helped lead to rescue, but may now benefit from repair.
Challenges:
Panarchic Wargames (The Panarchy has assigned large contingents of military forces to this planet for training, research, and recreational purposes.  While these are technically allied forces operating lawfully, their presence is both expensive and disruptive, increasing supply and maintenance costs planet-wide.  Upkeep penalty.)  1 
Scientific Guilds (Stock.  Science capacity penalty.)  2
Psychosocial Turbine (Recurrent cultural and ideological conflicts in this district have gained near-perfect cyclic qualities.  While the sincerity of the struggle draws grim fascination from some Panarchists, the majority of the participants only feel a stress of perpetual misrule.  Happiness penalty.)  3
Petty Dictator (Stock.  Influence penalty.)  4
Unscrupulous Society (Stock.  Industrial specialist penalty.)  5
History of Horrors (Stock.  Influence penalty.)  6
Spiritually Broken (Stock.  Cultural specialist penalty.)  7
Restrictive Education (Stock.  Scientific capacity penalty.)  8
Hyperspace Darkness (Stock.  Happiness penalty.)  9
Special Features:
(Unset)

Tenth Suggestion: (Incomplete)
Locked AI Collective
This previously Imperial territory developed a large base of Panarchic cognitechnologies, in the process developing a 'perfectly proven' perfect way of life.  The bland repetitiveness that subsequently developed in its cultural products proved the canary in the coalmine for a society in the process of proving itself not to exist.  This society needs help rebooting its research systems... literally.  They may also benefit from a little more help finding their own individual voices in life.
Challenges:
Common Culture (Stock.  Cultural base penalty.)  1
Emulated Nanoinfluence (The designed-sapience psychologies of this planet's population resist 'wasting time' with normal social interactions and independent personal development to an extent which contributed to the region's erosion during the assimilation crisis and risks impairing the development of large scale talent networks going forward.  Influence Penalty.)  2
Logic Locking (The sapient machinery in this district is stuck contemplating an unusual, poorly defined, or extremely theoretical consideration with no likelihood of returning results in definable timelines. Science penalty.)  3
Eternal Philosophers (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  4
Overspecialization  (Stock.  Industrial specialist penalty.)  5
Paradigm Shift  (Stock.  Rate of return penalty.)  6
Extreme Family Planning  (Many of the people of this planet are ostensibly not against reproduction, but their extraordinarily perfectionistic parental ideals and multicentennial attitude towards parenting function that way regardless.  Reproduction penalty.)  7
Obsessive Symmetry (This planet is ruled by AIs who refuse to tolerate development which they don’t consider ‘beautiful’, seriously impairing the development and deployment of heavy industrial processes. Industrial specialist penalty.)  8
Existential Dissociation (These people don't believe in their own existence.  Local culture asserts with the force of consensus that the entirety of this planet is just a single emanation of a probabilistic pattern with billions of individual-like facets.  The effect that this has on individual psychology is not positive, as the resulting individuals are very bad at pursuing their own interests, and get very chaotic when their interests are poorly served as a result.  Happiness penalty.)
Special Features:
Technical overseers throughout the territory.

Eleventh Suggestion:  (Incomplete)
Anti-Sustainability Crisis
Massive skepticism of economic regulatory functions in government and society have lead to a breakdown in regulatory controls throughout this region.  Although local political leaders have protested the Viceregal intervention with claims that they are engaging in productive anti-bureaucratic governance, pollution and disease are spreading in the shadow of an industriously filthy rebellion.  The industrial economy is powerful in this territory, but misery is pervasive and a reliance on importing biological products may be inevitable.
Challenges:
(9 Unset)
Special Features:
Generally high industry scores, local governments widespread

Twelth Suggestion:  (Incomplete)
Palatial Shambles
The cities of a monumentally developed society have shuddered apart in waves of growth and emigration, with the territory's economy revealing the hazards of being economically dependent on transient cultural tastes and highly advanced methods of increasing the productivity of cultural specialists.  Repair or work around the territory's long-term cultural deficits, and help these people find comfort in the terms of life in their crowded cities.
Challenges:
Extreme Housing Inequality (Celestial palaces crowd the listings in this system's real estate, but what the public calls an apartment is too small to be entirely sanitary.  The extent and visibility of the gap inspires rage and envy in the public, but perhaps worse is that it inspires a hopelessness destructive to the development of talent.  Happiness penalty.)  1
Melange File (One of the less safe narcoalgorithmic cognitive adjustment nanotechnologies is permanently 'in vogue' in this district.  Known as a melange file, it renews the hedonic treadmill via partial personality overwrite.  Overuse of melange files leads to on-going personality drift, scrambling galactic society's ability to give these people permanent roles in a larger culture.  Influence penalty.)  2
Blandeur (This district's culture is austere, magnificent, and painfully short of people taking actual creative risks.  The local consensus about how things ought to look has stifled cultural productivity.  Blandeur is considered a variation of common culture, with many of the same policy implications.  Culture base penalty.)  3
Panarchic Wargames (The Panarchy has assigned large contingents of military forces to this planet for training, research, and recreational purposes.  While these are technically allied forces operating lawfully, their presence is both expensive and disruptive, increasing supply and maintenance costs planet-wide.  Upkeep penalty.)  4
Reclusive AI Utopia  (This system has become dominated by powerful AI who claim that they wish to avoid influencing galactic culture.  As a result of their efforts, a great fraction of the population is comprised of sapient machinery and upload cluster residents who are incapable of or resistant to providing cultural exports through the gates, but who claim to seek contentment in trading real goods for cultural imports.   Culture base penalty.)  5
Anti-Statisticians  (Long-term economic planning has been crushed on this planet by competitively-designed AI bankers whose attempts to subvert all exploitable patterns render the local market impenetrable and incomprehensible.  Rate of return penalty.)  6
Rubbish Imports  (Additionally to the trade flows tracked by the Commonwealth as productive, this planet is signed on to many galactic trade pacts with the cumulative impact that its markets are flooded with inferior goods.  The resulting 'low quality society' has an infamy not conducive to high revenues in cultural exports, though the local cuisine is pretty good.  Culture base penalty.)  7
Zero Birth Culture (Stock.  Reproductive penalty.)  8
Formerly Important. (Stock.  Happiness penalty.)  9
Special Features:
Increased base crowding limits on many districts, at least one space elevator, at least one permanently protected AI

Thirteenth suggestion:  (Incomplete)
Mercurial Sea
Society in this region is ruled by a system of black box intelligences thinking incomprehensible thoughts in seas of computational substrate.  The remaining biological citizens and some of the more comprehensible AIs consider this a state of collapse, and the Commonwealth has answered their cries for an intervention.
Challenges:
Uncoalesced  (Save for a few immigrant specialists, this district's population is entirely composed of a nanite soup.  Although the swarm can be directed in employment producing conventional industrial goods as well as exotic biochemicals in exchange for cultural imports, its own cultural artifacts are few and incomprehensible.  Base culture penalty.)  1
Emulated Nanoinfluence  (The designed-sapience psychologies of this planet's population resist 'wasting time' with normal social interactions and independent personal development to an extent which contributed to the region's erosion during the assimilation crisis and risks impairing the development of large scale talent networks going forward.  Influence Penalty.)  2
Psuedourbanism  (This planet is built up bizarrely to provide 'living' and 'recreational' spaces for sapient nanite collectives.  While the resulting buildings are fascinating in various ways and are in limited quantities essential on any planet recovering from an assimilation crisis, entire 'cities' of this architecture amount to nothing but nigh-unusable terrain.  Crowding penalty.)  3
Assimilationist Computronium  (This planet's population is regularly assailed by nano-swarm criminals who try to convert all others into their own kind of being.  Law and order has not wholly failed, but misery is widespread and the nano-combat equipped population is more useful to violent rebellion than it is to the Commonwealth. Happiness penalty.)  4
Anti-Statisticians  (Long-term economic planning has been crushed on this planet by competitively-designed AI bankers whose attempts to subvert all exploitable patterns render the local market impenetrable and incomprehensible.  Rate of return penalty.)  5
Extremist Nano-Environmentalism  (Industrial specialization on this planet has been crushed by militant nanite collectives which have strengthened its wilderness areas astonishingly.  Industrial planners exist in terrified compliance with the restrictions placed on them by the local nano-enhanced ecology.  Industrial specialty penalty.)  6
Melange File (One of the less safe narcoalgorithmic cognitive adjustment nanotechnologies is permanently 'in vogue' in this district.  Known as a melange file, it renews the hedonic treadmill via partial personality overwrite.  Overuse of melange files leads to on-going personality drift, scrambling galactic society's ability to give these people permanent roles in a larger culture.  Influence penalty.)  7
(2 Unset)
Special Features:
Ubiquitous Thinking Dust improvements.

I may want to start adding cure-tech proposals to each of these.  For instance, my intent with Anti-Statisticians is that it would be cured with Distributed Thought, representing that the public can cure the AI chaos problem by learning to re-interpret the investment market from first principles rather than remaining bound to mistaken prior understandings.  This practice of falling back gently upon the underutilized minds so that their understanding helps society develop is very much the kind of thing that I imagine the Old Imperials taking pleasure in.

---
Come to think of the Old Imperials 'taking pleasure' in fixing a challenge, is each challenge something detested by the faction which can fix it?  Is this part of the implied competing ideological structures in this game's setting?

I can imagine for instance that if a Panarchic AI Collective took over a region with antistatisticians infesting its market, they might instead enjoy building up the infrastructure to retake the market for more civilized and cooperative AI bankers.  They would contest the antistatisticians as fellow AI citizens and integrate them into their computerized markets.  This approach is slightly more expensive overall, but it's also friendlier.

Sufficiently advanced AIs are actual people.  If the Old Imperials construct a 'hyperspace market' out of the distributed understanding potential of the populous as a whole to coordinate behavior such that over-competitive market AIs get frozen out of it, they're making actual people suffer isolation and sudden incompetence in a form of economic endeavor they would otherwise be able to retain a place in indefinitely.

---
Panarchic Wargames should probably be cured by the Panarchic Naval Port.  Once you have that development, you have the societal infrastructure to integrate the disruptive potential of the wargames in a regular manner.  So even though it's a very Panarchy problem, it also has a very Panarchy solution.  I think this represents a fair externality of the Panarchy.  Their overbuilt recreational military is partially everywhere.  It's mostly harmless, but it's too real to be free in its passage.

Once I have enough thoughts on cure techs built up, I'll know what kind of cure tech thoughts pages I should build.  Hm...  I wonder if I can write a book on [[The-Viceroy]].  Is that fair play in culture?  I think it's a very impressive work and I'd be glad to extend its reach a bit more if I could.

---
Challenge concepts that I don't have anywhere else to put:
Cultural Hypercompetition  (The people of this planet have a broadly unidirectional engagement with galactic culture, in that they measure themselves against the best in the galaxy, yet have themselves no local talent of such renown.  The resulting sense of perpetual inadequacy makes local cultural specialists timid and easily discouraged.  Cultural specialist penalty.)
Law of Love  (The highly developed strictures of romantic and sexual ethics in this system are so widely followed and consistently supported by the public that reproductive rates are depressed system-wide.  Reproductive penalty.) - I intend that this would be cured with Reproduction Mandate, should a player dare.

---
This is [[existential-threat]] style thinking, and may also deserve some form of shared categorization with those notes.  How can any one organizational structure ever be provably optimal for a sufficiently complex set of information?
