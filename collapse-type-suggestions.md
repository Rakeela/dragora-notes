# Collapse Type Suggestions

This is the online development thread for my ideas for collapse types that could theoretically be implemented in The Viceroy were it an actively developed game.  The thread itself can be found here:

The complete and partial suggestions thus far formed are as follows.

Rogue AI Rebellion (Complete & Submitted)
This sector has been destroyed by crazy artificial intelligences whose psychology went completely outside of normal operating parameters. The commonwealth needs this set straight so that it stops impairing public faith in the galaxy’s advanced AI technologies.
Challenges:
Logic Locking (The sapient machinery in this district is stuck contemplating an unusual, poorly defined, or extremely theoretical consideration with no likelihood of returning results in definable timelines. Science penalty.)  1
Obsessive Symmetry (This planet is ruled by AIs who refuse to tolerate development which they don’t consider ‘beautiful’, seriously impairing the development and deployment of heavy industrial processes. Industry specialty penalty.)  2
Rampant Wardrones (The sectors of this planet are controlled by and/or dedicated to fighting against control by AI wardrones, and the galaxy is horrified. Influence penalty.)  3
Biological Embargo (Stock. Biological specialty penalty.)  4
Determinist Culture (Stock. Happiness penalty.)  5
Hollowed System (Stock. Base industry penalty.)  6
Replicating Minefield (Stock. Trade penalty.)  7
Inhuman Prioritization (This district’s economy is geared towards servicing priorities that make sense only to artificial intelligences, and its ability to meet the needs of its inhabitants has been severely compromised. Happiness penalty.)  8
Tyrannical Omniscience (This system is suffering close governance by an AI overlord intolerant of biological variation and only grudgingly working towards the public service obligations it was installed to serve. Happiness penalty.)  9
Special features:
Every system comes pre-installed with at least one Panarchic 'Overseer' technology.


Second suggestion:  (Complete?)
Eternal Cold War
Although less devastated than many of the sectors which come to attention of the Commonwealth Viceroys, this sector is split by persistent hatreds and stagnating conflicts that never quite rise to open warfare.  There is little truth here, and less beauty; the people in this territory have lost the ability to interact with their own culture, much less anyone else's.
Challenges:
Paranoid Culture (Stock. Cultural specialty penalty.)  1
Replicating Minefield (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  2
Psychosocial Turbine (Recurrent cultural and ideological conflicts in this district have gained near-perfect cyclic qualities.  While the sincerity of the struggle draws grim fascination from some Panarchists, the majority of the participants only feel a stress of perpetual misrule.  Happiness penalty.)  3
Perfectionist Infosec (This society's unwillingness to use computer hardware and software that it hasn't exhaustively verified has resulted in an IT industry dominated by obsessively perfecting and renewing millenia old technical solutions.  Computational systems, calculation-intensive operations, and all IT development timelines are considerably slowed throughout the system.  Science penalty.)  4
Judgmental Culture (Stock.  Cultural specialty penalty.)  5
Rational Paranoia (Manipulative and conspiratorial social organization has become devastatingly common in this district, and hidden conflicts ruin lives often enough that wary paranoiacs are the only people gaining an advantage from it.  Happiness penalty.)  6
Closed Culture (Stock. Cultural specialty penalty.)  7
History of Horrors (Stock.  Influence penalty.)  8
Incompetent Regime (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  9
Special features:
Sector retains some Commonwealth projects, most commonly patriotic indoctrination.

Third suggestion:  (Complete?)
Haunted by Beyonders
A combination of twisted hyperspatial geography and a too-fervent rejection of imperial culture can destroy the normal positive relations between the public and the Beyonders, and it has done so here.  The usually subtle presence of the Beyonders has become a kind of hyperspatial poisoning in this region that the Commonwealth needs to prove it can clean.
Challenges:
Probability Plague (An infectious and incurable hyperspace plague is shifting random event profiles chaotically across this planet.  Although the effect is mathematically self-neutralizing, extreme individual luck variations have been breaking good plans and exalting bad ones.  Investment return penalty.)  1
Psychosocial Turbine (Recurrent cultural and ideological conflicts in this district have gained near-perfect cyclic qualities.  While the sincerity of the struggle draws grim fascination from some Panarchists, the majority of the participants only feel a stress of perpetual misrule.  Happiness penalty.)  2
Hyperspace Infections (Stock.  Reproduction penalty.)  3
Climactic Disruption (Stock.  Biological specialist penalty.)  4
Paranoid Culture (Stock.  Cultural specialist penalty.)  5
Malignant Hyperconnection (A hyperspace link of alien design has been woven between the minds of the people across this system, spreading the awareness of unhappiness from person to person across much larger distances than anyone can do anything about.  Although the people here try harder than most to keep each other happy, misery is far more inescapable.  Happiness penalty.)  6
Anti-Beyonder Investors (The financial establishment in this district is convinced that Beyonder financial advice is wholly dedicated to the long-term ruin of the market.  This is rarely if ever true.  Morever, local efforts to defy or manipulate Beyonder financial strategies amount to sacred incompetence.  Investment return penalty.)  7
Hyperspace Stunning (The people in this system are prone to poorly-timed moments of mathematical fugue.  While the result has been in many ways a remarkable society, the rate of lethal accidents has increased, and esoteric mathematical fixations have partially displaced the public's reproductive drive.  Reproduction penalty.)  8
Market Collapse (Stock.  Investment return penalty.)  9
Special features:
Sector always contains an artificial dreamtime and at least one jaunting grid, having otherwise no imperial projects among its protected initial projects.

Fourth suggestion: (Incomplete)
Hyper-Isolated Development
A recent campaign of long-term redevelopment in this region fell apart due to difficult planetary geographies, inefficiencies of greed, and unexpected petty factionalization.  The region is suffering from de facto long-term isolation despite the attempts of the Commonwealth to attend to it, and a corrective Viceregal administration has been authorized.
Challenges:
Poor Local Logistics (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  1
Debris Ring (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  2
Mansion Fixation  (The people of this district are keen and competitive property-owners who all want to have as much real estate for their own use as possible.  High land values are a fact of life here and the public is hypersensitized to crowding.  Crowding limit penalty.)  3
Industrial Favoritism (Stock.  Industrial specialty penalty.)  4
Malinvestment (Stock.  Rate of return penalty.)  5
Market Isolation (Stock.  Rate of return penalty.)  6
Political Oversight (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  7
Entrenched Monopolies  (Stock.  Industrial specialty penalty.)  8
Civil Unrest  (Stock.  Base culture penalty.)  9
Special features:
(None?)  (Sector favors industrial production?)

Fifth suggestion: (Incomplete)
Stasis Collapse
The love of immortality and long-term planning set in so completely in this region that its economy locked up with inactivity, became technically unsustainable, and started shedding advancements that had been upholding the public's quality of life.  The Panarchy has temporarily withdrawn immortality from the region and requested a viceregal administration to reactivate the stalled economy.
Challenges:
Zero Birth Culture (Stock.  Reproduction penalty.)  1
Eternal Philosophers  (Stock.  Bureaucratic penalty.)  2
Extreme Family Planning  (Many of the people of this planet are ostensibly not against reproduction, but their extraordinarily perfectionistic parental ideals and multicentennial attitude towards parenting function that way regardless.  Reproduction penalty.)  3
Hyperspace Stunning (The people in this system are prone to poorly-timed moments of mathematical fugue.  While the result has been in many ways a remarkable society, the rate of lethal accidents has increased, and esoteric mathematical fixations have partially displaced the public's reproductive drive.  Reproduction penalty.)  4
Logic Locking (The sapient machinery in this district is stuck contemplating an unusual, poorly defined, or extremely theoretical consideration with no likelihood of returning results in definable timelines. Science penalty.)  5
Drinkers of Nepenthe (Unlearning medications aka 'Nepenthe' are common in advanced societies, because they are necessary for accelerated skill redevelopment and the indefinite maintenance of psychological health.  Some individuals become drawn to the drugs recreationally, and have trouble learning anything beyond the most basic skills.  This planet's ability to contribute to advanced technological development is crippled by just how often the public is wallowing in Nepenthe.  Science penalty.)  6
Perfectionist Infosec (This society's unwillingness to use computer hardware and software that it hasn't exhaustively verified has resulted in an IT industry dominated by obsessively perfecting and renewing millenia old technical solutions.  Computational systems, calculation-intensive operations, and all IT development timelines are considerably slowed throughout the system.  Science penalty.)  7
(2 Unset)
Special features:
(Unset)

Sixth suggestion: (Incomplete)
Agri-Nanite Apocalypse
A very advanced society developed here seeking to feed the galaxy with extraordinary amounts of food exports.  It worked really well for a while, but their auto-optimizing nanotechnological agricultural system has become difficult to understand and difficult to trade with.  Commonwealth negotiators have achieved consent from the swarm hive for a recolonization mission, and are dispatching a viceroy.
Challenges:
Psuedourbanism (This planet is built up bizarrely to provide living and recreational spaces... for sapient nanite collectives.  While fascinating in various ways and are in limited quantities essential on any planet recovering from an assimilation crisis, entire 'cities' of this architecture amount to nothing but nigh-unusable terrain.  Crowding penalty.)  1
(8 Unset)
Special features:
(Unset)

Seventh suggestion: (Incomplete)
Grey Goo
This formerly panarchic region recklessly maximized its deployment of machine intelligence and accidentally created a system far less discriminate than intended.  Commonwealth military forces have established beachheads in suitable district capitol sites, and our diplomats have established formal economic contact with the 'native population' of swarm hive intelligences.  A minority of the swarm hive has continued military opposition in some distracts and appears to be hyperspace capable.
Challenges:
Rebel Faction (Stock.  Influence penalty.)  1
Psuedourbanism (This planet is built up bizarrely to provide 'living' and 'recreational' spaces for sapient nanite collectives.  While the buildings are fascinating in various ways and are in limited quantities essential on any planet recovering from an assimilation crisis, entire 'cities' of this architecture amount to nothing but nigh-unusable terrain.  Crowding penalty.)  2
(8 Unset)
Special features:
(Unset)

I may want to start adding cure-tech proposals to each of these.
