# Collapse Type Suggestions

This is the online development thread for my ideas for collapse types that could theoretically be implemented in The Viceroy were it an actively developed game.  The thread itself can be found here:

The complete and partial suggestions thus far formed are as follows.

Rogue AI Rebellion (Complete & Submitted)
This sector has been destroyed by crazy artificial intelligences whose psychology went completely outside of normal operating parameters. The commonwealth needs this set straight so that it stops impairing public faith in the galaxy’s advanced AI technologies.
Challenges:
Logic Locking (The sapient machinery in this district is stuck contemplating an unusual, poorly defined, or extremely theoretical consideration with no likelihood of returning results in definable timelines. Science penalty.) 1
Obsessive Symmetry (This planet’s ruling AIs refuse to tolerate development which they don’t consider ‘beautiful’, seriously impairing the development and deployment of heavy industrial processes. Industry specialty penalty.) 2
Rampant Wardrones (The sectors of this planet are controlled by and/or dedicated to fighting against control by AI wardrones, and the galaxy is horrified. Influence penalty.). 3
Biological Embargo (Stock. Biological specialty penalty.) 4
Determinist Culture (Stock. Happiness penalty.) 5
Hollowed System (Stock. Base industry penalty.) 6
Replicating Minefield (Stock. Trade penalty.) 7
Inhuman Prioritization (This district’s economy is geared towards servicing priorities that make sense only to artificial intelligences, and its ability to meet the needs of its inhabitants has been severely compromised. Happiness penalty.) 8
Tyrannical Omniscience (This system is suffering close governance by an AI overlord intolerant of biological variation and only grudgingly working towards the public service obligations it was installed to serve. Happiness penalty.) 9
Special features:
Every system comes pre-installed with at least one Panarchic 'Overseer' technology.


Second suggestion:  (Incomplete)
Eternal Cold War
Although less devastated than many of the sectors which come to attention of the Commonwealth Viceroys, this sector is an embarrassing death of influence in the Commonwealth due to being split by persistent hatreds and stagnating conflicts.
Challenges:
Paranoid Culture (Stock. Cultural specialty penalty.)  1
Replicating Minefield (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  2
(8 Unset)
Special features:
Sector retains some Commonwealth projects, most commonly patriotic indoctrination.

Third suggestion:  (Incomplete)
Haunted by Beyonders
A combination of twisted hyperspatial geography and a too-fervent rejection of imperial culture can destroy the normal positive relations between the public and the Beyonders, and it has done so here.  The usually subtle presence of the Beyonders has become a kind of temporal poisoning in this region that the Commonwealth needs to prove it can clean.
Challenges:
Probability Plague (An infectious and incurable hyperspace plague is shifting random event profiles chaotically across this planet.  Although the effect is mathematically self-neutralizing, extreme individual luck variations have been breaking good plans and exalting bad ones.  Investment return penalty.)  1
Psychosocial Turbine (Recurrent cultural and ideological conflicts in this district have gained near-perfect cyclic qualities.  While the sincerity of the struggle draws grim fascination from some Panarchists, the majority of the participants only feel a stress of perpetual misrule.  Happiness penalty.)  2
(7 Unset)
Special features:
Sector always contains an artificial dreamtime and at least one jaunting grid, and has no imperial projects among its protected initial projects.

Fourth suggestion: (Incomplete)
Hyper-Isolated Development
A recent campaign of long-term redevelopment in this region fell apart due to accidents of geography and poor space utilization strategies.  The region is suffering from de facto long-term isolation despite the attempts of the Commonwealth to attend to it, and a corrective Viceregal administration has been authorized.
Challenges:
Isolated Geography (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  1
Orbital Debris (Stock.  Trade penalty.)  2
(7 Unset)
Special features:
(Unset)
