I've been trying to read an article about "degrowthing" strategies in political economy.  It's not going well.  I've been stymied by it for days and days.  It's just hard to think about.  I feel the article uses a lot of words to convey not a lot of information.

The primary insight that I've gleaned from it is just one stubborn thing that I think is true in a lot of... ill-conceived misunderstandings of economics.  What is the detail that the degrowther POV seems to be right about?  **The durability of consumer goods is undervalued by common measures of economic activity and wealth.**  Which is to say that regulations increasing the durability of consumer goods are undervalued in their contribution to real wealth.  It is true that if the number of consumer appliances our society made was cut in half, due to the appliances constructed lasting twice as long, our society would be wealthier despite showing an on-paper reduction of economic activity.

I'm not sure that analagous situations achieve throughout society.  I... currently intend to keep thinking about it.  I am aware that sometimes doing nothing is productivity itself; see my interpretation of the Stasis Controller technology from The Viceroy, as well as my interpretation of the Beyonder Engines.  That stuff is over on [[ideological-interpretations-of-The-Viceroy]], though I will eventually need to decluster that monster of a page.  Rewikification is going to be a difficult challenge that this archive will eventually need me to meet.

I'm not a scientist, I'm a scholastic.  Sorry.  I'm trying to be a good scholastic, but I'm aware that scholasticism is a largely-deprecated monastic endeavor...  Although, reading the wikipedia page on scholasticism suggests that I may have an outdated concept of what scholasticism is.  I remember being taught that it was a method of learning based entirely on accumulating and studying texts.  I was thinking in calling myself a scholastic to refer to the fact that my primary qualification seems to be my reading rate.

Which is not ideal.  I wish I read faster.  I know some people do!  Nor do I even read as fast as I did at my peak reading rate.  Ah, to be seven again, competing in a several-month reading competition!  What a bitter second place that was!  How memorable, how shocking, to discover that someone could read faster than *me*.

Do people ever do reading competitions in adulthood?  Can I ever find a group where I can try that again with different peers?  I dug up a site that does reading comprehension tests... on a limited library...  It wasn't good enough.

What I'm trying to say is that I'm pretty dependent on analyzing what other people write.  I've built or grown few things in my life, but I've existed in the life of the mind.  Ultimately I think the endstate of society exists wholly in the life of the mind, and I long for a virtual paradise where all is thought and thought is all.
