I've been trying to read an article about "degrowthing" strategies in political economy.  It's not going well.  I've been stymied by it for days and days.  It's just hard to think about.  I feel the article uses a lot of words to convey not a lot of information.

The primary insight that I've gleaned from it is just one stubborn thing that I think is true in a lot of... ill-conceived misunderstandings of economics.  What is the detail that the degrowther POV seems to be right about?  **The durability of consumer goods is undervalued by common measures of economic activity and wealth.**  Which is to say that regulations increasing the durability of consumer goods are undervalued in their contribution to real wealth.  It is true that if the number of consumer appliances our society made was cut in half, due to the appliances constructed lasting twice as long, our society would be wealthier despite showing an on-paper reduction of economic activity.

I'm not sure that analagous situations achieve throughout society.  I... currently intend to keep thinking about it.  I am aware that sometimes doing nothing is productivity itself; see my interpretation of the Stasis Controller technology from The Viceroy, as well as my interpretation of the Beyonder Engines.  That stuff is over on [[ideological-interpretations-of-The-Viceroy]], though I will eventually need to decluster that monster of a page.  Rewikification is going to be a difficult challenge that this archive will eventually need me to meet.

I'm not a scientist, I'm a scholastic.  Sorry.  I'm trying to be a good scholastic, but I'm aware that scholasticism is a largely-deprecated monastic endeavor...  Although, reading the wikipedia page on scholasticism suggests that I may have an outdated concept of what scholasticism is.  I remember being taught that it was a method of learning based entirely on accumulating and studying texts.  I was thinking in calling myself a scholastic to refer to the fact that my primary qualification seems to be my reading rate.

Which is not ideal.  I wish I read faster.  I know some people do!  Nor do I even read as fast as I did at my peak reading rate.  Ah, to be seven again, competing in a several-month reading competition!  What a bitter second place that was!  How memorable, how shocking, to discover that someone could read faster than *me*.

Do people ever do reading competitions in adulthood?  Can I ever find a group where I can try that again with different peers?  I dug up a site that does reading comprehension tests... on a limited library...  It wasn't good enough.

What I'm trying to say is that I'm pretty dependent on analyzing what other people write.  I've built or grown few things in my life, but I've existed in the life of the mind.  Ultimately I think the endstate of society exists wholly in the life of the mind, and I long for a virtual paradise where all is thought and thought is all.

Something I've been thinking about lately is "the reciprocal development of the will", which I believe expresses an ethical ideal.  Rejecting the maximal development of any particular will, the principle of the reciprocal will is the love of liberation.  As one person would not like to be restrained, they should not like others to be restrained that way.  As one person would not like to be afflicted, they should not like others to be afflicted that way.  Thus the reciprocal development of the will is a concept that militates against severe inequalities in society and especially the continuation of suffering,

The exploration of the will is what I consider essential and eternal in society.  It is the driver of [[yggdrasil]].  When all is virtual, only the will remains.  Such virtual worlds can contain all other worlds in theory, but if they are not implemented with the respect of reciprocity, they enable the evillest possible act: involuntary simulation.  If it is considered ethical for one will to overwrite other wills, society has no principle by which Yggdrasil rises without injustice.  The reciprocal development of the will attempts to spread across society a system of good boundaries which will ultimately be key to establishing a virtual society that maximizes rather than impairs freedom.

To defend the reciprocal development of the will is a project that should be started far in advance of planting Yggdrasil's roots.

I'm interested in this as a potential morphology trick.  I think electrical modification of cells may be useful to change cell growth patterns.
