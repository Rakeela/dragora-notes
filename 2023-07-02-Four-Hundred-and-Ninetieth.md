06:29.  I got up very nearly to 06:00 and it surprises me that half an hour has passed already.

07:39.  Almost done with morning stuff.

07:44.  43,830.

08:15.  44,153.  I ate a packet of instant ramen for breakfast.  That was part of my first half hour, I think, or else it was soon after.  Somewhere in the proximity of that time point.  Ramen is delicious and makes me happy, yet it doesn't inspire the neurotic hunger that I'm familiar with.  That doesn't mean I'm not hungry.  I just faced down a temptation to eat some chocolate (I resisted) and then a temptation to cook some beans (I resisted).  The beans would be twice as many calories as the chocolate, but I think I'm going to end up eating those today.  Later.

08:57.  44,679.  I just thought to myself, "I'm hungry again, and I just noted down when I ate that packet of ramen.  Maybe I am suffering neutoric hunger."  Then I discovered it's been almost 45 minutes since I noted down the thing about the ramen.  Writing has been going okay.

09:15.  44,695.  Okay, I'm uninspired.  Hungry, too.

10:26.  45,582.  3,555 words on the chapter.

11:24.  45,809.  

11:42.  46,007.  3,980 words on the chapter.  2,177 words of progress.

13:02.  I went out for a bit after my last time point.  I went out to Trader Joes and I bought a tuna salad wrap, then I went to Half Price Books and looked at spirituality books without buying anything.  I stopped by a donut shop and bought two overpriced donuts, then paid too large a tip.  Very unsatisfying.  The donuts were good, but food is such a temporary pleasure.  There and then gone.  Why does it have such a hold on me?

13:36.  20 Peeps!  I ate 20 Peeps!

23:27.  46,008.  2,178 words of progress.  I don't remember what I changed, but I checked my tally again and there's an additional word in there somewhere.

23:34.  One thing I have to remind myself of is that the authorities in Ormeri don't have to be RIGHT.  They could be very, painfully wrong.  The flaws in their mindset are part of the story.

23:47.  11.0 miles.  1,633 kcal.  32,754 steps.  5 hours, 58 minutes, 21 seconds.  Average speed 1.8 mph.
