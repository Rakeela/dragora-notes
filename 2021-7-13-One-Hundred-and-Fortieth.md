I injured my feet recently.  I thought I'd injured both Achilles' tendons, based on where it hurt yesterday.  Today I think I injured my right Achilles' tendon, and my left... mid-foot.  There's a band of inflexible ouch across the middle of my left foot.  I can walk, but I can't walk fast.  And the back of my right foot burns even when I'm not putting weight on it.

So I've been reading about plant mitochondria.  This suggests that the research I want to do is not as novel as I'd hoped:
https://www.pnas.org/content/113/12/3395 (Csanad Gurdon, Zora Svab, Yaping Feng, Dibyendu Kumar, and Pal Maliga.  (2016, March 22.)  Cell-to-cell movement of mitochondria in plants.  *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*.  Retrieved 2021-7-13.)

Transfection of whole mitochondria in mature plants is not fundamentally novel of itself.  That's the bad news.  The good news is, that means there's already been some research in how to achieve it.  Since my [[Chives-of-Wrath]] are a commercial bring-it-to-market objective rather than a prestige-based get-there-first objective, this means I can use someone else's techniques.

Based on reading this, I now think that I should use a kind of nonviable shaved-graft technique to transfer mitochondria between plants.  By taking superficial tissue from the donor plant, shaving a matching section of the recipient plant, and affixing the donor tissue, I now believe that mitochondria transfection will occur between the cells.  The resulting 'alloplasmic' recipient plant may be sterile, but it should experience recombination of the plant mitochondria without disruption of nuclear genomes, as is my experimental objective to achieve.

I think I should be able to use this as a research basis to generate cultivars with which to test my hypothesis that mitochondria have specific metabolic traits of potential value in generating new crop strains.  My eventual objective will be the aforementioned 'chives of wrath', intended to be an edible weed with an exaggeratedly fast growing rate, though more immediately I would like to create a tropical chive.  For this I need a suitable tropical species to serve as the mitochondrial donor...  I have yet to select one.

Oh, I also picked up a new search direction.  If the research cited previously in this blog post is accurate, 'alloplasmic' plants should all have recombinant mitochondria, and research on alloplasmic plants is (potentially unwittingly) research into the traits of cultivars with variant mitochondria.

For instance, this:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942274/ (corresponding author Andrzej K Noyszewski, corresponding author Farhad Ghavami, Loai M Alnemer, Ali Soltani, Yong Q Gu, Naxin Huo, Steven Meinhardt, Penny MA Kianian, and corresponding author Shahryar F Kianian.  (Jan 25, 2014.)  Accelerated evolution of the mitochondrial genome in an alloplasmic line of durum wheat.  *BMC Genomics*.  Retrieved 2021-7-13.)

This research from 2014 attributes to speculative evolutionary mechanisms under alloplasmic conditions what the 2016 paper above suggests are more specifically attributable to plant mitochondrial recombination under alloplasmic conditions.  To its credit, the possibility of mitochondria recombination is here mentioned specifically.  This paper is of particular importance to me as it mentions substoichiometric shifting, something with which I have not previously been acquainted, which may be relevant to my efforts to create new cultivars with different dominant mitochondria.
