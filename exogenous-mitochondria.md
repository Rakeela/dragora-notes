# Exogenous Mitochondria

It's possible to add [[mitochondria]] to the body.  Cells seem to uptake free-floating mitochondria from the extracellular medium, and to incorporate such acquired mitochondria readily into their metabolism.  This opens up the possibility of using mitochondria as a treatment tool.

I suspect that it would be helpful if hospitals kept supplies of transfusable exogenous mitochondria on hand for treating emergencies related to [[ischemic-tissues]].  To this end, I would like to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial cultivation as a source of large quantities of intact transfusable mitochondria.  This is the first of my [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]].
