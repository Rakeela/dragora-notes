# Exogenous Mitochondria

It's possible to add [[mitochondria]] to the body.  Cells seem to uptake free-floating mitochondria from the extracellular medium, and to incorporate such acquired mitochondria readily into their metabolism.  This opens up the possibility of using mitochondria as a treatment tool.

I suspect that it would be helpful if hospitals kept supplies of transfusable exogenous mitochondria on hand for treating emergencies related to [[ischemic-tissues]].  To this end, I would like to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial cultivation as a source of large quantities of intact transfusable mitochondria.  This is the first of my [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]].

Blue sky concepts:
I wonder if exogenous mitochondria could be used preparatively to prevent injury from stroke; I've added an entry to [[imagine-a-brain-implant]] with this concept.
Could cultivated specific mitochondria be utilized as a protective adjunct to chemotherapy, by cultivating mitochondria with salient resistances and then pushing them to vital cells so that they will better resist the toxins being used against the cancerous cells?
Could intentionally damaged mitochondria be utilized as a form of chemotherapy, inducing apoptotic processes in cells that uptake them?
Can metabolism be accelerated through establishing conditions for preferential xenomitochondria in multicellular lifeforms?  This could have applications in agriculture, healthcare, and athletic doping, in declining order of salience; this is an unscientific judgment as it is founded on an intuition that plants are most likely to gain from xenomitochondria evolved under different conditions.  More scientifically, it would be easiest to test early xenomitochondria on simple plantlife.  The concept here is, can a multicellular lifeform be induced to change its mitochondrial balance through treatment early in life, thereafter maintaining its new mitochondria population of its own?  If this can be done, can adjusting the mitochondrial DNA through mitochondria sourced from other species (xenomitochondria) achieve therapeutic outcomes beneficial to the recipient species?
If exogenous mitochondria could be delivered alongside necessary medical injuries (injections, incisions), they may reduce unnecessary cellular injuries in the region through supporting the resilience of cells proximate to the site of injury.  The feasibility of this depends on the productive potential of mitochondrial growth acceleration, and on the ease of delivery attainable for the mitochondria.
Can a transport serum be devised to move mitochondria around outside of the body?  How necessary is it?  How resilient are mitochondria?  If I succeed at reproducing mitochondrial lines, I may be able to perform wastage experiments in which the deterioration of mitochondrial populations is observed under varying conditions to better identify preservation requirements.  Could I also selectively breed for highly transportable transfusable xenomitochondria populations?
