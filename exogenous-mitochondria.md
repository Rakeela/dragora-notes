# Exogenous Mitochondria

It's possible to add [[mitochondria]] to the body.  Cells seem to uptake free-floating mitochondria from the extracellular medium, and to incorporate such acquired mitochondria readily into their metabolism.  This opens up the possibility of using mitochondria as a treatment tool.

I suspect that it would be helpful if hospitals kept supplies of transfusable exogenous mitochondria on hand for treating emergencies related to [[ischemic-tissues]].  To this end, I would like to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial cultivation as a source of large quantities of intact transfusable mitochondria.  This is the first of my [[mitochondrial-experimental-proposals]].

Blue sky concepts:
I wonder if exogenous mitochondria could be used preparatively to prevent injury from stroke; I've added an entry to [[imagine-a-brain-implant]] with this concept.
Could cultivated specific mitochondria be utilized as a protective adjunct to chemotherapy, by cultivating mitochondria with salient resistances and then pushing them to vital cells so that they will better resist the toxins being used against the cancerous cells?
Could intentionally damaged mitochondria be utilized as a form of chemotherapy, inducing apoptotic processes in cells that uptake them?
