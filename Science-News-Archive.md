This is for unsorted links to science news with headlines, potentially also with commentary.  I'm not committing to this yet, but my track record of starting stuff and then maintaining interest in it has been unexpectedly good in this form-factor.

The link behavior busted again.  I wonder why.  I'm deeply annoyed that this program discloses my name in these files in that way, but if anyone somehow wanted to force my name through like this, the fact that I'm publishing this under my own name on GitHub makes this *super* petty.
