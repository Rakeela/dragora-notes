With my first novel published, I've returned to my third manuscript, Ekis' Travelogue.  71,612 words at present.

71,988 words on the file.  I feel like I'm striking a rock wall with a pickaxe.  Two hours of work later, this just isn't flowing.

72,212 words on the file.  Three hours of work.  It's progressing.  I just hit a point in the story which feels like a chapter break, but I'm only 1,300 words (or so) into the current chapter.  The chapter shouldn't end before 2k.

(This part added the next day.)  I wrote 600 words in all yesterday.  Sigh.  200 words an hour isn't very good.
