14:37.  I've been tired and pained all day so far today, and I haven't felt like writing.  I woke up paralyzed and struggled to get my mobility up enough to move.  I spent like 11 minutes in pain and limited mobility before I managed to get up, not counting time I spent before that drifting in and out of sleep because I couldn't get up.\

15:32.  1,837 words of editing.  106,676.  106,788.  112 words of writing.

19:39.  I got absorbed in a TTRPG thing around the time of the prior timepoint.
