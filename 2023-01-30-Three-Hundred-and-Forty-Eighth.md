252.2 pounds on the scale.  I seem to always wake up weighing less than I did before I slept.

Lunchtime.  I broke my fast with a pair of pastries, obliterating all idea of carbohydrate restriction and probably overflowing my calorie target.  Oh well.  I won't eat anything else today.  I ate a blood orange cruffin - something completely new to me - and a gluten free peppermint cookie of the most delicious kind I have ever had.  I waited all year for the cafe that sells those to have them back in stock again!

I've got a new treadmill!  It's snazzier than my old one, but also harder to lubricate and inconveniently larger.

I've added a bit of rum to my diet soda.  It tastes terrible and ruins the flavor of what I'm drinking.  This serves the purpose of slowing down my fluid consumption...  I was going through today's soda bottle awfully quickly.

2689 words on the file.  4,576 on the file.  1,887 words of progress.  I feel like I should've done more.

Evening weight:  251.4 pounds.  I guess my lunch of pastries didn't stop my weight from declining today.
