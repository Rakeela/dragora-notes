We're still doing boilerplate intro-to-class stuff, but this class activity handout is making me nervous.  The syllabus suggests that a first chapter assignment is already present in week 1 and this handout suggests that it's about the first chapter assignment.  Do I really fill this out in class?  When in class do I start filling this out..?

Organic chemistry is given as the study of carbon.  Organic compounds always contain carbon and hydrogen.  They may also contain other nonmetals such as O, S, N, P, or a halogen.

Organic compounds are found in common products such as gasoline, medicine, shampoo, plastic, and perfume.  (Commentary:  I'm copying off a slide in this post, this isn't very insightful.)

Organic compounds are organized by their functional groups, which are groups of atoms bonded in a specific way.  Compounds that contain the same functional group have similar physical and chemical properties.

Organic compounds typically have covalent bonds.  Their melting and boiling points are typically low.  They are typically flammable and undergo combustion.  They are typically not soluble in water.

Inorganic compounds typically have high melting and boiling points.  Ionic inorganic compounds are usually soluble in water, and most do not burn in air.

Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen.  Carbon has four valence electrons and hydrogen has one.  To achieve an octet, carbon forms four bonds.  CH4, a very simple hydrocarbon, is termed Methane.

(Skip: card explaining condensed and expanded molecular formulas.  I got this, and I got distracted reading about acetylene on wikipedia.)

In methane (CH4), carbon forms four covalent bonds to hydrogen.  According to VSEPR theory, Methane is tetrahedral and has bond angles of 109 degrees.  Three models are shown:  Space-filling model (described as realistic), Ball-and-stick model (preferred as it shows the bond with sticks), wedge-dash model (draws the shape in two dimensions).

A hydrocarbon is referred to as a saturated hydrocarbon when all the bonds in the molecule are single bonds.  They're saturated because the carbon has as many atoms bonded to it as it can have.

In ethane (C2H6), each tetrahedral carbon forms three covalent bonds to hydrogen and one to the other carbon.  (Commentary:  This was used to show off expanded and condensed molecular formulas.  The teacher said that students sometimes draw the wrong one on assignments, and requested that we avoid that error.)

(Commentary:  The teacher has twice now emphasized that we are not likely to be asked to draw wedge-dash models.  She seems to disfavor them.)

(Commentary:  Class is now over time.  The lecture is running long.)

Butane (C4H10) is another tetrahedral molecule.  Having four single covalent bonds yields a tetrahedral shape.

(Commentary:  Time set aside for the class activity, but since I was nervous about it I already finished it early.)
