We're still doing boilerplate intro-to-class stuff, but this class activity handout is making me nervous.  The syllabus suggests that a first chapter assignment is already present in week 1 and this handout suggests that it's about the first chapter assignment.  Do I really fill this out in class?  When in class do I start filling this out..?
