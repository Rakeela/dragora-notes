Humanity today has a consensus against the rectitude of torture.  It is now considered to be unjust in response to all crimes, including the crime of torturing others.  It must be remembered however that this is a reversal from historic standards.  Humanity once had a consensus that torture was an appropriate response to many crimes and wholly beyond reproach when applied to a torturer.

I mention this to establish a point: consensus alone cannot safeguard justice.  We can look back at history and see examples wherein nearly all people agreed about things we now consider horrific.

This isn't apropos of anything in particular.  I just think about this stuff.
