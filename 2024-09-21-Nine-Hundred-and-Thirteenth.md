10:31.  Bleh.  I had a lot of trouble getting up this morning.

10:36.  51,503.

11:37.  51,701.  Not a great hour of productivity.

12:34.  52,060.  Geez.  This is so slow.

19:05.  52,705.  I didn't work consistently!  I worked until 15:30 and then have only just gotten back to it.  So at 15:30, I had 52,705 words on the file.

20:09.  53,713.

20:18.  53,838.  I know I haven't exactly put in the hours today, but I need to take a break to seek inspiration.  Is it really a break?  It's not putting wordcount down.  2,335 words of progress.

20:53.  I have a potential inspiration, but wow it's late.  I'm not convinced to keep writing yet.  I'm going to go for a walk.
