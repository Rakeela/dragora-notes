If I've correctly read and interpreted the Canvas webpages today, we'll be reviewing functions.  This is another basic lesson.  I was sorely tempted to skip today, but I'm not comfortable with skipping classes intentionally.  I even took a seat far forward in the classroom so I would be better able to read the whiteboard and hear the voice of the professor.

The length of a line between two points can be calculated by counting the horizontal distance between them and the vertical distance between them, then treating these as the two sides opposite the hypotenuse of a triangle.  A^2+B^2=C^2.  This is the origin of the distance formula.

(-9,-5),(x,-13) distance 10
10=squoot((-9x-x)^2+(-5-(-13))^2)
100=(-9-x)^2+64
36=(-9-x)^2
36=81+18x+x^2
0=x^2+18x+45
0=(x+15)(x+3)
x=-15,-3

Step-by-step calculation for dealing with a variable point.

The downside of sitting near the front of the class is that I can't use my phone to deal with how I feel about this class.  I know I'll understand all of this well enough when I get to the practice problems, but right now I just feel distracted confusion about it.  The teacher is trying to explain something called a difference quotient, which is the slope of a secant line?  This is the only way I can think of to take notes on it.

Underneath the secant line is the line h, bounded by the points x and x+h.  The defining points of the secant line are (x,f(x)) and (x+h,f(x+h)).

f(x)=2x^2-1
DQ=(f(x+h)-f)x))/h
DQ=(2(x+h)^2-1-(2x^2-1))/h
DQ=(2(x^2+2xh+h^2)-1-(2x^2-1))/h
DQ=(4xh+2h^2)/h <- /\ This should've been more than one step, IMO.
DQ=4x+2h

f(x)=squoot(1-x)
DQ=(f(x+h)-f(x))/h
DQ=(squoot(1-(x+h))-squoot(1-x))/h
DQ=((squoot(1-x-h)-squoot(1-x))/h)((squoot(1-x-h)+squoot(1-x))/(squoot1-x-h)+squoot(1-x)) <-- This is technically a multiplication by 1.
DQ=((squoot(1-x-h))^2-(squoot(1-x))^2)/(h(squoot(1-x-h)+squoot(1-x)))
DQ=(1-x-h-(1-x))/h(squoot(1-x-h)+squoot(1-x))
DQ=-h/h(squoot(1-x-h)+(squoot1-x))
DQ=-1/(squoot(1-x-h)+(1-x))
DQ=-1 <--  I copied it off the board.  I don't get it.

I don't like this teacher's anecdotes.  Please don't tell me about a Desperate Housewives plot you watched back when you lived in Mexico.

This guy works through these problems quickly and I don't feel like I'm getting anything from it.  I'm having to suppress the urge to yawn, and it's kind of frustrating that yawning is symptomatic of boredom or sleepiness, because I'm definitely not bored or sleepy.  I'm overwhelmed and I don't feel like I'm getting anything out of this session.  I feel like I should be ignoring the lecture and doing the math problems on the homework.  I've got the e-text open, too.  That seems more useful than seeing this guy show off that he can manipulate math problems rapidly.  I'm going to have to talk to the disability center and make sure I get extra time on this guy's tests.
