For like the last month now, I've been suffering a problem every time I get under 240 pounds.  I immediately get way hungrier!  Yesterday I got under 240 pounds and it was unbearable.  Today I'm starting out under 240 pounds and it's still unbearable.  Obviously, I'm bearing it so far...  I still have 120 hours to go on my fast.

Kistaro says I'm suffering a "psychological barrier" and that breaking through it will make it reset 10 pounds lower, so that I'll start suffering once I get under 230 instead.  It's true I stabilized a few pounds over 240 for a while, and stabilizing a few pounds over 230 for a while will still be progress.  It's also true that it kind of has to be psychological.  What else could it be?

I'm going to institute a [[Candy-Vault]] for tracking my candy supply.  I'll record all inventory as well as subtractions for one month.  I hope this will inhibit binging by requiring me to accurately record my binges.  I still expect to binge; I simply hope to binge less.  I also hope to preserve some of my candy from fast to fast.
