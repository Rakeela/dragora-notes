So I've tried hot cocoa with some orange flavoring.  Milk chocolate cocoa and orange flavoring didn't really work.  Dark chocolate cocoa and orange flavoring was like drinking a chocolate orange again - a signal that I look for.

I still think Black Rose Beverages could work.  This COULD be a flagship flavor.  I think I need to retake my business courses when I get back to school... in the spring.

If only I could study without constant scrutiny by rights-violating creeps who hate me for reasons they won't express or reconsider!  I stopped putting out cybersexually and BAM, I was a sexually predatory bigot forever.  As soon as I exercised my right to disconnect from people, they crushed my reputation in ways that I have no right to "dishonestly" seek to repair by such things as my lifelong liberalism.
