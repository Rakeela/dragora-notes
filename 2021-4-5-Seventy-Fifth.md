#2021-4-5-Seventy-Fifth

The entries in my [[character-gallery]] are dominated by female characters so far.  I could include Issandar, as a male character that I'm very attached to as well; I expect that I will eventually.  Yet Issandar might exemplify *why* the characters on the list are mostly female.  I can't handle the "all men are sluts" energy that I've seen no end of in life.  I've never been able to.

Issandar was made in an attempt to create a male character who would be honestly happy with that energy.  He's very definitely a male slut, just like modern men are supposed to be, so I don't want to include him as the first male on the list.  Men aren't supposed to have motives which don't trace directly to their sex drives.  Well, Issandar doesn't.

I was male as Rakeela; I was male as Kairn.  That meant something different in those worlds.  Men on Earth aren't supposed to have motives which don't trace directly or indirectly to their sex drives.  Claiming to want things for reasons other than sex is treated as being as improbable as claiming to be Jesus or Ghandi.  That level of sexual objectification is dehumanizing.

As an otherkin, I'd like to have a better word than 'dehumanizing' for that, but I'll use the word I've got.
