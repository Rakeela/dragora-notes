#2021-4-5-Seventy-Fifth

The entries in my [[character-gallery]] are dominated by female characters so far.  I could include Issandar, as a male character that I'm very attached to as well; I expect that I will eventually.  Yet Issandar might exemplify *why* the characters on the list are mostly female.  I can't handle the "all men are sluts" energy that I've seen no end of in life.  I've never been able to.

Issandar was made in an attempt to create a male character who would be honestly happy with that energy.  He's very definitely a male slut, just like modern men are supposed to be, so I don't want to include him as the first male on the list.

I was male as Rakeela; I was male as Kairn.  That meant something different in those worlds.
