The entries in my [[character-gallery]] are dominated by female characters so far.  I could include Issandar, as a male character that I'm very attached to as well; I expect that I will eventually.  Yet Issandar might exemplify *why* the characters on the list are mostly female.  I can't handle the "all men are sluts" energy that I've seen no end of in life.  I've never been able to.

Issandar was made in an attempt to create a male character who would be honestly happy with that energy.  He's very definitely a male slut, just like modern men are supposed to be, so I don't want to include him as the first male on the list.  Men aren't supposed to have motives which don't trace directly to their sex drives.  Well, Issandar doesn't.

I was male as Rakeela; I was male as Kairn.  That meant something different in those worlds.  Men on Earth aren't supposed to have motives which don't trace directly or indirectly to their sex drives.  Claiming to want things for reasons other than sex is treated as being as improbable as claiming to be Jesus or Ghandi.  That level of sexual objectification is dehumanizing.

As an otherkin, I'd like to have a better word than 'dehumanizing' for that, but I'll use the word I've got.  If human women were subject to the same all-must-be-sexual pressure and were treated as lying when they claimed nonsexual motives the way men are treated as lying when they claim nonsexual motive, human women would be horribly traumatized by that treatment.  As a society, we KNOW that is true!  Acknowledging the same thing about men is considered unacceptable.  Well, human psychology is ungendered in enough ways that I think a lot of men on Earth must be walking around with unacknowledged trauma burdens as a side effect of living in this society.

My awareness of that makes it hard to come up with male characters for my writing.  Trying to conform with obligatory male hypersexuality certainly traumatized me.
