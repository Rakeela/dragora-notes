23:39.  So today was not a writing day, but Kistaro's parents visited and we went to the Museum of Flight together.  I also sold a copy of The Tachanigh-Kelkaith to Kistaro's mom.  Yay.  My income is way up this year... relative to most years... and I still won't earn enough to pay taxes on it, not at this rate.
