12:07.

13:26.  We're starting at 11,800 today.  I started at my earlier time point, but I got distracted and didn't mark my starting point correctly.

14:40.  12,200.  Damn, this is going slowly.

15:45.  13,232.  1,432 words of progress.  Gotta go farther to hit my quota for the day.

16:09.  13,311.  1,511.  Still need more.  I'm stuck at a chapter opening.  That's where I usually get stuck.

19:02.  14,293.  2,493 words of progress.

19:12.  14,305.  2,505 words of progress.

21:04.  15,104.  3,304 words of progress.

22:40.  15,218.  Since my last time point, I also showered, sat around, watched a few minutes of an anime, scrolled around on social media, etc.

23:41.  I'm having trouble being done with the day.  I've been reading a book for the last hour, and I'm really enjoying it, but it's too late to be up.  I need to go to bed.

23:42.  11.2 miles.  1,960 kcal.  40,963 steps.  8 hours, 41 minutes, and 44 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.
