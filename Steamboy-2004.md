I liked this one!  I've forgotten it pretty thoroughly.  Maybe I should watch it again sometime.

Finally got to rewatch this one.  Once again, I truly had forgotten it.  Some things were familiar, like the steam-bike contraption.  Other things were unfamiliar, the whole launching-the-Steam-Castle thing took me by surprise.

Steamboy seems like a movie with a high off-screen body count.  All the people who should've died due to the stuff that happens on-screen!

The juxtaposition of this movie with Howl's Moving Castle was kind of poor for it.  Howl's Moving Castle was truly amazing.  This was merely good.
