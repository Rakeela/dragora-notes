# Algae Farming for Soil Quality

Subtopic of [[geo-engineering]]

Algae is a famously *un*desirable food.  There's a lot of interest in using it as a biochemical and mechanical feedstock for energetic inputs to systems, due to the ability of alge to grow enthusiastically in conditions unfavorable for other forms of agriculture, but it's not easily added to anyone's diet.  (Note that seaweed is algae, so seaweed aquaculture is also a form of algae farming.)  Despite this fact, algae has a lot of uses as various forms of feedstock where its presence isn't noticed.  Chemical processing to the rescue; get far enough from bugs and people will applaud their inclusion.

One thing that's already done is to process algae into fertilizer.  I think this should be scaled up in the name of ecological management.  Algae is cheap among the industrial inputs, and it seems to me that if you wanted to purpose-grow an input for the process of transferring nutrients into barren areas, algae would be a good scalable candidate with many alternative uses by which to ensure that increased output would not go to waste should the soil quality management program gets trimmed, obsoleted, or outcompeted for necessary resources.  Renovating barren areas of the world increases the ability of the planetary ecology to sink carbon and maintain a healthy water cycle.  The most important cloud cover for cooling the planet is the cloudcover that forms nearest the surface; if we can do better than misty forests for shielding the planet from excess heat, I do not know about it.  Then, we should be pursuing the expansion of forest cover, and one way to expand forest cover without displacing human habitation is to pursue reforestation of presently barren regions.
