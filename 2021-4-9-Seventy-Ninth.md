I have just received in the post a book that I ordered, "Monster Girl Encyclopedia".  Doesn't it stand out, that this is supposed to be all men want?  It's a product of our era.

I once started studying this kind of thing in grim obligation; it was work.  I feel no shame, for I was trying to bring forth Mel's paradise.  Sex-positivity via sexual media!  I don't think it was a good idea, but I also don't think it was a hopeless idea.  Sexual media just needs to find a way to have more gravitas and not be repulsively anti-sexual by making all things sexual look grotesque and unfun.  Intuitively enough, I think that actually being positive about sex would've made sex-positivity more successful!

This book...  I don't think it does it.  The way it talks about 'monster and husband', the way it fixates on reproduction...  It's just like a great swathe of depressing ugly sex-negative materials had been.  It's just another work that sexually objectifies men, treating them as wanting nothing but sex...  well, it *is* about monsters.  I never wanted to ban any of this stuff.  I was just depressed about being treated as an object who could be coerced into producing it.

Sex-positivity needed to teach people affection, the way [[the-ethical-slut]] does when it talks about subjects like dating, cuddling, and the general importance of forming constellations of stable relationships.  To really be liberating sex-positivity needed to be willing to recognize natalistic works as being works about frank molestation.  A sex-positivity like that would have recognized Ihroun and Marchosias as having dramatic stories which could be about necessary healing... well, I think that wouldn't have served Marchosias' story as well, but she was a demon!  It was the story that Ihroun needed and will still someday get if I can author it.

Instead we had an emotionally incompetent sex-positivity that forebade the formation of better, more complete relationships, or at least that's what I ran into and got exploited by.
