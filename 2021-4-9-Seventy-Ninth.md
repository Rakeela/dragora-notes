I have just received in the post a book that I ordered, "Monster Girl Encyclopedia Volume 1".  Doesn't it stand out, that this is supposed to be all men want?  It's a product of our era.

I once started studying this kind of thing in grim obligation; it was work.  I feel no shame, for I was trying to bring forth Mel's paradise.  Sex-positivity via sexual media!  I don't think it was a good idea, but I also don't think it was a hopeless idea.  Sexual media just needs to find a way to have more gravitas and not be repulsively anti-sexual by making all things sexual look grotesque and unfun.  Intuitively enough, I think that actually being positive about sex would've made sex-positivity more successful!

This book...  I don't think it does it.  The way it talks about 'monster and husband', the way it fixates on reproduction...  It's just like a great swathe of depressing ugly sex-negative materials had been.  It's just another work that sexually objectifies men, treating them as wanting nothing but sex...  well, it *is* about monsters.  I never wanted to ban any of this stuff.  I was just depressed about being treated as an object who could be coerced into producing it.

Sex-positivity needed to teach people affection, the way [[the-ethical-slut]] does when it talks about subjects like dating, cuddling, and the general importance of forming constellations of stable relationships.  To really be liberating sex-positivity needed to be willing to recognize natalistic works as being works about frank molestation.  A sex-positivity like that would have recognized Ihroun and Marchosias as having dramatic stories which could be about necessary healing... well, I think that wouldn't have served Marchosias' story as well, but she was a demon!  It was the story that Ihroun needed and will still someday get if I can author it.

Instead we had an emotionally incompetent sex-positivity that forebade the formation of better, more complete relationships, or at least that's what I ran into and got exploited by.

I feel like I'm vampirizing this book, hehe.  Something I've noticed that I "shouldn't" mention, as it is too much of a psychic influence...  Many texts have a 'vibe' that I pick up on.  This sets in more rapidly than makes sense; it's almost like touching the book and learning something about it.

Well, this book?  I feel like I'm draining its psychic energy for my own usage, hah!

It has the same vibe as "The Survivor's Guide to Sex" by Staci Haines... and maybe *less* so.  That energy was actually kind of upsetting with Staci Haines' book, which doesn't do as well as The Ethical Slut at talking about society and how to build trust between people, and so didn't meet my needs.  (The Ethical Slut is going to be a classic!)  The same energy is not as upsetting with "Monster Girl Encyclopedia Volume 1", because here it's more like the book being the product I paid for...  I didn't have any particularly elevated expectations.

The Monster Girl Encyclopedia is almost just rape, rape, rape, rape, and rape.  It's astonishing in its consistency.  This is such a forceful and unpleasant take on sexuality.  I'm like 2/5ths into the book and my first impression is holding up pretty well overall.

Yet something else stood out to me as well, which I didn't expect going in: the author fixates on loyalty!  The vast majority of the monster girls are described as wanting to have a PERFECT SINGLE RELATIONSHIP FOREVER, as well as being described as basically falling in love with any cock immediately and forever.  It reminds me of something I've read about where too many guys supposedly equivocate sex and love, and they get this "loyal" fixation on anyone they have sex with even if that makes no sense...  I get the feeling that the text is turning that around and ramping it out to eleven to make something horrific out of it.

I wonder how many people read the book and picked up on that.  I complain about the way society treats men, but I'm also well aware that there are valid complaints out there.

Also, the level of semen fixation in some pages of this book makes sense of some of the slug-whore jokes I've seen people make.  Those annoyed me so much before!  This must be the kind of thing where that comes from.  Essence, essence, and more "essence"!  Heh.

I've written with the same kind of bad joke before, but I was still annoyed by other people making it.  I was always treated as the butt of the joke, even when I was the one authoring it, even when I was being sexually coerced.  Even though I was rebuked harshly for complaining about anything in particular, the idea that I was present unwillingly and dealing with stuff I didn't like was treated as 100% unfathomable.  The reason I had to be rebuked for complaining was because I had a lot to complain about...  Being treated as the deserving target for a rape culture that molested me for years and stalked me vengefully when I started saying no really wore off my sense of humor for jokes about semen.

I had to do the same kind of all-positive writing that this book uses.  Pleasure, pleasure, and "pleasure" forever...  Reading it, on some of these descriptions of extreme marathon sex, I've just found myself thinking, "but the chafing and soreness"...  I mean, I've been there.  It's just so virgin fantasy.  People who've never had their genitals chafe from overuse are probably more inclined to mistake this book for presenting a perspective on... actual pleasure.

"Dark elves kick and whip not pain but pleasure into their men, a skill they've honed over many years."  I mean, I think masochism is an actual fetish that a lot of people don't have.  I don't like Earth very much, but I'm pretty sure I'd turn down a portal to the world in *this* book.

I'm tempted to file this work in 'comedy' and think of it as redeeming some of the bad jokes I faced... although actually, I think those bad jokes are still kind of a buzzkill...  It's unfun to think about how people who read this book are in danger of being the butt of the joke.  Abusers don't decide who the butt of the joke is by whether people *actually* don't get it, but by whether they can get away with victimizing someone by portraying them as not getting it, like what happened to me...

The rape-aligned types who victimize anyone who is too honest in sexuality make it dangerous to express anything positive OR negative about anything sexual, and I can only imagine them victimizing people who picked up anything in this book and expressed anything good or bad about it.  Complaints are "authoritarian" and "unfun" so people who complain about sex are targeted for victimization; praises are "virgin fantasy" and "lame" so people who actually like sex are targeted for victimization.  The result is a deathly opacity where the whole subject is basically taboo... and what is a society where sex is too dangerous to talk about, if not a conservative society?

I would turn down a portal to the world in *this* book, but society on Earth is still awful.
