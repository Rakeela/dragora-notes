I have just received in the post a book that I ordered, "Monster Girl Encyclopedia Volume 1".  Doesn't it stand out, that this is supposed to be all men want?  It's a product of our era.

I once started studying this kind of thing in grim obligation; it was work.  I feel no shame, for I was trying to bring forth Mel's paradise.  Sex-positivity via sexual media!  I don't think it was a good idea, but I also don't think it was a hopeless idea.  Sexual media just needs to find a way to have more gravitas and not be repulsively anti-sexual by making all things sexual look grotesque and unfun.  Intuitively enough, I think that actually being positive about sex would've made sex-positivity more successful!

This book...  I don't think it does it.  The way it talks about 'monster and husband', the way it fixates on reproduction...  It's just like a great swathe of depressing ugly sex-negative materials had been.  It's just another work that sexually objectifies men, treating them as wanting nothing but sex...  well, it *is* about monsters.  I never wanted to ban any of this stuff.  I was just depressed about being treated as an object who could be coerced into producing it.

Sex-positivity needed to teach people affection, the way [[the-ethical-slut]] does when it talks about subjects like dating, cuddling, and the general importance of forming constellations of stable relationships.  To really be liberating sex-positivity needed to be willing to recognize natalistic works as being works about frank molestation.  A sex-positivity like that would have recognized Ihroun and Marchosias as having dramatic stories which could be about necessary healing... well, I think that wouldn't have served Marchosias' story as well, but she was a demon!  It was the story that Ihroun needed and will still someday get if I can author it.

Instead we had an emotionally incompetent sex-positivity that forebade the formation of better, more complete relationships, or at least that's what I ran into and got exploited by.

I feel like I'm vampirizing this book, hehe.  Something I've noticed that I "shouldn't" mention, as it is too much of a psychic influence...  Many texts have a 'vibe' that I pick up on.  This sets in more rapidly than makes sense; it's almost like touching the book and learning something about it.

Well, this book?  I feel like I'm draining its psychic energy for my own usage, hah!

It has the same vibe as "The Survivor's Guide to Sex" by Staci Haines... and maybe *less* so.  That energy was actually kind of upsetting with Staci Haines' book, which doesn't do as well as The Ethical Slut at talking about society and how to build trust between people, and so didn't meet my needs.  (The Ethical Slut is going to be a classic!)  The same energy is not as upsetting with "Monster Girl Encyclopedia Volume 1", because here it's more like the book being the product I paid for...  I didn't have any particularly elevated expectations.

The Monster Girl Encyclopedia is almost just rape, rape, rape, rape, and rape.  It's astonishing in its consistency.  This is such a forceful and unpleasant take on sexuality.  I'm like 2/5ths into the book and my first impression is holding up pretty well overall.

Yet something else stood out to me as well, which I didn't expect going in: the author fixates on loyalty!  The vast majority of the monster girls are described as wanting to have a PERFECT SINGLE RELATIONSHIP FOREVER, as well as being described as basically falling in love with any cock immediately and forever.  It reminds me of something I've read about where too many guys supposedly equivocate sex and love, and they get this "loyal" fixation on anyone they have sex with even if that makes no sense...  I get the feeling that the text is turning that around and ramping it out to eleven to make something horrific out of it.

I wonder how many people read the book and picked up on that.  I complain about the way society treats men, but I'm also well aware that there are valid complaints out there.
