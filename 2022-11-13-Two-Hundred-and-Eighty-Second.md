I have a chemistry test tomorrow.  I haven't studied, but hopefully I'll be okay.  I think I understand the material.  I wish I were tested by having to write essays for class.  That'd be fun.  Showing up for exams just feels awful.

Starting with 906 words on the file that I'm working on.

2,134 words.  1,228 words of progress, 439 words to go.

2,956 words.  2,050 words of progress, 383 over quota.  Done?  I'm sorta stalled at this point, but I wonder if I should stop yet.

My real productivity is lower than my word count, because I'm totally pushing for every scrap of wordage that I can come up with, and editing this mess while be a pain.
