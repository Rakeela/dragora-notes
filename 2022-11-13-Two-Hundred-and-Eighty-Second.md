I have a chemistry test tomorrow.  I haven't studied, but hopefully I'll be okay.  I think I understand the material.  I wish I were tested by having to write essays for class.  That'd be fun.  Showing up for exams just feels awful.

Starting with 906 words on the file that I'm working on.

2,134 words.  1,228 words of progress, 439 words to go.

2,956 words.  2,050 words of progress, 383 over quota.  Done?  I'm sorta stalled at this point, but I wonder if I should stop yet.

My real productivity is lower than my word count, because I'm totally pushing for every scrap of wordage that I can come up with, and editing this mess while be a pain.

I just retallied my project, and it's at 29,477 words.  Subtract 4,589 words of pre-existing material, and I have 24,888 words of manuscript written in November.  Almost at the halfway mark.

There's an 8 word discrepancy between my tally and the tally on the nanowrimo webpage.  It's small, yet frustrating.  I'm not sure where it came from.  It's annoying to see that I apparently can't do the arithmetic involved in adding up wordcounts.

I'm writing a bit more on this.  The file is starting at 2,956 words.  I've written to 3,977 words.  That's an additional 1,012 words of progress.
