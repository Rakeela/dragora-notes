13:52.  Sol sinks more than a billion credits a year into providing pushframes for laterals.

15:23.  I've taken care of something intensely medically unpleasant today.  Yay!  And now a doctor will weigh in on something that alarmed me.

15:24.  I have been helplessly stuck on bad ideas.

15:27.  My story idea now involves a trio of warrior owls from TTI.  Attached to Third Eye Solutions by Transcendent Technologies Incorporated, these three blips are a no-questions-permitted mandate from the mother company.  They identify themselves as Heck-One, Heck-Two, and Heck-Three.  One says that their names are unnecessary and that they should be referred to as One, Two, and Three on the comms.  Ermolai will point out that callsigns are more memorable, and Three will say that nicknames are permitted.  One will say they are NOT, and she is to be called ONE.  Two will have been silent to this point, and someone (maybe Runis?) will point this out.  Two will then identify herself as a stealth specialist.

15:33.  There should also be a fourth individual in the detachment from TTI.  A cheetah cog who identifies as "Heck-Four, or Deathblade, or Deeb, whichever you prefer".  Everyone will thereafter call him Deeb.  Deeb is a stealth specialist who can even sneak up on whispers, though he notes, "You should never try that without heavy support in position nearby.  If you aren't ready to kill the whisper, you aren't ready to twiddle your thumbs in its proximity, and trust me, nobody in Sol has ever been ready to kill a whisper solo.  It can't be done."

15:44.  Three will point out that Deeb isn't actually a Heck, and One will say, "That doesn't mean anything to them."  Someone may ask, "Is a Heck an owl?"  And One and Three will both say at once, "No."

15:53.  Then Two will quietly add, "But all the Hecks are owls," and One will hiss at her.  "Secrets!"
