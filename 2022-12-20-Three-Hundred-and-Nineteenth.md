209.5 hours.  126.5 hours remain.  The fraction of time I've already gone through this is steadily exceeding the fraction left to suffer.  8.7 days I have suffered through already.  5.3 days remain of my fast.

I have banana coconut chocolate.  I'm hoping it's very heavy on the banana.  Not so much the coconut.  I also have peppermint cookie milk chocolate truffles.  They say they're "irresistably smooth" and I'm hoping that means the interior of them is a smooth, pepperminty filling rather than something speckled with lumps of undissolvable peppermint cookie bits.  I want the confection to melt in my mouth.

210 hours.  I ate some veggie rolls with imitation crab, trusting that it would be low enough calorie.  I think it was low enough calorie, but looking it up, apparently imitation crab is made of starch.  Starch!  I didn't know that.  This sin against my fast might be miserable.  Oh well, I got through two days of starving while my body was glycogen-busting at the start of my fast.  I can survive a few hours of doing it again while my body runs down the small amount of starch I just ate.  In the meanwhile, I am temporarily very satiated, and it feels wonderful.  I wish I could feel satiated all the time.

214.5 hours.  I thought I'd suffer for eating those rolls earlier, but I've felt basically satiated for hours now.  Maybe fasting is resensitizing my leptin signalling, and the fat I have on my body is then quick to say, "Enough!"  My weight continues to drop.  My fully dressed weight is now 246.0 pounds.

I'm really looking forward to that eggnog on Christmas evening, but I wonder how much of the candy I should actually eat.  Maybe Christmas dinner should be a veggie roll, and maybe I should eat another one tomorrow.

215 hours.  14 days isn't long enough for me to enter physiological starvation.  I've read that it feels different, that the appetite becomes powerfully insistent.  Of course, I've also read that fat people feel like they're starving all the time due to leptin non-response in their brain.  Both can be true.  Of course, now that I've thought about food a bit I'm back in food fixation mode.  121 hours to go.

218 hours.  Tonight is the hardest night I've had since two nights ago.  I feel stressed out.  Nothing seems appealing and the fast seems massively stressful.  I almost gave up.  If I felt sick tonight, I really would give up.  I don't feel sick.  I'm pulling through.
