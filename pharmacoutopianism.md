#pharmacoutopianism

Pharmacoutopianism is the endeavor to achieve better living through chemistry.  Encompassing not just staid medical pharmaceuticals, but also swathes of 'recreational' pharmaceuticals, pharmacoutopians believe that society's biases against chemically augmented experiencing are too restrictive.

Some of my [[imagine-a-brain-implant]] stuff veers towards this, as did my (unwise) experiments a few years ago with nootropics.  The 'science' of pharmacoutopianism is linked conceptually with [[hedonology]], and for instance I think combining a stimulant-promotion program with an exercise-promotion program would be a good example of a hedonological health program with overall salutary effects.

Even though I remained drawn to the concept, I'd forgotten the word 'pharmacoutopianism' until a NationStates issue managed to remind me of it by cracking a joke about parents remaining up to 'speed' with the latest in parenting.  When I started writing this up, I wanted to quote from someone else's writing, as I didn't originate this idea myself.  Unfortunately, the early internet websites that talked about pharmacoutopianism don't seem to be around anymore.  Some of the best stuff on the 90s net is gone!
