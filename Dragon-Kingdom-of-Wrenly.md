#Dragon-Kingdom-of-Wrenly

Didn't take long to read this.  Good to see more dragon-centric writing... even if it does star the pet of a human leader.  Minor plothole in that Ruskin both claims to have befriended the queen of the faeries near Wrenly *and* to have never spoken to anyone before Cinder.
