I've been miserable today, but I realized something to be grateful for.  I'm grateful that I don't live in a world with narrative causality.

Imagine for a moment that there were someone who was really good at improv.  In a world with narrative causality, anyone with improv skills would be up against fast talking challenges all the time, and they'd be talking their way in over their head all the time, too.  The skill wouldn't be allowed to just exist.  It would have to be *for* something, for getting them into and out of trouble.  That's stressful.

Now nix the narrative causality.  A talent for improv in the real world could make someone a really awesome player at tabletop roleplaying games.  That's dramatically less stressful.

I'm not good at improv.  Relatedly, I'm not good at tabletop roleplaying games.  Yet I love tabletop roleplaying games and I'm glad there ARE people who are good at them.  Absent narrative pressures, that skill can just exist, even if it's not *for* anything.  Life is for joy, and skills that are for nothing but joy are intensely beautiful.

We do live in a world where some people are desperate to stress others out, but at least stress isn't part of the basic structure of causality.
