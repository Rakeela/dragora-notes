12:02.  No writing yet.  The unevenness of the months is kind of an irritant.  I wish we had months of equivalent length, plus a multi-day festival at the turn of the calendar.  The festival can be a year longer on leap years.  I think that'd be a good system.

12:12.  28,874.  0 words on the chapter.

14:52.  30,026.  1,121 words on the chapter.

15:06.  30,107.  1,202 words on the chapter.  Need to break for an errand.

15:25.  Back.  Almost.  Gotta check something.

15:27.  Okay, I'm back.

16:04.  30,639.  1,734 words on the chapter.  I'm eager to get back to writing Kaire again.  I like kobolds, but it seems I like gryphons more.  I'm over-quota, so I'm going to take a break and do some reading.  I'll keep walking on my treadmill.

16:13.  I love this book about Manichaeism, "The Manichaean Body" by Jason David BeDuhn.  There is finally a book about religion that I can enjoy.

16:15.  I am thinking about my current Stellaris game.  Spiritualist-Egalitarian-Pacifist.  Not xenophilic.  They are, I imagine, convinced that they have found the ideal ideology.  They have no use for the inherent positivity of xenophilia.  The limitation of Stellaris to three points of governing ideology really pains me.  I would include xenophilia in this mixture.

17:56.  That is more than enough Stellaris for now.  Good grief.  That activity doesn't contribute to my understanding.  I hardly know why I'm drawn to it.  Obviously, I'm *trying* to imagine these galactic societies... but it doesn't help.  Reading my book about Manichaeism provides insight into spiritualist thought.  Playing my spiritualist empire in Stellaris does not.

19:26.  Time spent arguing online.  I consider some of that a civic duty.

22:26.  I got distracted watching Kistaro game.  Was that really several hours?  Ugh.  I'm tired.  I did a little bit of writing after my previous timepoint and before being distracted; current tally 30,820.  1,915 words on the chapter.  1,915 words of progress.  That's today's tally.
