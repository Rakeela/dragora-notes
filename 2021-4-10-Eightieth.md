...I created the file, and then I forgot what I wanted to say.  Drat.

[[imagine-a-brain-implant]] that makes that kind of thing impossible!

I'm reading this right now.  Putting aside my basic confusion over how humans could seem beautiful or gorgeous, and I suppose also my distaste for the word 'gorgeous' (it just doesn't sound like a 'beautiful' word to me; some kind of kiki-bouba violation), I can definitely understand how someone would not enjoy their workplace meetings frequently including the topic of the tech lead's loneliness.

It sounds like there was some uncertainty over whether this behavior constituted harassment...  It's certainly not the buttonholing lasviciousness that even I've been subject to.  I've been pushed against a wall before by someone whose affections I didn't appreciate!  I was, uh, physically stronger.  Thank god.  But I'm not very strong and I didn't want to rely on it ever.

It also sounds like this person was a victim of Google's office space shortage, of all things.  I've heard a lot of stories from Kistaro about how Google's offices are perpetually at their occupancy limit.  I can't think of any other reason why that most basic of accommodations (moving peoples' desks so that people who've conflicted aren't working next to each other) wouldn't be filled out.  I tend to eschew punishment as a means of ordering society, but definitely when people complain about each other, you should shift their desks so they're not working next to each other.

“People in wood houses shouldn’t light matches.”  This quote shows up regarding a request for promotion.  It suggests that the complaint 'started a fire'...  Obviously, it's a terrible line.  It's a high-impact 'wrong thing to say'.  I get it.

I always wonder if we're seeing everything.  I could write a lot of variations on this story with villains in different places.  Different kinds of fires.  One possibility that occurred to me which would be dreadful (about which the world would never know) would involve this women whose whole social life occurred at Google having discomfited people by seeking relationships there, the same way that her tech lead discomfited her.  In that case her complaint would be a reciprocity violation, substantially justifying the "fire in a wooden house" comment, which is about reciprocity errors.  Her commentary about moving too much of her life to the office suggests the possibility that this went on.  It would unironically be an example of female privilege if she were expecting to be able to seek relationships at Google and also to punish men who do the same.

I do still agree that asking to be set up with friends is a misuse of the work environment... but I wonder at the atomism of our society... fundamentally, I see a conflict between two people who both found their peers in one and only one organization.  I doubt this guy had any of the old dominance psychology; I rather expect that this woman's "harasser" only wanted to call her "queen" because he is himself an entirely submissive man.  We just... don't have a society where that would be smarmy, anymore.

I don't mean this to be a personal condemnation of someone I never have and never will meet, but I try to think of possible stories, and I thought of one here.  Maybe her coworkers and the investigators of her complaint felt like I do about the one-on-one meetings conduct (that it was improper) while at the same time being inclined to drag their feet on helping a more socially dominant person get away with charismatic hypocrisy against a more socially submissive person.

Although they still should've moved her desk.
