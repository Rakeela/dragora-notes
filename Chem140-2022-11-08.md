I didn't want to come to class today, but I felt I had to know what was being covered.  It turns out to be stoichiometry, which is chapter 8 in the book.

2 Al + 3 Cl2 --> 2 AlCl3

This is a balanced equation.

If there are literally the minimum number of each items, there would be 2 atoms of aluminum to three molecules of Cl2, and it would yield 2 molecules of AlCl3.

If these are interpreted as moles, then two moles of Al and three moles of Cl2 yields 2 moles of AlCl3.

If you have 1.5 moles of Al, how many moles of Cl2 do you need to balance the equation?  Multiply 1.5 mol Al by the known ratio of (3 mol Cl2/2 mol Al).  The result of this calculation is 2.25 mol Cl2.  Since this calculation started with two significant figures, it should end with two significant figures.  Thus the answer is 2.3 mol Cl2.

If you have 2.5 moles of O2 and 7.9 moles of H2, how many moles of H2O are produced when they interact?  First balance the reaction.  1 unit O2 reacts with 2 units H2 to create 2 units of H2O.  Then, calculate the yield from each quantity.  2.5 mol O2 is multiplied by the ratio (2 mol H2O/1 mol O2) to find 5.0 mol H2O.  7.9 mol H2 is multiplied by the ratio (2 mol H2O/2 mol H2) to yield 7.9 mol H2O.  The lower yield indicates the limiting reactant; the higher yield indicates the excess reactant.  In this reaction with reactants in these quantities, the limiting quantity is O2, and thus the answer is 5.0 moles H2O.

This quantity of 5.0 moles H2O is a theoretical yield, also known as a calculated or ideal yield.  Experimental yield is usually lower than theoretical yield.  This can be due to conditions being not 100% favorable, loss of the products in transfer processes (such as products sticking to a beaker), side reactions also occuring (such as when CO forms in combustion), or reversible reactions at equilibrium.
