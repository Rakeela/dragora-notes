14:51.  I'm cripplingly distracted and I've been overeating consistently lately.  Just wow.  Kistaro has no idea how much I've been eating.  I think I'm messing up my headspace by eating too much.

18:20.  Wow.  Hardcore distraction.  I feel like part of my brain is blanking and reformatting.  I'm developing a bit of an autohypnosis kink...  It feels good.  I wish I could feel this way while working.  This utter fixation.

18:27.  The game I've been playing has a protagonist who I've set to live in a lucid trance.

18:37.  My mind grew so quiet that I started to hear a faint squeaking of my joints as I moved.  It was a deeply familiar sound when I noticed it.  I wondered about its import.  Is it literally my joints that I'm hearing, or is it neurological feedback?
