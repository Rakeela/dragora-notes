I have a supply of agar powder arriving today.  If it arrives early, I'll try to make monksfruit mung gels today.  If it arrives late, I'll try to make them tomorrow.

This is a link to one of the pictures I made, which I titled Erraticity:

I love this picture.  I can imagine it in motion, kaleidoscopic.  I can also almost hear it.  It's a creaking kind of music.

I've made a lot of nonsense images, but I still consider visual arts to be the skill I've envied and never had.
