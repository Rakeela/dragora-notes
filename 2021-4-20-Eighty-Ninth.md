I have a supply of agar powder arriving today.  If it arrives early, I'll try to make monksfruit mung gels today.  If it arrives late, I'll try to make them tomorrow.

This is a link to one of the pictures I made, which I titled Erraticity:

I love this picture.  I can imagine it in motion, kaleidoscopic.  I can also almost hear it.  It's a creaking kind of music.

I've made a lot of nonsense images, but I still consider visual arts to be the skill I've envied and never had.

My shipment of agar powder arrived too late in the evening for me to make mung gels today.  Maybe tomorrow!

In other news, I've been contemplating psoriasis as another experimental target.  I'm recording a note to myself here to open an experimental proposal node for it, formalizing my hypothesis about psoriasis and mental health comorbidities.  If psoriasis is also a target for immunological treatment, that could be another source of medical productivity in working with dendritic cells.
