# Notes on Recombinant Protein Construction

While studying RNA vaccines lately, I've become fixated on the question of how antigenic surface proteins are generated.  How do researchers discover which sequence of RNA will produce which specific surface spikes on cells?  While nominally studying tolerogenic dendritic cells ([[notes-on-tolerogenic-dendritic-cells]]), I realized that what I'm actually curious about are recombinant proteins.  Unless I've made an error in designating this page (very possible), all of these antigenic surfaces are themselves proteins.  They're bits of the protein structures of cells after being pulled apart and put back together again by cellular machinery.  The question of how we discover how to code for an antigenic surface must be a question about how we invent recombinant proteins.

I should like to figure out the process here so that I can add it to me General Protocol.
