# Notes on Recombinant Protein Construction

While studying RNA vaccines lately, I've become fixated on the question of how antigenic surface proteins are generated.  How do researchers discover which sequence of RNA will produce which specific surface spikes on cells?  While nominally studying tolerogenic dendritic cells ([[notes-on-tolerogenic-dendritic-cells]]), I realized that I also need to be studying the invention processes used to generate recombinant proteins.

Unless I've made an error in designating this page (very possible), all of the antigenic surfaces that I'm interested in studying are themselves proteins.  They're bits of the protein structures of cells after being pulled apart and put back together again by cellular machinery.  Their nature as proteins is why we can also discover RNA strands which code for their creation.  The question of *how* we discover how to code for an antigenic surface must therefore be a question about how we invent recombinant proteins.  Once we've reinvented a protein, we can use it to sensitize or (I would propose, via tolerogenesis) desensitize the immune system as we see fit, at least within the limits of the immune system's existing cellular interfaces.

I should like to figure out the process of invention for this so that I can add it to my General Protocol.  This would be a convenient thing to reduce to procedure.

I am cognitively bouncing off of this task.  I can tell what I'm doing, mentally.  I'm searching for how to provide a better Y than unknown values of Y for 'I want to produce recombinant antigen surface X, for arbitrary values of X' and 'the first place I need to look is Y, for unknown values of Y'.  If I already knew this task, I would already know where to look for information about how to begin producing a recombinant protein.

This source is about how recombinant proteins are produced, but not about how they are invented.

I'm including this as much to attest for my having gone anywhere as for it being a good start.  The way that this talks about expressing DNA is very straightforward about the application of DNA, but still leaves me mystified about how to identify gene sequences.  The more I study, the more I know of what I don't know.

This is something of an overview of protein environments.  Proteomics must be the kind of thing that I'm trying to study here.  I want to master the proteomics of tolerogenic dendritic cells so that I can author a protocol for solving one kind of immunosenesence.  More specifically to this file, I want to learn how specific proteins are identified as being encoded for by specific genes.

Directing the construction of RNA-encoded proteins is the faculty which RNA vaccination relies on in dendritic cells by which it can provide antigenic surfaces to professional antigenic presentation cells.  Dendritic cells are enthusiastic phagocytosers which pull apart potential pathogens and then try to present useful bits of protein from them.  How chaotic is that process?

Some very dishonest people who are holding science in the grip of stalking abuses of power have "not" hinted that what I'm looking for is structure prediction.  -_-

I wish liberalism had been allowed to survive in America.  The more liberal society of my youth had a darkness that I fell into, but at least it would've acknowledged my efforts and spoken directly to me about things I need to know, instead of leaving me to make grasping inferences from hints dropped by stalking "scientists" who rely on hackers, corruption, and general authoritarianism.  The people who enforced that darkness which stole over a decade of my life were *always* the people who used liberalism as an excuse to violate the rights of others.  Violating the privacy of others is not a tool for opposing serial killers, it's what serial killers themselves have to do to not get caught, and I resent being expected "scientifically" to trust in the unknown benevolence of observers who claim an imbalanced right of power over me.  This is medieval; it represents a serious slide in the ability of what should be a consent-maximizing section of the population to actually consent-maximize, creating rational trust gaps that are injurious to human potential.  Fake liberals using liberalism as an excuse to victimize the unwary destroyed things that they shouldn't have.

As for the relevance of protein structure prediction...  They're not wrong, they're just also rapists.  I see the "scientific" reliance on this kind of conduct as being of a kind with those who molested me, who were after all ostensibly transhumanists.  Trying to work with/for hackers is unsurvivably demoralizing.  I couldn't make porn for those people either, and then for years I was "primitive" and "a utility monster" because I betrayed them.  I wanted to do actual research!  Transhumanism didn't need a dragon prostitute and it shouldn't have pretended I was imposing myself.  I didn't want to be that.  I was tolerant of it when I was pressed to it, for a while, but it was under duress and I never stopped complaining that I was stressed by performance anxiety and uncertain of the purpose of being a sexual performer.

I want to make non-authoritarian connections someday and be safe from people who insist on violating my consent "to be safe".  I haven't violated the consent of others and I deserve safety, too.  Society should not be structured to make safety the exclusive province of those who commit crimes against others for safety's sake.  A population that violates others to be safer is a population that kills people who create hazards to them.  Nobody is advanced who can't operate their life consensually; nobody is scientific who cannot rely on gaining power through the reveal of information.  Gaining power by obscuring information - as corruption and authoritarianism rely upon - is obscurantism, the opposite of science.

I'll citationize this at the top of the next section.  Right now I'm depressed, and martialing emotional energy for a school exam is more important than adding another citation to my studies.

For fuck's sake, unknowable omnisciences are God.  That's what gets praised in every church.  If I wanted to trust in unknowable omnisciences, I'd be praying for holy knowledge instead of studying research papers.  The observation structures that people can't share aren't scientific.  People violating whoever is vulnerable to extract all possible information from them have ruled throughout history.  Society stepped away from it *briefly* and every category of evil slumped.  Nobody should ever watch me in any environment unless I can watch them watching me and watch them in kind, and nobody should ever use a tool of observation that can't be fully exposed to transparency.  The observation tools that can't be revealed are *criminal*, and commiting crimes against people is *violating their consent*.  That's rape culture.  It'd still be rape culture if the perpetrators were asexual, and I happen to be in a position to know by experience that some of them *aren't*.

I don't believe in the virtue of unknowable omnisciences.  I don't think rule-by-unknowable-omniscience ever accomplished anything but entrenching abuse in society and making humans better at murdering people who would otherwise change human social systems.  All observers should be revealed.  I'd rather have no privacy for anyone than allow privacy to remain a special privilege of "scientific" authoritarians who violate others.

I loathe taking insight from places where admitting to how I really figured something out would get me gaslit.  It's demoralizing the same way being pandered as a morale aid was demoralizing.  The stuff people can't talk about still happens, but it shouldn't be part of science except when it's being studied.

Included for interest as much as anything...  I'm reasonably sure there's more up-to-date information available somewhere.  Yet this does attest to proteins being predicted by sequence variation.  I was already *aware* that there are well-studied methods for this, I just don't *know* them...  If I can find them, assembling my General Protocol should be straightforward.  If the protocol involves "use this modeling software package on a machine with at least X processing power and Y RAM", that's fine.  I wasn't expecting to record a bunch of protein folding estimate methodology here.

If this kind of analysis engine has a definable procedure for gaining access to it with well-defined points of access control (such as fees, queues, or gatekeepers), it could feature in the protocol.  More broadly, I hope this gets used very enthusiastically for simulating self-antigens, as their senescence implications are worth taking notice of.

I should also cross-record this one in my [[Science-News-Archive]].
