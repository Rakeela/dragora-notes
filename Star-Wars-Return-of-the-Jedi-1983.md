#Star-Wars-Return-of-the-Jedi-1983

Date First Watched:  Forgotten
Dates Rewatched:  Never

I have to list all of these, but I can't write much about them...  I remember the Jedi and the Sith of course, but much of that memory is from what I really loved, which was Knights of the Old Republic, a game produced much later.
