I've had the config file in Obsidian change itself on me.  What the dickens does "file-recovery": true mean in the config, and why did it change when I haven't touched the file?  I don't intend to upload the changed config file until I understand why it changed.

While talking about this unexpected change with Kistaro, we talked briefly about JSON, which to me looks very approachable.  Python apparently has built-in JSON support, and it occurred to me that this looks like a way that I could store state data for a simulation such that I would find it comprehensible to create and iterate code over.  I may bring back one of my old failed simulation engine projects with the idea of implementing it around a human-readable JSON simulation state.

Despite my complaints with a certain group who once said, "We can only give so many Python tutorials!" to me, I think there'd be a kind of justice in my learning Python anyways.  The people who hurt me *do* have some compassion, and the fact that they hurt me *hurts* them.  That's not what I expected, but it's the impression that I've gotten.

This is kind of...  easier.  I can wear the symbols of my pain on my sleeves, and my vengeance is thus completed in full.  Since I was hurt by people who did not *want* to hurt me, any vengeance beyond a life lived well would be wildly disproportionate.  So my vengefulness is using the name "Ihroun" in a certain context, where by reference to something I tried in suffering I can remind people who believed I suffered not that they were infringing on me greviously, and learning Python would be a sting of the same kind to people who thought their dealings with me were irreproachable.

...when I think about it that way, I guess I am capable of schadenfreude and vengefulness.  I adore the prosperity of even people who've done me wrong.

For no apparent reason, I just thought of a dream I once had about a human FTL experiment in a laboratory orbiting Venus causing a planet-breaking explosion which sent the shattered chunks of Venus into an orbit that would eventually collide with Mars.  In that dream, Mars had been colonized by biotechnologists who engineered new forms of life, turning it into a cold arboreal wonder with dragons in the public, and so there was a great stress to perform the largest evacuation in history during the years of orbits before that fatal orbit where the largest ejected chunk of Venus would intersect with Mars.  The impact was not expected to have survivors, as it was slated to be the second largest explosion in history; planetologists were aghast at the idea that such an impact could only be second largest.

Despite this hazard, FTL research continued; the scale of the energetic anomaly provoked by the activation of the drive had just been too far off of the projections to tolerate, as it was an observation highly disruptive to what was then-believed about physics.  The FTL research community was moved to a base near Pluto instead, so that they could perform experiments beyond the immediate proximity of all gravity wells, where an explosion of the magnitude that occurred near Venus would not occur near anything at all.  At length, the project neared the state that the disastrous Venusian research project had approached, and had constructed a test drive which their calculations suggested should provide for FTL mobility when activity, and which they believed would not detonate as the other one had.  So there came the fateful moment when the engine itself was to be activated...

Well, there *was* an explosion.  The engine *still* did not behave as expected when it was activated.  The exploding engine just wasn't hugely destructive this time.  At least, it was not destructive to the test fleet who had carried it beyond all planetary orbits to test it...  Yet it seemed to blow a hole in the side of reality when it detonated, and the prototype ship which had tried to go FTL was now half-stuck into a portal hundreds of miles wide that lead to an unexpected different reality, which looked like nothing so much as a wireframe road surrounded by wireframe stripmall being trafficked via flying car.

The crews of the observation fleet and the prototype ship checked their sensor data in with home base on Pluto, and when enough time had passed for them to receive acknowledgments, they flew into the wireframe place, their spaceships no larger than the wireframe 'flying cars'.  A robotic probe alerted to the presence of the arrivers, this being the first observed thing in the wireframe place which was not a wireframe; with great flashing lights atop it, it flew amidst the explorers broadcasting something in the correct communication protocols yet which transmission was found to contain only sound files of speech in an alien language and an inscrutable green symbolic pattern covered in flashing red bits.  It then flew to the other side of the portal still broadcasting, its transmission repeating continuously.

That was when I woke up.  I enjoy that dream on many levels.  It was long, complex, and beautiful.
