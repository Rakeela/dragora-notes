# 2020-11-27-Fourth

I have a tendency towards temporary severe obsession.  I mentioned the three day pattern in [[2020-11-19-First]] as something that strikes my creative projects, but what brought the same defect to salience today is that can lose a day or two when an interesting new videogame seizes my attention.

I've spent today playing [[Nova-Drift]].  It's hard to regret.  Pain hasn't really impacted my awareness today.  Good videogames counter the universal negative training factor induced by chronic pain.  One of the reasons that I want to live forever is that there are more fun videogames than I have time to play...  so *many* more that I couldn't have time to play through everything I want to play through even if I did literally nothing else with my life, especially given that my tastes typically run more towards strategy games (very slow) rather than arcade games.  More games release all the time, too.  This drives me towards the [[immortalist]] sentiment, and the [[posthumanist]] as well.  This is where a certain kind of spaceship fantasy comes in for me; if I could 'be' a spaceship AI, most of the processes of the ship would operate over such long timescales that I could have a productive isolation even though I would fully intend to turn most of my computational resources over to playing games and simulating appealing transformation patterns.

The thought structures refined by playing Nova Drift, though...  Not useful at all to my projects.  While enthralling in a flashing lights and explosions sense, it doesn't stimulate my love of societal analysis, my specific creativity in my own projects, or my research interests.  If I had a real solution to chronic pain, a 'universal negative training factor' wouldn't be an obstacle to my cognition, and the relative hedonic advantage of videogames vs other activities would tilt in favor of other activities.  It's already true that I'd rather study than play most of the videogames I own.  That is an unforced preference.  Pain can be flushed from awareness by superstimuli, but the desirability of superstimuli can be outcompeted by desirable ordinary stimuli.  I suspect that superstimuli fail more readily when aversion to pain isn't driving engagement... these thoughts link naturally to [[exploited-hyperpalatability]], since letting superstimuli run rampant causes conditions that cause pain which drives strengthened adherence to superstimuli, which is the kind of damaging feedback loop that differentiates hyperpalatability from [[hedonology]].  *This* bit tends to drive me towards more immediate [[transhumanist]] sentiment, because I think we need the more impressive medical interventions made possible by bionics and rejuvenative technologies in order to deal with stubborn pain points throughout society.  There's a lot of people who could be both happier and more productive if we had more medical technology.

...oops, I've run right across the midnight line before I posted this.
