#Universal-tolerogenic-dendritic-cell-experiment-1

Proposed experiment:
	1) Culture three populations of murine dendritic cells with any known murine MHC genes.
		Cell group 1:  Unmodified murine dendritic cells.
		Cell group 2:  Murine dendritic cells treated for tolerogenesis
		Cell group 3:  MHC-1 knockout dendritic cells treated for tolerogenesis
	2) Identify and sort a population of mice whose genes DO NOT match the MHC genes in the dendritic cell cultures into three groups.
		Mouse group 1:  To be injected with cell group 1 (the control)
		Mouse group 2:  To be injected with cell group 2
		Mouse group 3:  To be injected with cell group 3
	3) Medically observe all three groups for signs of allotransplant rejection syndrome.

Hypothesis 1:  Dendritic cells modified for exclusively tolerogenic application are already a universal donor population, because they will promote tolerance to themselves as well as to their target antigens.  Cell group 2 tests this.

Hypothesis 2:  MHC-1 receptors are not used for inducing tolerance, and are therefore more antigenic, but MHC-2 receptors are used for inducing tolerance.  Therefore, MHC-1 knockout dendritic cells modified for exclusively tolerogenic application are a universal donor population.  Cell group 3 tests this.

Base expectation:  All three mouse groups should show rejection syndromes consistent with the symptoms of mouse group 1.

Success in either hypothesis would be indicated by a lack of allotransplant rejection syndrome.
