Bleh, I have to attend class on Halloween.

NH4+ (Ammonium) is a polyatomic ion.

Ionic compounds (NH4+ or Metal + nonmetal)
NH4+ or metal provides the cation.  The nonmetal provides the anion.

1) Binary ionic with metals having fixed charge.  Monatomic ions only.  Memorize the metals with fixed charges.  Group IA, Group IIA, Al3+, Sc3+, Zn2+, Ag+
2) Binary ionic with variable charge metals.  The rest of the metals have variable charge.  CuCl is formed of Cu+ and Cl-.  CuCl2 is formed of Cu2+ and Cl-.  These are named copper(I) chloride and copper(II) chloride respectively.  PbO is formed of Pb2+ and O2-.  PbO2 is made of Pb4+ and O2-.  They are named lead(II) oxide and lead(IV) oxide respectively.  Copper(I) oxide is formed of Cu+ and O2- for a formula of Cu2O.
3) Ions with several elements involved.  This is where polyatomic ions come into play.  A polyatomic ion is a group of atoms that are covalently bonded and carrying a charge overall.  The most important polyatomic ion is NH4+, the ammonium ion.  Use parenthesis if more than one polyatomic, ie (NH4)3PO4.

For all ionic compounds the number of positive charge equals the number of negative charge.  This is the principle of electroneutrality.  It is always followed.  If you have an ion formed of Na1+ and O2-, you get Na2O (sodium oxide).  If you have an ion formed of Al33+ and O2-, you get Al2O3 (aluminum oxide).

Ionic compounds
1) Transfer of electrons cation & anion
2) Metal or NH4+ & nonmetal ion or polyatomic ion
3) Usually solid at 20 degree celsius; high melting point
4) Formula is simplest ratio of ions also called empirical formula, which is the true formula for ionic compounds.

NaCl CaCl2 CuCl2 NH4Cl  CaCO3 

Molecular compounds
1) Sharing of electron-cooperation of valence electron covalent bond
2) Non metals, metalloids eg CO2, SiCl4, H2O
3) Some are solids, liquids, and gases melting point low
4) Some compounds may have same molecular formula as the empirical formula

The empirical formula is the ratio of the atoms present, but the molecular formula is how those atoms are actually bound together.
