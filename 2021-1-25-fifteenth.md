I've had trouble with simple reversal errors all my life.  From finding "left" and "right" harder to learn in childhood (arbitrary) than the concept of negative numbers (highly intuitive), to more recently finding it hard to remember simple binary labels essential to interpreting statistics...  Long enough ago that I'm reading off my pre-awakening memory skein to say this, I got to first grade knowing how to work with negative numbers, but still getting left and right confused.  I don't think it stopped being an effortful distinction by the start of second grade.

More recently, I've been finding it challenging to remember which is the dependent and which is the independent variables.  I haven't been losing points in class over this.  I think I understand the concept.  It's just effortful to affix the label to the concept.  When I'm faced with two labels for two opposite directions, the labels feel like the same kind of arbitrary that "left" and "right" felt like.  This seems to be a consistent part of my cognition.  It's like a hardware issue.

Hardware is an old metaphor for the brain which seemed popular some twenty years ago.  The brain you think with is your hardware.  The thoughts you think on it are your software.  Your core values towards which you modify yourself over time are the expression of your user agent.  One of the nice things about this metaphor is that, while extraordinarily technophilic, there's nothing about this metaphor which is contradictory to spiritual interpretations of reality.  The fact of volition establishes sufficiently that the user-agent exists, and this is true independently of whether they are implemented in hardware, software, or an unknown exterior reality.  The metaphor itself is fundamentally rooted in valuing form-independent empathy; people matter no matter what kind of brain they think with, and that value increases as you get towards their self-determination.

The metaphor is also presumptively anti-authoritarian.  The user-agent is presumed to be in power: allowed to self-modify and guide the conditions of their life.  I had originally wrote that first sentence in this paragraph as "the metaphor is also fundamentally anti-authoritarian," because I wished to validate an aspect of the society I grew up with that was never comprehensibly used to harm me.  It's unfortunately somewhat intrinsically difficult to wish to conserve aspects of the society I grew up with given the events of my own life experiences.  At the same time, I really do want to validate it.  I would say that I grew up in the presence of many gentle atheistic pressures and a few gentle religious pressures, from which I learned respect for both and a belief that compassion is monopolized by neither party, but indeed I learned a general expectation that the distinctly atheistic and the distinctly Christian are both more likely than the average person to be of unusual virtue.

As a child I loved both science and faith.  I have always found pleasure in contemplating faith.  I held from an early age and of my own devising - I will never forget this - that to study Creation was the finest devotion to the Creator.  Nobody in my life said that to me before I said it to the pastor.  I do not believe that there exists a fundamental disconnect between religion and science.  I do not believe that nations grow more soulless when they become more atheistic; I do not believe that the descent to fundamentalism is inevitable when nations become more religious.  The divide between authoritarianism and anti-authoritarianism is such as I believe to be more fundamental.  For if a religion survives on the defense that people must have the right to speak as they believe to be true, is it not offering real sociological information which might otherwise be obscured?  The persistence of ignorance, though oft-lamented, is not necessarily the persistence of evil, nor is it necessarily a font of hostility to the pursuit of truth should ignorance persist due to the public's right to speak their beliefs.  People form their beliefs of their life experiences, and as science is the pursuit of the description of this reality, it is uniquely positioned to inform the public's life experiences.

In Nationstates, one of the lines hostile to religion (though presented as a source of gain in religiousness) goes like this: "Cassocked priests and choirboys believe what happens behind closed doors stays there."  I went through that.  I was in a protestant denomination, but I loved the pastor very much.  What did I go through?  What happened out of sight of all the world?  The pastor gave me invitations to volunteering opportunities, told me that a truly benevolent god would not punish any virtuous person in history (aka "the doctrine of the virtuous pagan"), and gifted me books on philosophy.  It's like...  Whyyyyy am I obligated to consider this decision with this event outcome as something protective of criminality?  I'm not at all convinced of the statistical relevance of the scenario actually described in the issue.  I know what real-world abominations that outcome string is referencing 'humorously', but I also know from real-world statistics comparing the rates of serious interpersonal abuse in first world vs third world nations that protecting people's civil rights IS how you build a society which behaves more ethically over time.  I want people like the pastor who gave me philosophy books in secret - in a harsh community, I'll note! - to have the right of their heresies.  That man was a pacifist and a major component of my own development of pacifist ideals.

If every private area were tapped, he would've been caught spreading teachings outside of the faith.  I faced a lot of violence growing up, and my dad faced some, too.  In that community, would encouraging philosophy and a deep respect for others actually have been a permitted reason to diverge from theological adherence?  When do religions ever willingly permit theological divergence?

Well, courtesy of that pastor, I know of one modern religion that would permit theological divergence under comprehensible yet never obligatory terms.  The motto of that faith sounds like this, "Go in peace, serve the Lord."

I think about environmentalism often, but I have a lot of sympathy for non-environmentalists.  I outright value industrialism.  I see eco-industrialism as humanity's necessary challenge.  I don't despair of China's industrial might, I despair of China's mighty industrial smog.
