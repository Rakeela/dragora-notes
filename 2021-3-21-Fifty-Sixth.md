I really don't want to organize anything.  I don't want to create any organizations at all.  It sounds like a lot of work for a world that is compulsively hateful and desperate to tear down anything that would make 'the wrong people' happy, as humans seem to be.  Whatever organization I build, someone is going to want it to fail.

Philosophically, a hatred is any state of affinity where you actively want others to suffer.  Practically, I think the difference between a dislike and a hatred is that dislikes have objectives and hatreds are just robotic programming.  I understand why people dislike violent ghetto culture; I don't understand why humans hate dark skin.  Avoiding violence is an objective; hating dark skin is programming.  People can balance their dislikes, but they're obedient to their hatreds.

I'll try to do what seems to be necessary, but I'm grateful to the university for being a step that takes time.  I'm glad that I'm not in a position where I presently have to be bootstrapping an organization.  I'm not looking forward to it.
