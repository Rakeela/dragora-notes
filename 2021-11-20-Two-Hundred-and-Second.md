My ability to read IS coming back to me!  I have read a book today!  And if I have been a bit out of my mind reading this all at once, so that I cannot be sure that I have read it in one day or in two, I am either way satisfied, for this is the velocity with which I could once consume books!  I have read the majority of it today.

I reread The Magician's Nephew, first (though not first written) in the Chronicles of Narnia.  I have the rest of the set, and I'm excited to read them.  I need to keep practicing.  I have so many other things to read as well, I hope my practice bears the fruit of letting me get at the others just as readily!
