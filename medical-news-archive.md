# Medical News Archive

This is for unsorted links to medical news with headlines, potentially also with commentary.  Since I'm starting this in the pandemic era, it has the likelihood of being bleak.

https://www.livescience.com/schizophrenia-covid-19-death-risk-factor.html - Schizophrenia is 2nd highest risk factor for dying of COVID-19, after age - Retrieved January 30, 2021
Commentary:  Reading this so soon after completing that RNA vaccine essay for class has made me wonder if there may be new medical treatment potentials for schizophrenia.  In addition to reducing the suffering (and expensiveness!) of a population that suffers greatly (and is very expensive), it could be timely; failing to deal with hard cases in a quarantine era can encourage increased mutation challenge.

https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-01-30/long-term-covid-19-patients-are-incubating-dangerous-new-coronavirus-strains - Dangerous new coronavirus strains may incubate in COVID-19's sickest - Retrieved January 30, 2021
Commentary:  Since medical triage can't authorize culling the immunodeficient without a very advanced level of existential risk acknowledgment, control of [[existential threat]] subcategory [[plague]] requires that society get better at handling immunodeficiencies.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/27/us/covid-school-teaching.html - As Pandemic Upends Teaching, Fewer Students Want to Pursue It - Retrieved 2021-3-31.
Commentary:  The comment on this about how being online is draining is very salient.  Telepresence "isn't there yet" for humanity, because right now the internet is a very substantial barrier to getting things done for reasons that go beyond mere distraction potential.

https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-immune-system-protects-the-brain-20210428/ - A Backdoor Lets the Immune System Monitor the Brain - Retrieved 2021-4-30.  Commentary:  This is about how the immune system doesn't constantly infiltrate brain tissue, but instead observes egress points for pathogens to learn when it needs to mount an immune response.  The immune system is too dangerous for constant neural activation.  I think that this kind of information could lead to new treatments for brain tumors and brain pathogens if researchers mapped the "spotty" coverage of the brain's immune surveillance; the same maps may also produce predictive maps for where problems are most likely to arise.

https://phys.org/news/2019-10-mitochondria-tesla-battery.html - Mitochondria work much like Tesla battery packs, study finds - Retrieved 2021-5-1.  Commentary:  I read this, thinking about how different species have mitochondria that work differently.  If you look at hummingbird mitochondria, and then you look at cactus mitochondria, is the difference between them structural or chemical?  As DNA codes for life, I'm assuming the difference is genetic either way.  Could we (for instance) accelerate mitochondria by transplanting genes that make the inner membrane wrinklier, or do we need to transplant genes that alter the chemicals in the interior of the mitochondria?

https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/05/21/infrastructure-neglect-water-towers-add-millions-illnesses/6769259002/ - Dead snakes and mice, toxic sludge: How pathogens go unnoticed in America's water towers - Retrieved 2021-5-23.  Commentary:  [[2021-5-23-One-Hundred-and-Fifth]]

https://www.livescience.com/diabetes-vaccine-shows-promise-early-trial-subset-patients.html - Diabetes vaccine shows promise for some patients in early trial - Retrieved 2021-5-27.  Commentary:  Tolerogenic dendritic cells should do even better.

https://apnews.com/article/gene-therapy-business-science-health-b2b670011d52968c9f21d30ca2ca7fae - Newer methods may boost gene therapy's use for more diseases - Retrieved 2021-6-2.  Commentary:  Nothing ground-breaking here, but I'm glad to see media discussion of gene vectors.  I think gene therapy is someday going to be seen as a form of basic medical service in a more protean society.

https://www.foxnews.com/health/israeli-scientists-extend-mices-lives-aim-humans-next - Israeli scientists extend mice's lives by 23%, aim for humans next - Retrieved 2021-6-2.  Commentary:  I feel obligated to record this.  It's about the use of SIRT-6 to improve aging metabolisms.  Anti-aging isn't just one thing, and all the different things it is have to be advanced.
