10:33.  Bleh.  Last night Starfield crashed while I was trying to set up a base.

12:36.  It took me a long time to feel alert today.  I'm kinda letting myself go?  It's Saturday?  But I still hated being so tired.

12:37.  As I've thought about my mind today, I've felt like I still have a trauma-driven mind.  I still hold tightly onto random, negative associations while forgetting about an abundance of positive experiences.

(This part added the next day.)  I had a small, pleasant roleplaying session last night with a friend.  It was still tense at moments, but not nearly as stressful as the older sessions had been.
