13:47.  91,123.  I'm working really slowly today as I grapple with how undescriptive my writing is.

21:43.  I spent hours working on a TTRPG thing.  I did most of it, at least.  I can run it now.  I think.  I'm so bothered by not-hunger.  A desire for food.  I'm not properly hungry.  I want ramen.

21:44.  I want ramen, even though it'd be an absurd brief thing.  Alternatively, I want plant-based sausages.  I can have either one tomorrow, but I shouldn't have any more food tonight.  I ate a ton earlier.
