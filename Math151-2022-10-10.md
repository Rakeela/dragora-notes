I forgot my graphing calculator today.  I have one more day in which that is not a critical error, because tomorrow I have a major test and I won't even be allowed to use my computer as a calculator.  Getting a calculator from the teacher will be a disaster.  I'm used to the calculator I have.  The calculator I have has very advanced features. 

I got a 70% on my first quiz.  I consider that to be *doing badly*.  I hope I don't have to retake Calculus 1.  I'm terrified of tomorrow's test.  The homework took me an hour per problem.

Some of the demands from this test seem to be intentionally alleviated, reducing the amount of algebra that I need to do.  If I understood the reduced demands, I could feel better about getting the test completed in time.  Unfortunately, I don't understand the reduced demands.  I get vaguely that fewer steps need to be shown, but I don't understand exactly where the cut-off is.  I'm so used to having to simplify everything as much as possible.

Oh my god I wish I understood the lectures.  The guy is just wordsing at us.  I'm not getting anything from this.  I'm gaining calculus skill from my own study, but I'm not sure there's any point in my attending these classes.  I'm also worried that I'm not gaining skill on my own fast enough to clear the class.

If I tell Kistaro this, it's Kistaro's interpretation that the teacher sucks, but I think that's wrong.  I think the fault is mine.  The other students are just *quicker* at math.

I believe he's told us that the derivative of tangent is secant^2 and the derivative of secant is secant x tangent.  I hope I don't have to repeat that on the test.  I've studied sin and cosine with the homework, but not tangent and secant.

Oh my god how much of this is on the test.  Isn't today reviewing for the test?  I thought we'd only need sin and cos rules for this test.
