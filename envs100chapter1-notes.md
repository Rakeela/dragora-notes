Hm, I started reading, and I forgot I was filling this out.  I'm not accustomed to taking notes yet.  There's an actual skill I don't have here, isn't there?  I feel like this entire project is grasping towards that skill.  As I mesh more overlapping activities together around my schoolwork, it's getting... more interesting, I guess is the way to put it.  It's also getting a little scarier.  I'm putting more time into it, but I'm not sure I'm also accomplishing more.  I can't tell yet.

The chapter 1 quiz is untimed and online.  Nothing really stops me from having the book open and just working through the quiz that way.  I'm almost tempted to write down the questions and answers here, then work through the book to resolve them.  I know I can't quite do that.  Publishing my thoughts as I engage with the material is one thing, but posting the full questions and answers here would create an academic integrity risk factor.
