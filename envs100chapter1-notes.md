Hm, I started reading, and I forgot I was filling this out.  I'm not accustomed to taking notes yet.  There's an actual skill I don't have here, isn't there?  I feel like this entire project is grasping towards that skill.  As I mesh more overlapping activities together around my schoolwork, it's getting... more interesting, I guess is the way to put it.  It's also getting a little scarier.  I'm putting more time into it, but I'm not sure I'm also accomplishing more.  I can't tell yet.

The chapter 1 quiz is untimed and online.  Nothing really stops me from having the book open and just working through the quiz that way.  I'm almost tempted to write down the questions and answers here, then work through the book to resolve them.  I know I can't quite do that.  Publishing my thoughts as I engage with the material is one thing, but posting the full questions and answers here would create an academic integrity risk factor.

So far, chapter 1 itself is blathering a lot about the sciences.  It's a pretty basic "what is science" material, and I'm not sure which part if any of this would turn out to have fallen out of my head if I got tested on it.  I'm quite confident that the material in it won't be in any test, but there is a very interesting sidebar that talks about how the islanders on Rapa Nui used rock barriers to protect their fields after deforestation gave them a horrible soil erosion problem.  Keeping the wind off their fields became essential to maintaining soil quality.  Now there's a lesson that keeps getting relearned around the world!  Maybe we need to start subsidizing the construction of stone fences in aridified regions, hah.

There's something basically comforting about seeing a kind and polite affirmation of the problem of overpopulation.  While I can't say that my upbringing gave me the best sense for what home ought to feel like, the comforting sense of sanity and predictable benevolence that I get from anti-overpopulation sentiments is about what I expect a home ought to feel like.  It just feels like people thinking comprehensibly.

On a related note, there's a section in chapter 1 about environmental ethics.  When I see this text start in on the third paragraph of this section describing relativistic vs universalistic ethics, that's still somewhere I adore.  I believe that universalistic ethic exists, but I also believe that all universalists describe an incorrect system of ethics.  It is possible for a sufficiently advanced relativistic system of ethics to be more correct than a sufficiently incorrect universalistic ethic.  I believe that a perfect universal system of ethics would be detailed beyond human reasoning with contingencies and precise degrees, by which complexity it would appear substantially relativistic to a human universalist, while also being very easily disagreed with in many specifics.  As I believe a source of intrinsic error exists within ethics (being the one improbably perfect actually-universal ethic), I do not believe that the categorization conflict between relative ethics vs universal ethics is sufficient of itself to dispatch someone from the ranks of those sincerely concerned with ethics.

I'm not sure that the text's observation of ethics as a prescriptive pursuit is wholly accurate.  I think that it would be more accurate to say that ethics is *mostly* a prescriptive pursuit.  Descriptive ethics aimed at discovering virtue within behavior not otherwise coordinated around ethical concerns (or for which the ethical concerns have not been recorded and clarified from an outside perspective) is among the research pursuits of relativistic ethicists.  That course is almost, but not quite, intrinsically aligned to relativistic ethics, for a universalist avowing a belief in the perfect ethics of a society could do the same thing, but no sensible person interested in ethics can long retain a belief in the flawlessness of any society.

The text talks about the duties of conservation, of avoiding disproportionate exposure of some communities to pollution, and of the question of driving species to extinction.  It presents these things as subjects of potential agreement.  Very well, I'll put down my thoughts:
    1.  I don't personally think that "the present generation" is obligated to conserve resources for "future generations".  However, I do value environmentalism.  The way that circle squares within my mind is that I'm [[immortalist]].  I don't think people ought to die.  If the present generation extends indefinitely, the duty of conservation exists whether or not future generations exist.
    2.  It isn't possible to level out pollution burdens.  Homogenous pollution is neither possible nor desirable.  We should avoid disproportionate burdens /as much as possible/, but this responsibility is inherently finite due to diminishing returns.  If inequality is grotesque, leveling out pollution's impacts is likely to be efficient.  Smaller inequalities demand too many resources to further equalize pollution impacts, and may lead to weird edge-cases in the logic.  For instance, should we create pollutant sources to afflict environments full of people whose whole life is structured in a way that would minimize their pollutant structures?  I don't think so.  Furthermore, this counterexample demonstrates that some level of disproportionate impact is ethically acceptable; some people are not contributing pollutants, yet are exposed to fewer pollutants due to rational pollutant avoidance.  To remove rational pollutant avoidance from environmental policy would be insensate, suggesting that there exists a  (low) level of disproportionate impact which satisfies all relevant ethical obligations.
    3.  I have an instrumental view of biodiversity which can support extinction-promoting policies in theory, but due to my interest in biotechnology, my instrumental view of biodiversity is generally very favorable to the preservation of biodiversity.  Each lifeform expresses subtly different chemistry within its body, and it is difficult to know in advance which species will contain chemical knowledges that we would like to utilize in society somehow.  Thus I believe in a heavily precautionary attitude to biodiversity, and I consider biodiversity preservation important to the future health and technological advance of humanity.  This preservation of health and technological potential is such as I consider to be an ethical concern itself, and thus I am currently unaware of cases where I consider the destruction of species to be ethical for any species other than pathogenic microbes.  For the case of pathogens, extermination of free-roaming populations is highly desirable, and the preservation of pathogens should happen only in databases, long-term sealed archives, and isolated hazard-rated laboratories.

These stances are anthropocentric, which I consider justified by the primacy of sapience.  Believe me though, I'd give sapience out a lot more freely than it seems to have been handed out on Earth, haha...  Also, I consider that some of the more probably-sapient animals already measure on my metrics, and so for instance I regard killings of dolphins, whales, elephants, parrots, crows, and a few other animals to be actual acts of murder.  It's important to define ethics with room for error on the correct side of the line; I'd rather refrain from killing something that ultimately wasn't sapient, than to kill a thing that might be sapient on the grounds that it probably isn't!

I'm a little uncertain about this text's claim that low-income Americans in Appalachia are suffering some kind of political repression from the coal mining going on in the area.  I'm under the impression (potentially mistaken) that coal mining tends to be... if not exactly popular in its region, then at least valued as a kind of hard and worthy labor.  People in those regions care about the welfare of coal workers in a way that has them want coal mining to be better, but environmentalists would prefer that coal mining was just stopped.  I almost do, too.  I only love coal for chemistry.  It has the advantage of being a great carbon source.  As a fuelstock, it's completely awful and we shouldn't be using it anymore.  Y'see, it has this problem where it's a great carbon source...  Contingent evaluations, heh.  Anyway, *my* opinion on coal mining is that it should be clean, modern, and minimal... but is that the actual opinion of the people who live in coal extraction areas?  I don't know.  I've never lived in any such place, nor studied one.

The democratic ethic in coal extraction issue is a little bit uncomfortable for me.  I would want to move the public first, but because I believe that the system as a whole is under terrible strains that aren't being adequately responded to, I would want to move the issue even if I had to move ahead of the public...  Coal policy can only move at the pace of coal-mining regions if the coal-mining regions are very enthusiastic to become other kinds of regions.  It's otherwise a right frowner of an issue.

Mention of Navajo uranium miners not being warned of radiation is kind of a lot more straightforward as an environmental justice issue.  I would expect that affected population resents that way more personally than outside populations resent it.  There isn't really a question over the popularity of bringing regulatory actions against a uranium mining operation that is operating on deception.  Knowing about material extraction risks and not warning your workers is purely appalling conduct.

There are some calculations marked in the book to be performed based on the ecological footprint.  I'm reluctant.  The whole ecological footprint concept feels inappropriately fatalistic.  I can calculate how much over its area the United States is, but I don't think I'd be learning something critical by doing that.  I believe that we need those advanced nations with their big ecological footprints to produce the equipment that is necessary to increasing the carrying capacity of the Earth.  My fantasies about mitochondrial engineering are all about exactly that.  All of my thoughts are more probable because I live in a rich nation that is over its "share" of the burden.  Nor am I alone in this, as environmentalism is broadly more popular in developed rather than developing regions, and so for that matter are scientific endeavors.  Where people have dealt with the immediate concerns of life more comprehensively, they turn their attention towards longer-term investments and the pursuit of more fundamental questions, which is a virtuous process necessary to environmentalism that I think the ecological footprint measure gives the wrong impression about.

Sustainability is certainly a real issue.  Again, as an [[immortalist]] I would rather not live through centuries of environmental privation consequent to some kind of biotech-over-environmentalism strategy... well, actually I would go through that willingly if the way I found myself subject to such environmental privation was by moving to Mars, haha!  Yet if I have to do my work on Earth (I would rather not), I look to the ecology from the [[immortalist]] perspective, and I don't see unsustainable gains as something I can count on indefinitely.

I don't know how much I'm really learning, but I enjoy thinking about this stuff.  Hm, self-test section at the end!  I'll copy that in and try it.

**Testing Your Comprehension**
*How and why did the agricultural revolution affect human population size? How and why did the industrial revolution affect human population size? Explain what benefits and what environmental impacts have resulted.*
The agricultural revolution greatly increased the carrying capacity of human settlements, leading to stable advances in population commensurate with the available nutrient budget.  (The idea of a society expanding until starvation limits it is horrifying...)  The industrial revolution massively increased productivity in all domains and lead to much cleaner cities with much larger structures, leading to ongoing advances in population due to still-ongoing declines in the occurrence of sickness and privation.

*What is an ecological footprint? Explain what is meant by the term overshoot.*
An ecological footprint is the average amount of resources needed to sustain each person in a society, calculated as a land area.  An overshoot is the degree to which a society is pulling on resources in excess of its size.  Ecologists believe that the entire planet has currently overshot its carrying capacity.

*What is environmental science? Name several disciplines that environmental science draws upon.*
Environmental science is an interdisciplinary pursuit pulling together information from other scientific disciplines in order to assemble a fuller picture of the Earth's ecologies and correct management practices applying thereunto.  ...the only disciplines that occur to me right now are geology, chemistry, and meteorology.  I didn't look too closely at the chart, which just seemed to be pulling in everything that occurred to the authors to list.  *reviewing it now*  Are geography and political science actually scientific disciplines?  The full list given is ecology, biology, chemistry, atmospheric science (isn't that meteorology?), oceanography, geology, geography, archaeology, anthropology, history, political science, engineering, economics, and ethics.

*Compare and contrast the two meanings of the term science. Name three applications of science.*
Descriptive science is about cataloguing data and measuring phenomenon.  Hypothesis-driven science attempts to discover causal linkages by testing proposed hypothetical causalities.  I feel inexplicably insulted by being asked to name three applications of science.  I can't fathom why, but I'm just going to skip ahead.

*Describe the scientific method. What is its typical sequence of steps? What needs to occur before a researcher’s results are published? Why is this process important?*
1.  Observe a phenomenon; identify a research target
2.  Ask questions; define information sought
3.  Develop a hypothesis; define a hypothetical answer that would resolve the question in a way fitting the observation
4.  Make predictions; use the hypothetical answer to predict attributes that would then be true about the research target
5.  Test the predictions; define an experiment that observes the predicted attribute of the research target, which can confirm or disprove the hypothesis.
6.  Analyze and interpret results; 

*Compare and contrast anthropocentrism, biocentrism, and ecocentrism. Explain how individuals with each perspective might evaluate the development of a shopping mall atop a wetland in your town or city.*

Differentiate the preservation ethic from the conservation ethic. Explain the contributions of John Muir and Gifford Pinchot in the history of environmental ethics.

Describe Aldo Leopold’s land ethic. How did Leopold define the “community” to which ethical standards should be applied?

Explain the concept of environmental justice. Give an example of an inequity relevant to environmental justice that you believe exists in your city, state, or country.

Describe in your own words what you think is meant by the term sustainability. Name three ways that students, faculty, or administrators are seeking to make their campuses more sustainable.

I think I've done as much here as I will.  I need to keep moving.  The book is being taught in an odd nonlinear order, so the next chapter will be chapter 14.  While I'm here though, it looks like chapter 2 won't be part of the notes, and at the start of the chapter 2 there's a story about how the Chesapeake Bay oyster fisheries collapsed.  The cause of the fishery collapse is cited as the development of hypoxygenated dead zones in critical oyster fields.  Why don't the fisheries just build aeration rigs to regulate the oxygen levels in key oyster beds?  It seems like a form of aquacultural irrigation that could increase the reliability of yields.  It should do no harm to the ecologies of the areas either, given the way resource-poor aquatic environments tend to flourish when given the resources of life (such as extra oxygen).

Humanity's idea of its own planet's carrying capacity has been based on bad ideas again and again...  It's frustrating.  Humans suck.
