The purpose of strength is to avert conflict with people who think that strength has purposes other than averting conflict.

I made some mint chocolate carnauba wax candies.  They set pretty much instantly on being removed from heat; indeed, my boiler is now a mess, and I hope I haven't ruined it.  I got to try some fresh and hot.  The flavor was of mint, semi-dark chocolate, and... carnauba wax.  I like them overall, though the carnauba wax is not the most desirable distinction.

I would rather have used beeswax, but sawing off a chunk of beeswax to cook with it created a mess that was hard to clean up.  I've ordered a chisel.  A guide I found online suggests that the correct way to section beeswax for cooking involves a hammer and chisel.

I'm afraid I'll do some violence to my intestines this way, but I'm hoping that in moderate quantities, eating wax will mitigate appetite.

I used mint liquor to flavor them, but I boiled off the liquor early this time, and the resulting candies taste like mint, *not* alcohol.  So that worked!  I'll remember it.
