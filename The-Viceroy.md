# The-Viceroy

The Viceroy is an interesting under-appreciated gem I recently had the fortune of discovering on Steam.  It's about managing a region of stellar economy.  The game's simulation is easy to "cheese" and maximize, but maximizing it may not be ideal.  It looks like the game has a lot of hidden substates implied by its narrative, many of which are worth exploring precisely.  Tuning into these substates requires approaching the game as a Beyonder, and manipulating the probability wave of the region to develop precisely.

The simulation and the narrative of the game both reward some amount of calculating evaluation.  The way that the game's narrative in particular tends to reward precise and contemplative gameplay is fascinating, but doesn't appear to have been noticed as a feature.
