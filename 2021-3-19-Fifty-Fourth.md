I've started my day with a peanut butter keto cookie.  This is not a violation of my 'fasting'; this is part of my diet.  I allot myself four hundred calories under a ketogenic rule.  That's what I consider 'fasting'.  Today I plan to keep the fast faithfully, as I define it.

This is the first of my fast-whining entries.  I intend to complain about hunger pangs and bemoan the food I *wish* I could eat.  For the rest of the duration of this current fast, I'll try to direct myself to whinge, moan, and complain in this space.

I'm in exam season at school.  I'm not too stressed.  The difficulty level isn't too high.

Online courses are unfortunately still lacking something.  I tried business courses online, and that feels useless.  Organizational study requires working individually with other people, which is where online courses are weakest.  I also tried chemistry courses online, and the problem there is that they are *all* laboratory courses.  I don't feel like the available "laboratory simulation" material would teach me to actually work in a lab.  At least math courses are unimpaired by distance learning.

There's a one credit course offering about studying socially; I considered taking it, but I doubt that it could teach me to overcome this deficit of online education.  I feel like the college experience really ought to have me living on or near the campus.  This is most true about business studies.

The classes that suffer most from distance learning would be much better if they were taught in a sufficiently developed virtual reality.  The level of sufficient development would vary per class.  Business classes might require less virtual reality development than chemistry classes to achieve sufficient development, because the chemistry classes would need very fine controls (glove-based, I would hope!) and a chemistry simulation model, whereas the business classes should only need a sufficiently good telepresence environment.  Next-gen telepresence will be better than current materials.

In the category of bemoaning foods I wish I could eat...

My favorite kind of burger is a double bacon sourdough burger from the local Herfy's Burgers.  It's a grease-bomb, with sodden flat sourdough pieces, and I can't make it sound as good as it tastes to me.  The bacon sourdough burgers from Jack in the Box are similar, but less excellent.  I used to eat triple bacon sourdough burgers from Herfy's, but those were always stacked too high to be entirely practical, and eventually they just struck me as inconvenient and silly.  It's hard to eat that.  Reaching in the other direction, going down to the single bacon sourdough loses something in the whole texture of the sandwich.

I think Herfy's just cooks grocery store fries in their frier, but my experience at that site is that the staff there have consistently turned out *perfect* frier use.  I don't know how deep fat friers work, so I don't know what *perfect* is, but the fried foods there are way better than at any other local restaurant.  I'm guessing that means everything they fry is fried for exactly the right time at exactly the right temperature.  My favorite is their waffle fries, but they have a broad fried foods menu.  They sell fried pickles as well, and those are delicious.

I haven't eaten at Herfy's for a long time.  Where do grease bomb burgers and perfect fried foods fit into a weight loss plan?  They don't.  I can only lament that.

They're a local family business, and I hope they do well.  Herfy's is the kind of restaurant I'd love to see survive into the age where we can digitize experiences and share them without paying pricetags in health.

Yesterday I found a new method of exercise which may be worth taking note of: integrating dragon porn into the routine.  The thought I had was that exercise is very much limited by pain tolerance... and something I knew from the bad old days (which I was thinking about yesterday) is that arousal increases pain tolerance.  Chronic pain was one of the original reasons I found for being tolerant of sexuality, because being aroused offers pain relief.

Well, I'm pretty sore today, so I'd say it worked.

I recently finished some delicious cherry-amaretto THC edibles.  THC edibles often taste terrible, but these ones were very good.

...I am undirected today, and no, I'm not presently high.  I'm tempted to say, "Well, today is a weekend," on the basis that my classes pack work into Sunday (and have done so this Sunday as well), whereas today I have no tests nor imminently due homework.  Yet that doesn't mean I *want* to do nothing all day, just that my immediate plans won't be altered if I do nothing all day.

I wonder if exercise soreness is impairing my motivation, and I'm going to go try caffeinating myself.

Reading about ocean acidification, I found myself thinking, "Is there any such thing as an algae species that promotes alkaline conditions?"  This thought is not valuable of itself, but may be a helpful one for ecosystem engineering more broadly.  Living things alter the PH balance of their environment as they live.  Do any of them alkalize their environment?

Would that just result in the ocean frothing up its dissolved CO2?  Tch.  Probably better to focus on algae engineering for pure carbon sinkage.  My meteorology textbook says that promoting algae blooms does nothing to stop ocean acidification of itself, but that's not true.  Dead microorganisms in the water column sink, carrying carbon away from the surface, and what settles to the ocean floor isn't contributing to the acidification of the surface waters AFAIK.

Here's a thought:  Build some ocean pipes off the coast of Peru to aerate the water where El Nino occasionally causes fish die-offs.  That could save coral from bleaching and reduce misery in the region from disease and adverse weather.

Kistaro has recommended that, to mitigate the basic intolerability of Huel, I may wish to alternate weeks where I consume only Huel, with weeks where I consume no food at all.  Since I did lose a pound on the week where I most faithfully ate only Huel, and I lost that pound without being hungry all the time, I'll give it a try.  Next week, I'll eat Huel instead of fasting completely.

I had similar effects from Soylent.  If I really consumed only Soylent, my appetite declined to something healthier, and I could lose weight without going hungry.  Yet Soylent suffers cumulative intolerability; the more Soylent I drank, the less I wanted to drink any Soylent at all.  Huel does that, too.  The more of it I consume, the less I want to have any more of it.  I'd say Huel is slightly better than Soylent, so I'm far from done experimenting with it.  Maybe if I switch weeks in a structured way, cumulative intolerability won't hit me that hard.

While I'm talking about it, most of the Huel was too bland.  It was like trying to live on an oatmeal diet.  In this respect, the peanut butter Huel stood out from the pack as being *too rich*.  The more I could mix it to a perfectly even consistency, the more it became like drinking a peanut butter shake.  Unfortunately, that didn't make the peanut butter Huel do any better for cumulative intolerability.  I like peanut butter shakes, but rarely.

I need to get rid of my old, expired stocks of Soylent... and maybe reorder some of the mint ones.  Only a small amount, though.  Soylent mint could be a snack option.  It's not something I want to base a diet on.

Oh, but I can't bring up Huel without mentioning that they REALLY need to improve their Chocolate formula.  Their chocolate flavoring verges on disgusting, and it affects both the powders and the food bars.  None of their other flavors are so bad.  So anyone who is curious about Huel should really try some other flavor first...  I recommend the Salted Caramel.
