I've started my day with a peanut butter keto cookie.  This is not a violation of my 'fasting'; this is part of my diet.  I allot myself four hundred calories under a ketogenic rule.  That's what I consider 'fasting'.  Today I plan to keep the fast faithfully, as I define it.

This is the first of my fast-whining entries.  I intend to complain about hunger pangs and bemoan the food I *wish* I could eat.  For the rest of the duration of this current fast, I'll try to direct myself to whinge, moan, and complain in this space.

I'm in exam season at school.  I'm not too stressed.  The difficulty level isn't too high.

Online courses are unfortunately still lacking something.  I tried business courses online, and that feels useless.  Organizational study requires working individually with other people, which is where online courses are weakest.  I also tried chemistry courses online, and the problem there is that they are *all* laboratory courses.  I don't feel like the available "laboratory simulation" material would teach me to actually work in a lab.  At least math courses are unimpaired by distance learning.

There's a one credit course offering about studying socially; I considered taking it, but I doubt that it could teach me to overcome this deficit of online education.  I feel like the college experience really ought to have me living on or near the campus.  This is most true about business studies.

The classes that suffer most from distance learning would be much better if they were taught in a sufficiently developed virtual reality.  The level of sufficient development would vary per class.  Business classes might require less virtual reality development than chemistry classes to achieve sufficient development, because the chemistry classes would need very fine controls (glove-based, I would hope!) and a chemistry simulation model, whereas the business classes should only need a sufficiently good telepresence environment.  Next-gen telepresence will be better than current materials.

In the category of bemoaning foods I wish I could eat...

My favorite kind of burger is a double bacon sourdough burger from the local Herfy's Burgers.  It's a grease-bomb, with sodden flat sourdough pieces, and I can't make it sound as good as it tastes to me.  The bacon sourdough burgers from Jack in the Box are similar, but less excellent.  I used to eat triple bacon sourdough burgers from Herfy's, but those were always stacked too high to be entirely practical, and eventually they just struck me as inconvenient and silly.  It's hard to eat that.  Reaching in the other direction, going down to the single bacon sourdough loses something in the whole texture of the sandwich.

I think Herfy's just cooks grocery store fries in their frier, but my experience at that site is that the staff there have consistently turned out *perfect* frier use.  I don't know how deep fat friers work, so I don't know what *perfect* is, but the fried foods there are way better than at any other local restaurant.  I'm guessing that means everything they fry is fried for exactly the right time at exactly the right temperature.  My favorite is their waffle fries, but they have a broad fried foods menu.  They sell fried pickles as well, and those are delicious.

I haven't eaten at Herfy's for a long time.  Where do grease bomb burgers and perfect fried foods fit into a weight loss plan?  They don't.  I can only lament that.

They're a local family business, and I hope they do well.  Herfy's is the kind of restaurant I'd love to see survive into the age where we can digitize experiences and share them without paying pricetags in health.
