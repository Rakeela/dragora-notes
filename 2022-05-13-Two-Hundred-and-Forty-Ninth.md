I fell asleep after struggling to study a math problem, and unusually enough, I actually dreamed of math.  Yet the dream lead me to a realization, and not a useful one, but rather I observed that the dream used math only as a narrative element.  The math problem was a menace unconquerable rather than something that could be analyzed, and so I realized (or thought I realized) that my subconscious can't do math.

What a disability if so!
