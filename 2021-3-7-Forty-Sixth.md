I've just gone a sleepless night courtesy of drinking an unexpectedly and VERY caffeinated beverage around the time I had been planning to go to bed.  I may've gotten something done, although certainly it's unlikely to be acknowledged anywhere that I did anything but complain in a suspicious place.  I'd be willing to explain, but the explanation would be very difficult; the details are in any case attested across the archive, or else they will be as I add to it!

People don't seem to understand that there's a lot of pleasure in trying to do the right thing.  They're beaten down by something.

I've had a geo-engineering thought based on my textbook in environmental science that I'd like to share.  It mentions PM 2.5 pollution on page 299, describing air pollution as potentially contributing to dementia.  This suggests to me that sulfate aerosols may be unsuitable for geo-engineering, due to the risk of distributing brain damage across the population.
