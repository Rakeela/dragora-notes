Panarchic Courts are a technology humanity already has.  The Viceroy is not a good game mechanically, but it's a beautiful game ideologically.  It's a monument that'll stand for a while in that sense.  I still think about it.  Panarchic Courts are one of the things I think about, because I think they're right at the brink of something the game's ideological model gets right, and right at the brink of something the game's ideological model gets wrong.

Panarchic Courts are the prerequisite technology to Voluntary Order, a Panarchic technology that promotes the happiness of people.  If you flood a system with arbitrators who try to resolve every conflict throughout it and create a system of justice that meets the needs of ALL parties, you create the conditions for people to come to order with each other in the absence of all authority.

Ultimately, the Panarchic Court is something humanity tries to achieve, though it's... inconstant and poorly recognized.  In the real world, we don't have access to galactic negotiators who have experience of doing this on many worlds, and the techniques of achieving such a system are not... catalogued.  I agree with the Panarchic Courts themselves as being a +Influence technology that would not actually make people happy, but I think it should *lead* to something that would make people happy.  A society that can construct and catalogue such methods should be able to carry them forward into a system of social contract that would make them much happier.

The Panarchy is... diverse.  Exactly what form a voluntarily ordered society would take is likely to be idiosyncratic.  Not all people would be happy with any particular system of voluntary order.  Nevertheless, from the broad contact of arbitration and analysis that the Panarchic Courts enable, it should be possible to figure out the idiosyncratic preferences of each particular grouping of people, thereby to implement something that will give them a strong and functional will to embrace their own natures and live with greater confidence in their way of life.  That's what Panarchic technologies are about: cultural majesty.  Voluntary Order is a technology of culture that makes people happier when it is achieved.

...but The Viceroy doesn't have Voluntary Order in its tech tree.  The Panarchic Courts extend only into the misspelled "Panarchic Capital" and the "Panarchic Palaces"...  Palaces are actually quite a good technology for investing in a society's ability to build up a base of both analysis and culture, but the Panarchic Capital technology is one of the clearest weaknesses in The Viceroy's system of ideology.  Right in that slot is where the game's developers should've put Voluntary Order, a +Happiness tech of the Panarchy.

Humanity reaches towards voluntary order, but it doesn't know what it reaches for just yet.  We have the Panarchic Courts, but they're not fully understood.  We have not yet achieved voluntary order.

My project to record ideological thoughts on The Viceroy within their own section of my archive...  I just... feel a bit more demoralized about that specifically right now, so this is going here instead.  I can't modify the game in the specific ways that I most believe it needs to be modified, and that makes it draining to play.  This happens to a lot of games that I invest too much thought in.  Eventually, they're not appropriate anymore.  They don't 'fit'.

Some games would in theory let me modify them to fit, and I have 'no excuse', though my skills are not strong in that.  This one is well-wrapped and opaque; I have analyzed the behavior of its system and found many anomalies in its supposedly straightforward math.  The game is designed as far as I can tell to be outright hostile and hateful... to anyone who would analyze it.  I believe it bakes in a belief in the virtue of the Commonwealth as well... but the Nazis were Commonwealth.  Humanity has *tried* the natalist/nationalist ideology that protects the happiness of its folk with an all-powerful state... but the Hitler Youth were not really a great innovation in child welfare, and genocide was no technology at all.

Reason favors the Panarchy, and I think ultimately the Panarchic Ritualists.  This is the conclusion that I'm "not supposed" to draw, but it's the ideology that breaks up warring nations most completely, and frees humanity to study its errors so that it can advance.  The Panarchic Ritualists have the best administrators of all the factions in a game about society collapsing for lack of good administrative talent.  I understand that I'm "supposed to" think they abuse their kids... but the Hitler Youth were not really a great innovation in child welfare, and genocide was no technology at all.  Do you see how that applies?

Society needs the integrity to continue striving for voluntary order, without violating each other obsessively on the idea that anyone not sufficiently violated might be a criminal.  A true system of enlightened policing would not be one that catches every crook, but rather would be a system that punishes no innocent, wherein the state's police are no longer a source of harm in society.
