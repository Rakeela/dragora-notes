# Senescent Cells

AKA zombie cells, senescent cells are cells that have aged into malfunction without properly apoptosing for the body to replace them.  Very few of these are still doing anything useful, and it's generally more correct for the immune system to clear them out than to leave them be.  Unfortunately, the immune system is bad at that.

Drugs called senolytics are preferentially toxic to senescent cells, and are believed to improve longevity.  More effective senolytic methods are being sought by researchers.  I am not presently taking on this project, but I recommend analyzing the surface proteins of senescent cells for unique self-antigen targets which can be programmed into an RNA vaccine to improve the immune system's handling of senescent cells.
