Morning weigh-in:  254.1 pounds.

I had a really good dream that turned into a terrible dream at the end, that left me waking up in an awful mood completely demoralized about fasting.  So I'm starting my week with a cookie and some sushi.  That'll be all I eat today, theoretically.  Let's see if can handle that.

Well, I ate a parm crisp... and dropped the rest of the box on the floor.  Oops.  That's kind of a pricey snack to just lose all of.  So I went out to Trader Joe's hoping they'd have *cheaper* parm crisps.  They do not.  They do however have black truffle baked cheese snacks.  They're delicious and they have 0 carbs.  I bought both black truffle and regular in case I didn't like the black truffle, but knowing what it actually tastes like, I think I would've rather bought two of the black truffle.

Cheese snacks!  Zero carb.  Unlikely to cause an insulin response.
