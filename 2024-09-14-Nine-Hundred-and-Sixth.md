6:53.  Managed to get up somewhat early this time.

7:27.  Okay, 

7:29.  Okay, time to work.  14,738.  Thirty.

10:31.  16,903.  Taking a break.

14:23.  I forgot to mark when I came back from my earlier break.  20,127.  5,389 words of progress.

15:11.  20,485.  5,747 words of progress.

15:14.  20,508.

17:48.  I lost my treadmill use, but I think I had seven hours and forty eight minutes.

19:39.  Done with TTRPG stuff.  Finally.  That session left me feeling sad.

20:27.  Stuck.  Mentally.  I'm just sad.  I'm less sad than I was, but I'm still sad.  I guess I can't be 'stuck' when I can observe change over time in how I feel?  It's pretty slow though.  I'm riding a slow gradient of sadness in the direction of normality.

21:01.  See, now I'm laughing.  The gradient continued.  I gradually felt better until I was cheerful again.

21:39.  21,015.  6,277.  Showertime.

(This part added the next day.)  I walked an additional hour and a half.  2.0 miles.  349 kcal.  7,266 steps.  1 hour, 29 minutes, and 50 seconds.  1.3 mph.  And, for once, I was super-comfortable when I laid down in bed.  It wasn't, like, the comfiest I have ever been while trying to sleep, but it was really pleasant.
