Carbohydrates are a major source of energy from our diet.  They are made from the elements C, H, and O.  They are also called saccharides, which means "sugars".

Carbohydrates, such as glucose, are produced by photosynthesis in plants.  They are syntheesized in plants from CO2, H2O, and energy from the sun.  They are oxidized in living cells to produce CO2, H2O, and energy.  (The example is given of - not recorded in time.)

The types of carbohydrates are:
 * Monosaccharides, the simplest carbohydrates
 * disaccharides, which consist of two monosaccharides
 * polysaccharides, which contain many monosaccharides

Monosaccharides contain several hydroxyl groups attached to a chain of 3 to 8 carbon atoms.  If they contain an aldehyde group they are classified as an aldose.  If they contain a ketone group they are classified as a ketose.  They have hydroxyl groups on all carbons except the carbonyl carbon.

Monosaccharides are also classified by the number of carbon atoms present.  Triose is 3 carbons.  Tetrose is 4 carbons.  Pentose is 5 carbons.  Hexose is 6 carbons.  An aldopentose is a five carbon saccharide with an aldehyde group.  A ketohexose is a six-carbon saccharide with a ketone group.

(An example slide is given displaying the condensed structural formulas of glyceraldehyde aka aldotriose, threose aka aldotetrose, ribose aka aldopentose, and fructose aka ketohexose.)

Glucose, galactose, and fructose are the most important monosaccharides.  (Commentary:Remember that D-enantiomers are defined by the -OH group farthest from the carbonyl group being on the right, whereas L-enantiomers are defined by the -OH group farthest from the carbonyl group being on the left.)

A Fischer projection, used to represent carbohydrates, places the aldehyde group (most oxidized) at the top.  It shows the -H and -OH groups on the horizontal intersecting line.  The achiral -CH2OH group is at the bottom.  (An example is given contrasting L-glyceraldyhde with D-glyceraldehyde.)

In a Fischer projection, the -OH group on the chiral carbon farthest from the carbonyl group determines an L or D isomer.  Left is assigned the letter L and right is assigned the letter D.  (An example is given contrasting L-glucose with D-glucose.)

D-glucose, d-galactose, and d-fructose are the most important monosaccharides.  They are all hexoses with the molecular formula C6H12O6 and are isomers of each other.  (An example is given contrasting d-glucose with d-galactose and d-fructose.)

D-glucose is the most common aldohexose.  It is found in fruits, vegetables, corn syrup, and honey.  It's also known as dextrose and blood sugar in the body.  It is a building block of the disaccharides sucrose, lactose, and of polysaccharides such as cellulose and glycogen.

D-galactose, an aldohexose with the formula C6H12O6, is obtained from the disaccharide lactose, found in milk.  It's important in the cellular membranes of the brain and nervous system.

In a condition called galactosemia, the enzyme needed to convert d-galactose to d-glucose is missing.  Galactose then accumulates in the blood and tissue, which can lead to cataracts, mental retardation, failure to thrive, and liver disease.

D-fructose is a ketohexose with the formula C6H12O6.  It is the sweetest of the carbohydrates, twice as sweet as sucrose (table sugar).  It is obtained as one of the hydrolysis products of sucrose.  High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener that is produced by using an enzyme to break down sucrose to glucose and fructose.

In the body, glucose has a normal blood level of 70-90 mg/dL.  A glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose for several hours after ingesting glucose.  (A graph is given contrasting hyperglycemia, normal, and hypoglycemia.)

Diabetes mellitus can cause hyperglycemia, which occurs when the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient quantities of insulin.  It allows glucose levels in the body fluids to rise as high as 350 mg/dL of plasma.  Symptoms of diabetes include thirst and excessive urination, increased appetite and weight loss, high level of glucose in the urine, which can be identified using Benedict's test.

When a person is hypoglycemic the blood glucose level rises and then decreases rapidly to levels as low as 40 mg/dL.  Low blood sugar may occur as a result of an overproduction of insulin by the pancreas.  Symptoms such as dizziness, general weakness, and muscle tremors may appear.  A diet may be prescribed that consists of several small meals high in protein and low in carbohydrates.
