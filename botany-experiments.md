1. Do different plants vary in the reliance of their metabolism on the iron content available to them?  Iron rich vs iron poor soil of otherwise similar quality could be utilized to test the growth of plants of three different varieties.  That should give a good first attempt at answering this.

2. What determines the iron reliance of different plants?  I found myself thinking about iron metabolism of plants when my thoughts managed to cross the topics of the Martian soil with genetic engineering of plants.  Mars is covered in rust, isn't it?  Can plants be engineered to perform best in ferrous soil?

3. Do different plants vary in their iron extraction rate from the soil?  If iron content in the soil varies measurably after growing a crop, that may be usable for information about which crops are most iron-hungry.  Very iron-hungry plants may be good at concentrating iron in a nutritionally accessible form, although they may also deplete accessible iron in soils.  Testing crops for this may yield candidates for potential rust competency.

4. Do plant chelating chemicals vary in their ability to absorb iron oxide?  I believe rust dissolves readily in some chellating agents, but I don't know whether any of those exist among plants.  A plant with superior iron chellation should be advantaged in many of the soils of Earth, as well as being more easily grown on Mars.  I would like to find a comprehensive list of phytochemicals known to have a chelating effect in plant metabolism.  If the presence of those phytochemicals can be linked to specific genes or geneplexes, it may be possible to engineer transgenic plants which chellate iron exceptionally well.

5. Do plants vary in the acidity of their root structures?  Test fields growing different plants could answer this.  If root acidity is a distinct variable itself, I think this may be helpful in identifying rust-competent plants.  This may be a dead target if the maximal plant acidity is not sufficient to impact its iron absorption, though it should be nevertheless be revisited with transgenic variants to see if root acidity is a controllable variable.
   
6. Is it possible to make a plant that concentrates economic quantities of iron when grown in rust?  This is a silly sci-fi question rather than a proposal which could be answered with test fields, but I decided to include it in the list.


Disclaimer:  I may refile this if I come up with more general botany experiments.  Also, none of this accounts for the peroxide content of Martian soils, nor any other feature of it.  These experiments would be more likely to yield results applicable to Earth than results applicable to Mars.
