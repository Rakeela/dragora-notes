#Chem131-17-7-CellMembranes

(Commentary:  This wasn't given in-class, so I can't assign a date to it.  I'm transcribing the slides on my own to study the mateiral.)

Substances are transported across a cell membrane by either diffusion, facilitated transport, or active transport.  (An image is given depicting red, yellow, and blue dots using the three kinds of transport across a cell membrane.)  Learning Goal: Describe the composition and function of the lipid bilayer in cell membranes.

Cell membranes are semipermeable so that nutrients can enter the cell and waste products can leave.  They separate cellular contents from the extracellular environment.  They consist of a lipid bilayer made of two rows of phospholipids.  They have an inner portion made of the nonpolar tails of the phospholipids, with the polar heads at the outer and inner surfaces.

Structure and Polarity of a Glycerophospholipid:  (a) The components of a typical glycerophospholipid: an amino alcohol, phosphoric acid, glycerol, and two fatty acids. (b) In a glycerophospholipid, a polar "head" contains the ionized amino alcohol and phosphate, while the hydrocarbon chains of two fatty acids make up the nonpolar "tails".  (c) A simplified drawing indicates the polar region and the nonpolar region. (A condensed structural formula of a glycerophospholipid is given.  The simplified drawing in (c) is also given.)

In the fluid mosaic model of a cell membrane, proteins and cholesterol are embedded in a lipid bilayer of phospholipids.  The bilayer forms a membrane-type barrier with polar heads at the membrane surfaces and the nonpolar tails in the center, away from the water.

The lipid bilayer contains phospholipids with unsaturated fatty acids with kinks in the carbon chains.  It contains proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol molecules.  It is not a rigid, fixed structure, but one that is dynamic and fluid-like.  It has proteins and carbohydrates on the surface that communicate with hormones and neurotransmitters.

The transport of substances through cell membranes involves
	1. diffusion (passive transport), which moves particles from a higher to a lower concentration.
	2. facilitated transport, which uses protein channels to increase the rate of diffusion
	3. active transport, which moves ions against a concentration gradient

(The image from the first slide is given again.)  Substances are transported across a cell membrane by diffusion (passive) transport, facilitated transport, or active transport.
