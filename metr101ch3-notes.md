# Metr101Ch3 Notes

I'm opening this file to help myself focus on studying.  I'm proceeding at the work in a pace that is adequate for the necessary minimum engagement with all of my classes.  While tolerable, that is not ideal.  I may not intend to get into Meteorology, but that doesn't mean I don't have anything to gain from the course.  For instance, I'm fascinated by the way my environmental sciences and meteorology courses both talk about energy budgets.  I think that if I could calculate more of the energy budgets involved, I would have a better ability to define weather control experiments on Earth.  I truly believe that humanity will be able to control the weather someday - in fact, I see technologies used by farmers to control orchard temperatures as prototypical examples of how humans can understand energy mixture through air in open environments well enough to achieve targeted outcomes.

Chapter 3 is all about temperature.  I'm seized somewhat by the poetry of it.  The sun's rays soak into the ocean of our atmosphere, inducing whorls and currents around features that re-emit their warmth.  Imagine that a sea of golden glitter shared the air with us and let us watch the temperature flows move across the landscape.  The clouds and mountains are sources of sparkling chaos in this system.  Here a depression in the land channels cold air, and there a dry dark soil produces powerful thermals rising through the air in a glittering column, while far overhead great near-perpetual windstreams level out the temperature differences across the planet.

Humanity builds such large structures.  Why have we built no mountains of our own?  We could trap warmth and moisture where we need them to stop desertification.  Similar tricks of temperature management would exist if we made more willful use of water bodies as thermal storage.  The influence of large water bodies is presented in the text as inherently mediatory.  They soften the extremes of winters and summers.  If there are communities that suffer from extreme weather conditions, especially extreme weather conditions associated with extreme points in seasonal variations, do these problems strike from predictable directions?  If so, can we dig deep lakes between these communities and the recurrent weather systems that savage them?  That buffer might return a lot of value in some areas.  Putting that much effort into restore water to the biosphere might help fend off regional aridification, too...

These are great thoughts, but I don't see the math here.  I wonder how I'd find it out...   I get such a strong sense from this coursework that it's calculable.  It'd be awesome if I could define a procedure with supportive mathematics for an appropriately scaled test experiment using naval mirror-drones to try to alter precipitation in nearby coastal areas...

Homework asks a question about isotherms, I don't remember seeing that in the text...  I know what it is; it's a contour line on a meteorological map denotating areas of equivalent temperature.  Yet I missed it in the text here.  Honestly, reading is a frustrating experience in recent years.  In youth, I was able to look at every single word, without skipping anything or slowing down.  In my attempts to accelerate my reading pace lately, I've been struggling with a scattering tendency to look all over the page rather than engage in focused rapid sequential reading.  Skimming feels fast, but it's not.  If you want to maximize recall, getting there by skimming the text repeatedly is actually quite slow.  Impatience slows down digestion of texts.  I'm still patient in social contexts, but I'm not patient with books anymore, and that's frustrating.  I swear I'm not making a willful decision to read in a less efficient manner.
