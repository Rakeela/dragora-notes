#2022-12-08-Three-Hundred-and-Seventh

Starting today with a blank file and a quota of 874 words.

608 words on the file.  266 words remaining.  This was going well for the first four hundred words, but then I slowed down sharply.

I'm deleting two words (and changing one) from files I wrote during nanowrimo, but I'm not going to count it against my writing progress today.

Taking the previous file from 540 to 585, +45 words of progress.

1,302 words on the file.  1,347 words of progress.

1,305 words on the file.  I went back after I'd finished, and I changed a line.
