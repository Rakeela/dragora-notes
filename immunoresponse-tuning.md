#immunoresponse-tuning

One of the categories of immunosenescence is accumulated error in the immune system.  The immune system is an adaptive, learning system that accumulates its understanding of how to recognize and respond to pathogens over the course of the entire lifetime.  However, due to thermodynamically improbable interactions, it has some rate of inaccurately recognizing self-proteins as pathogen-associated molecular patterns.  These events famously create autoimmunity disorders, but I believe they are more inevitable than generally understood.  I believe that erroneous pathogen recognition creates disorders of persistent inflammation as well as (some fraction of) the weakening of the immune system with age.

Some method is needed to overcome mislearning in the immune system in order for lifespans to be indefinitely extended, as life extension in the absence of methods to detrain the immune system will lead to the inevitable accretion of autoimmune disorders in all individuals of extended lifespan.  The development of these tools to overcome mislearning are the bulk of what I consider immunoresponse tuning.

Vaccines are also a form of immunoresponse tuning, but it's notably easier to teach the immune system to recognize a pathogen, than it is to teach the immune system to stop targeting an inaccurately identified self-protein.
