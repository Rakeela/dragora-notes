I got up early, but I went back to sleep after a while.  I haven't mastered this whole "staying awake in the morning" thing yet.  Nor have I mastered "getting to work promptly", which is odd because I had it down a while back.

17:43.  39,896.

18:34.  40,473.  577 words of progress.  Ugh.  I'm being so uninspired.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm going to stop a moment.  I'm not sure how much I'll get done tonight.
