I know why I'll never kill myself: because I was sexually exploited.  It actually happened, I actually got stalked by people who treated me as lying about it, I'll always be treated as lying about it, and I'm almost powerless to find anyone sympathetic to me.  I'm still powerless to people who took the side of my abusers, and those people to whom I'm powerless would rather I killed myself.  That's why I never will.

My commitment to living forever is one of the only things that I can do to strike back against people whose defense of "integrity" is false in my case.
