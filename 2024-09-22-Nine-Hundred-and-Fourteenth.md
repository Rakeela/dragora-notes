6:03.  Reading about urban planning to see if I can come up with something for what I'm writing.

6:12.  53,838.

6:45.  54,000.  This is difficult.  I'm going to take a walk.  Back soon.

7:04.  Back to work.

10:23.  55,502.  So tired.

10:51.  55,701.

11:17.  55,931.  Sooooo tired.  Resting a moment.

13:33.  57,895.  I didn't mark when I went back to work from my earlier rest, but resting felt really effective this time.  4,057 words of progress.

13:36.  I'm going to stop for a while.  Possibly for the whole day.  I don't know.  I feel okay, but I want to do something else.

13:37.  The emotions in my story are affecting my emotions.

20:51.  I feel sick and weak.  My muscles aren't working right.
