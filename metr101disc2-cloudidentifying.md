# Metr101disc2 Cloud Identifying

Identifying Clouds in your Area
First post due Jan 14; Reply post due Jan 17
I need to take a cloud picture with a date, time, and a city/state/region amount of location data.  I should build a station model of the weather as of the picture being taken, classify the cloud in the picture by its shape and estimated height, and then attempt to estimate whether the cloud indicates current or near-future weather conditions.

This task seems complex enough to need to record further information about, particularly that final step of gauging the weather based on the observed cloud.  I don't feel up to doing this today, and will presently intend to do it tomorrow, though I may do it this evening instead.

Observing the sky outside, it's just pure white across the sky.  I'm not sure what to report, or what distinguishable features might be perceived in that.
