I sometimes think about something that I think society needs: cuddly porn.  Something that presents a society where sexuality is less emotionally difficult for people.  I never figured out what would *make* sexuality less emotionally difficult for people.  When I complained about the emotional difficulty of sex as a teenager and young adult, I was treated (since I'm AMAB and therefore a revolting whore) as demanding that sex be made easier and more available.  I kind of meant that I didn't want it.  I did various things to be less appealing... this thought is digressing.

I think humanity needs some way to make an inviting sexuality that isn't terrifying or abrasive.   I started out cuddly and got less cuddly over time interfacing with online sexuality.  I wasn't to find anything degrading.  I wasn't to be dreary to the mood.  I was supposed to take it easy.

I pulled back.  Continuing to fail to understand my complaints, people thought I was pulling towards a sexuality that fetishized cumshots alone.  Trying that was the ultimate unappealing thing that let me break free...  It was the culmination of pulling back.  I didn't want that at all.  I wanted the original cuddliness, more.  I just couldn't trust people as much.  That took a lot of trust.

I think that's missing from a lot of sexuality.  I think the desire for anonymous sex is the product of having had the trust savaged out of a person.  Where's the high-trust porn?  I've seen a little of it.  Some of the bondage stuff reaches back towards it.  Trust exercises.  Negotiated boundaries.  It's like the hard yet healing side.  I appreciate it conceptually yet I couldn't really get into it.

If I can have my privacy back someday, maybe I should add Swaivshon porn to the list of things I could make.  Fluffy dragon porn.  I imagine their society as cuddly and high-trust.  It could dip into bondage, too.  I appreciate it for this, even if it's not quite my thing.  String together something in Twine that has a character joining a Swaivshon community.
