I'm stressed to hell taking insight from where I don't want to take it and I'm freaking out about an environmental sciences exam.  I have a procedure for this which has gotten me through prior exam stresses, and it's called "order fast food".  So I'm breaking my streak of successful 5-day fasts by making this week a wobbly one...  assuming I can get delivery in a snowstorm, which I might not.

I love the snow, by the way.  I wouldn't rather have a snowstorm than a good grade, but it *is* a comfort on a stressful day, and I'd totally rather have a snowstorm than successfully delivered fast food.  I'm not throwing shade on the snowfall here.  I love watching it accumulate.
