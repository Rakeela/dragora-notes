10:39.  I woke up at 9 AM and hopped on the treadmill pretty quickly.  I've already walked an hour and a half.  I've been working with a game group that I'm trying to assemble a game of Kingdom with.  My character Delvikerronax is a geneticist with brain implants who lives in a slum, saving money to buy implant upgrades and immersive experience chips.  All the characters are dragons with exaggeratedly long names.  It's an independent "democratic" citystate of dragons, but the city is really operated by a company called Hyperpulse Media.  There are other companies in the town, too.  It's to be a cyberpunk game.

11:18.  88,498 words on the file.  I don't know how I'll conclude the story in 1,500 words.  I don't think I will... but I wonder if I can do it in 2,500 words, which would be close enough.  Probably not.  I'm maybe 4,000 words from the end.  I'll have to do a trim pass to get the story closer to 90k.

14:23.  92,242 words on the file.  3,744 words of progress.  Writing an epilogue was really enjoyable.

14:24.  92,250 words on the file.  3,752 words of progress.  Draft complete.  This is the second draft of Ekis' Travelogue.

14:49.  92,250 words on the file.  I've edited it a bit.  Trimmed a few things, expanded a few things.  On balance, no change to the word count.  This word count is still too long.

15:44.  I'm under 230 pounds again!  It's been a while.  I was stuck at 240 as a plateau, and now I weigh less than 230.  When I get under 222 pounds, I'll be really breaking new ground at my lowest adult weight.  My goal: 180 pounds.  I still remember the day that I first weighed myself and saw the scale read above 180.  I thought, "I'm never going to weigh less than 180 pounds again."  I want to prove that thought to have been in error.

16:42.  I feel like I should delete my current "fast" when the timer hits.  I was eating in a regular, light fashion throughout.  I wasn't spending the whole time in solid ketosis like the app reports.  On the other hand, if I keep the record, it will encourage me to set even longer records next time.

16:46.  Arguably I wasn't eating regularly.  I was eating once a day.  That still results in a considerable amount of ketosis... but less than the app will report.

20:54.  I've handed over Draft 2 to my pre-readers and I'm starting on Draft 3.  The events of Draft 2 should stand.  Now I need to trim the material extensively to prepare it.  Instead of aiming for a quota of 1,400 words added, I think I'm going to aim for a quota of 500 words removed.  That should get me down to my 90k target in 5 days.

21:56.  Oops.  I walked too far today.  I'm supposed to stop at 9 hours, but I went 40 minutes past that.  So.  12.5 miles.  2,187 kcal.  44,087 steps.  9 hours, 40 minutes, 21 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.

22:05.  92,177 words on the file.  I went through three chapters (now two) pulling off words as I could, and I managed to remove only 73 words.  Trying to remove 500 words per day may be overly ambitious.  We'll see how it goes tomorrow.

22:08.  I've just realized that, now that I have the [[Candy-Vault]], eating sweets triggers loss aversion.  If I eat the sweets, I can no longer have them in my vault!
