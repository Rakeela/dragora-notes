#Heroes-in-Hell

I have read two books in this series.  One of them, I reviewed on Goodreads.  Find that here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5452353588

The other one is "War in Hell", which is now poorly remembered though I remember enjoying it greatly.  In theory, it should go back on my to-read queue so that I can enjoy it again and maybe form a stronger opinion of it, but in practice I have so much to read that I don't know if such a re-read will ever reach the top of the list.
