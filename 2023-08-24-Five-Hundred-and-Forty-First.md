12:24.  I thought, "I can do that, and I can even do the other thing, but I've got to get today's logging started."  What I was thinking about is irrelevant, and I've actually forgotten half of it, but today's logging is an important step in getting moving on the day.  I got up hours ago and I haven't done anything productive.  I probably won't for a while yet.  It's terrible how unproductive I am today, but I have a headache, and I just took headache medicine for it.  I think once my headache fades I'll be able to make a good start.  I have some rewriting to do on Kura and Kaire.

18:51.  Wow.  I have been braindead today.  I haven't gotten anything productive done.  The closest thing I've done to real productivity is to read an 11th of an LGBT history book.

20:02.  Maybe I can at least edit a chapter today.  90,490...  Wait, I had the rewrite to do.

22:32.  91,396.  906 words of progress.

22:35.  91,406.  916 words of progress.  Done for tonight.  Kind of pathetic progress.  I needed to start earlier, very emphatically.

22:38.  7.8 miles.  1,421 kcal.  28,775 steps.  6 hours, 34 minutes, 7 seconds.  Average speed 1.1 mph.
