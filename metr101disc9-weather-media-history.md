# Metr101disc9 Weather Media History

(Quoted from Instructions)
1. Choose one of the following discussion questions: 
Discussion Prompt #1: Think about some of your favorite weather scenes in movies (or TV shows). You can also think about how weather appears in music or art. 

Weather has played a supporting role (sometimes lead role) in movies from the old classics "Singing in the Rain" and "Wizard of Oz" to other movies like "Twister", "Day After Tomorrow", and "Everest". 

Use your newly acquired knowledge of meteorology and give us an analysis of how realistic and scientifically accurate you think some of these movies are related to various weather phenomena. Be a critic! 

Your response should be around 7-10 sentences. 
 

Discussion Prompt #2:  Find an example of how weather may have influenced a historical event. This is different than when weather was the event itself (like Hurricane Katrina or western Washington's wind or snowstorms, etc.), but rather some other important event in human history whose outcome was affected by the weather.

This may require a LITTLE research, but it's not my intention to make this a major research project! Just see what you can find fairly easily. There are many great events in human history that were affected by weather (i.e., London Fog, Radar and World War II). Your response should be around 7-10 sentences.
