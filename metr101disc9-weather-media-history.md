# Metr101disc9 Weather Media History

(Quoted from Instructions)
Choose one of the following discussion questions: 
Discussion Prompt #1: Think about some of your favorite weather scenes in movies (or TV shows). You can also think about how weather appears in music or art. 

Weather has played a supporting role (sometimes lead role) in movies from the old classics "Singing in the Rain" and "Wizard of Oz" to other movies like "Twister", "Day After Tomorrow", and "Everest". 

Use your newly acquired knowledge of meteorology and give us an analysis of how realistic and scientifically accurate you think some of these movies are related to various weather phenomena. Be a critic! 

Your response should be around 7-10 sentences. 
 

Discussion Prompt #2:  Find an example of how weather may have influenced a historical event. This is different than when weather was the event itself (like Hurricane Katrina or western Washington's wind or snowstorms, etc.), but rather some other important event in human history whose outcome was affected by the weather.

This may require a LITTLE research, but it's not my intention to make this a major research project! Just see what you can find fairly easily. There are many great events in human history that were affected by weather (i.e., London Fog, Radar and World War II). Your response should be around 7-10 sentences.

Whether things are major research projects for me is a question of whimsy, not the instructions or the teacher's intent.

On the other hand, I'm not thrilled by this assignment.  Cultural analysis is something I've done resentfully for reasons that should not have occurred, whereas a historical analysis like that is the sort of thing my father would have enjoyed a lot more than I would.  I don't think I'm going to do the cultural analysis here.  I'd end up writing about Civ VI's Gathering Storm DLC, I think, and the prospect is reluctant.  I'm not conventionally engaged with culture, and have hardly ever enjoyed movies.

That leaves the historical analysis.  Civ VI is a good 'lazy' source here, too; the game mixes fiction and reality (the Bermuda Triangle is in the game, though I've never seen it spawn on a map), but it's not that hard to verify which bits of the history it presents are real vs which ones are just entertainment.  Feels a little too lazy, honestly; even if I only played three turns, loading up Civ and calling it college study even briefly feels absurd.  I suppose I could also load up Ring Fit simultaneously and at least be exercising while I'm reading the Civilopedia...  It's a real option, on that note.

...hm...  I know a few things about South American history that most people don't.  I wonder if I could try to do something exotic like claiming that an unusual weather fluctuation contributed to the pandemic that wiped out millions of people who used to live in what is today the Amazon Rainforest.  That'd be obscure!  Perhaps if I can find documents correlating epidemiological fluctuations with El Niño and La Niña I can make that argument.

Sandweiss, DH.  Maasch, KA.  Burger, RL.  Richardson, JB3.  Rollins, HB.  Clement, A.  (2001, Jul 1.)  Variation in Holocene El Niño frequencies: Climate records and cultural consequences in ancient Peru.  *Geology*.  Retrieved 2021-3-3 from https://www.academia.edu/download/35248778/Sandweiss_et_al.2001.Variation_in_Holocene_El_Nino_frequencies.pdf

This looks fun.  It talks about how a climate shift may have changed religious patterning.  El Niño causes fish die-offs.  Were the temples built to ward off this bad omen, and abandoned many centuries later when the fish die-offs became more frequent?  If I can find the full text on this, I may use it as the basis of a discussion post.

...got it!  Retrieval link added to source.

I am not succeeding at getting my brain wired to this material.  Hedonic hierarchy conflict.  I don't like thinking about ancient people as people who actually existed.  My brain angles off the existential horror and fixates on strategy games instead.  This preserves positive emotional experience, but presently at the expense of my efforts to visualize shifts in available resources caused by climate fluctuations.  Why might El Niño have caused a shift in power favoring the construction of massive temples?  There's usually some logic to human affairs, faulty though it be.

Was it flooding?  Did other structures wash away?  Yet that feels absurd; massive floods do not happen every day.  Was it a need for raised storage?

Park, W.  (2016, Aug 11.)  "A lost temple could teach us about how modern society is structured."  *BBC Future*.  Retrieved 3-3-3 from https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160808-a-lost-temple-holds-the-secrets-to-the-origins-of-authority.

This is a Peruvian temple thought to have been first occupied five thousand years ago.  It is from about two hundred years before the period of monumental temple dominance ended.

(Quoted from Source)
“Chavin was built in a risky spot, in a highly flood-prone location,” explains John Rick, associate professor of anthropology, Stanford. “They were aware of the risk of floods and they built towards these risks and not away from them. The monumentality was not only to impress visitors but also to tell them that the creators were capable of challenging nature successfully. And they did very well with it.”

People looked to the priests to help them challenge nature.  The most long-lived of the monumental temple communities were the ones that did the most earthmoving to stabilize the landscape of the community so that weather fluctuations wouldn't ruin lives.

(Quoted from Source)
There’s evidence that visitors from far away came here – objects brought here from at least 500km (310 miles), “which at the time would be an extraordinary distance to travel,” says Rick. “This leads us to think the people that came here were important figures. This was a cult for the secondary elite who were now emerging and for whom Chavin fit very well in their world view.”

(Quotation Continues)
Visitors would be asked for contributions of labour to show their commitment to the cult. Local leaders would bring expert workers with them who could help to construct these intricate temples. There’s evidence of exquisite pottery and stone work from far away. In return, only the leaders would be permitted to enter the temple. The more important you were, or the more you could offer the cult, the further into the temple you could pass in a kind of initiation ceremony. By doing so, they were committing themselves to the cult, and being touched by the god-like powers of the priests. “This was a conspiracy, you could almost say, of people working in league with each other and Chavin impressed them.”

They were gathering information about what was possible, and using it to create an otherworldly shared experience binding people deemed to be of a rare and special class.  They were also challenging the weather.

Hm...  So they only dominated to the extent that their initiated leaders seemed to be *able* to challenge the weather...  Modern Peru can suffer billions of dollars in damage from mudslides during El Niño, due to flooding and mudslides.  Maybe that was true then as well.  The monolithic temples were structures built where they could be built in areas of false risk; they were places which would look impressive, where the builders of the temples believed that they could build long-term structures.  Despite the obscured form of the knowledge dissemination happening at the temples, their function was still primarily the dissemination of knowledge.  Without books to distribute, I'm not quite sure how to do better than that.

Kelly, C.  (2014, Aug 19.)  "Peru: El Niño Still on Economic Radar".  *Focus-economics.com*  Retrieved 2021-3-3 from https://www.focus-economics.com/blog/posts/peru-el-nino-still-on-economic-radar

This helps substantiate Peru's special dependency on climate fluctuations.  An astute student of the global market may at this point wish to note that the odds of an El Niño cycle in the next few years are presently estimated to be increasing... but I won't cite that, as I don't need it for this discussion post.

Do I know enough about this subject to write about how Peru's ancient society may have developed around a leadership-model invoking long-term challenge against the weather?  Convincing the people to not build huts on the most obviously unstable hills would have been a life-saving public service in that era.

Maybe I should look up how hill stability can be evaluated.  If I really wanted to give this scholarly power (which I don't; it's a discussion post), I could try to correlate the temple sites with flood and mudslide risk maps.  That would be going too far for this application, but showing a means of hill stability evaluation may help.

I'm not sure what this needs to become something I'd be excited to draft; I think I may even change my mind about the topic.

It appears that the period of monumental temple dominance in ancient Peru is formally included in the span of time classified as 'Period 5' in Peruvian history.  It was a preceramic culture known as Lauricocha III.  Thousands of years of preceramic humans...  They had stone and adobe brick architecture already, but no pottery.  What does it take to invent pottery?  You have to shape clay into a form, then burn it until it stays that way.

I got this detail off of Wikipedia.  Not worth citing...  Not enough of an understanding to write about.  How do I speak confidently about something that ancient?

---
I found another source talking about the temples as potentially pertaining to ancient long-term droughts in the area.  So the Peruvian landscape was dominated by droughts interspersed with destabilizing amounts of precipitation?  I understand why humans died there, but I'm confused why humans lived there.

"I believe that weather is a conquerable force, and in our skill at dealing with it, we have come far."  -  Should I use this rhetorical angle for approaching the Peru topic?  It kind of matches my attitude as a weather controller.  I see weather as something that *can* destroy civilization and *has* destroyed civilizations, but which civilizations *can* withstand and *have* withstood.  Moreover, I see it as something that technology eventually tames and masters.  Sometimes I get frustrated at how uncontrollable the weather is perceived to be, because I feel like I have such a better sense of humus than most people...  Civ VI's new concept of Preserve districts matches a kind of productivity that makes sense to me, but not one found historically.  Historic humans seem to have consumed the landscape pretty recklessly instead.  Tch...  Ah well...  I suppose at least the grove lets me fantasize about a better world.  Rhetorically, I can tell *specifically* that I need to ditch the 'we have come far' line here, because its good resonance has a distracting association.

I'm not synched with this topic yet, but I'm closer.

"Weather has always shaped history.  Although little survives of their specific practices..."   Perhaps that right there summarizes what discontents me about this project.  I need to know more about the faith to make this beautiful.
