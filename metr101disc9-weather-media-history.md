# Metr101disc9 Weather Media History

(Quoted from Instructions)
Choose one of the following discussion questions: 
Discussion Prompt #1: Think about some of your favorite weather scenes in movies (or TV shows). You can also think about how weather appears in music or art. 

Weather has played a supporting role (sometimes lead role) in movies from the old classics "Singing in the Rain" and "Wizard of Oz" to other movies like "Twister", "Day After Tomorrow", and "Everest". 

Use your newly acquired knowledge of meteorology and give us an analysis of how realistic and scientifically accurate you think some of these movies are related to various weather phenomena. Be a critic! 

Your response should be around 7-10 sentences. 
 

Discussion Prompt #2:  Find an example of how weather may have influenced a historical event. This is different than when weather was the event itself (like Hurricane Katrina or western Washington's wind or snowstorms, etc.), but rather some other important event in human history whose outcome was affected by the weather.

This may require a LITTLE research, but it's not my intention to make this a major research project! Just see what you can find fairly easily. There are many great events in human history that were affected by weather (i.e., London Fog, Radar and World War II). Your response should be around 7-10 sentences.

Whether things are major research projects for me is a question of whimsy, not the instructions or the teacher's intent.

On the other hand, I'm not thrilled by this assignment.  Cultural analysis is something I've done resentfully for reasons that should not have occurred, whereas a historical analysis like that is the sort of thing my father would have enjoyed a lot more than I would.  I don't think I'm going to do the cultural analysis here.  I'd end up writing about Civ VI's Gathering Storm DLC, I think, and the prospect is reluctant.  I'm not conventionally engaged with culture, and have hardly ever enjoyed movies.

That leaves the historical analysis.  Civ VI is a good 'lazy' source here, too; the game mixes fiction and reality (the Bermuda Triangle is in the game, though I've never seen it spawn on a map), but it's not that hard to verify which bits of the history it presents are real vs which ones are just entertainment.  Feels a little too lazy, honestly; even if I only played three turns, loading up Civ and calling it college study even briefly feels absurd.  I suppose I could also load up Ring Fit simultaneously and at least be exercising while I'm reading the Civilopedia...  It's a real option, on that note.

...hm...  I know a few things about South American history that most people don't.  I wonder if I could try to do something exotic like claiming that an unusual weather fluctuation contributed to the pandemic that wiped out millions of people who used to live in what is today the Amazon Rainforest.  That'd be obscure!  Perhaps if I can find documents correlating epidemiological fluctuations with El Niño and La Niña I can make that argument.

This looks fun.  It talks about how a climate shift may have changed religious patterning.  El Niño causes fish die-offs.  Were the temples built to ward off this bad omen, and abandoned many centuries later when the fish die-offs became more frequent?  If I can find the full text on this, I may use it as the basis of a discussion post.
