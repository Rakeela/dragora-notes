# Session 3 Notes

I'm still trying to show up to these classes.  They're difficult for me.  I suspect that if I could find the right things to write during the lecture, I could keep my attention on the content throughout.  If that balance works, perhaps it will function as a useful meditation upon the skills currently to be instructed.

Initial indicators are positive.

Following is transcribed (from the lecture slide) the current class announcements.  {} indicates my annotations.

Announcements:
1. Homework 1 is extended to 1/13.  {I've already completed this.}
2. When you open your sapling learning homework (even before you answer your first question) it will say your grade is 0% and as and when you progress it will change.
3. It takes at least 10 minutes for the canvas and sapling learning gradebooks to do deep integration. So, wait for 15 minutes to cross check your final score in canvas.
4. Watch the YouTube video for each chapter (link given in canvas)
5. Watch the recorded video of the class lecture under panopto recording (canvas top left hand side)
6. Go through the exercise and chapter summary.

The teacher is currently explaining these.  I didn't know how long it takes the grades to update.  I'd noticed some discrepancy, but hadn't worried about it as I'd noticed also that the grades were eventually correct.  I get the impression that this teacher's overall presentation speed will not make keeping notes too challenging.

Describing Quantitative Distributions with Numbers

{Transcribed from lecture}
The quantitative can be described using numbers.

...I still can't understand everything the professor says.

It's a lecture about chapter 2 overall.

{Slide transcription}
Describing Distribution with Numbers
1. Measures of center: mean, median, and mode {covered today}
2. Measures of spread: quartiles {today} and standard deviation {thursday}
3. The five-number summary and boxplots {today}
4. IQR and outliers  {thursday}
5. Dealing with outliers {thursday}

{Slide transcription}
Measures of center: the mean
The mean, or arithmetic average
(10+2+3+9+11)/5
= 35/5
= 7 {the mean}
{"Average and mean are one and the same." - I wonder about /that/ as an artistic statement.}

{Skipping a slide of transcription.  I understand the arithmetic average.  I'm not getting value out of the professor's next slide, though as I watch her write on the slide I'm starting to appreciate her presentation of the concept as an application of algebra in process explanation.}

{Excel?  Ah, she's showing potential ways to automate this task.}

{Transcribed from professor's annotation on slide}
The Sigma greek alphabet to represent sum

{There's an E-like symbol not readily transcribed in this form of notes, presented as Sigma, and described as an alternative summation for "the result of adding all the values in a sequence".  If you take Sigma as an input in an equation, its value is equivalent to all the values in a specified sequence added together.}

{An X with a line atop it is described as an alternative summation for "the mean".  If you take X-with-aline-atop-it as an input to an equation, its value is equivalent to Sigma of a specified sequence divided by the number of items in that sequence.)

{Sum is equal to 1/n times Sigma i=1... times x to the item..?  Hm.  I think I understand this concept better without that particular tangle of notations.  I'm not equipped to transcribe them in this format, and I'm not quite familiar enough with them to deconstruct them into a competent linguistic representation.}

{Slide transcription}
The Mode
Most often occurring term
(The one with the maximum frequency)
* Sort observations from smallest to largest

{Transcribed from professor's annotation on slide}
2, 1, 1, 3, 4
Mean = {X-with-a-line-atop-it} = 11/5 = 2.2
Mode: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 {Professor drew a line under the two 1s.  It's curved as though she were drawing a smiley face using the comma between them as a nose.}

{Transcribed from professor's annotation on slide}
Find the mode:
2, 1, 2, 7, 8, 7, 5
Sort: 1, 2, 2, 5, 7, 7, 8
Mode: 2, 7 {Professor described this as 'bimodal'}

{Slide transcription}
The median
Middle term
Sort observations from smallest to largest
Example 1.
Find the median of 3, 2, 7, 5, 1
Sort: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 {Professor circled the three}
Middle term is 3. Median is 3.
Example 2: find the median of 5, 2, 7, 1
Sort: 1, 2, 5, 7
{Median = X-with-a-line-atop-it of 2, 5 = 3.5}

{Slide transcription}
Find the mean, median, and mode for the following:
3, 7, 1, 5, 9, 10, 2, 3, 14, 5, 9.
{Sort: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9, 9, 10, 14}
{Mean = } 
{Median = 5}
{Mode = 3, 5, 9}
Mean = 68/11 = 6.182 {The professor moved forward before I'd finished doing the arithmetic.}
Median = 5 {Okay, so I got this one right}
Mode = 3, 5, 9 {Got this as well.}

{Slide transcription}
Calculation of Median
Column 1: 1, 2, 3, {Etc, to 25.  Each number in column 2 has a label for its position in the column.}
Column 2: 0.6, 1.2, 1.6, 1.9, 1.5, 2.1, 2.3, 2.3, 2.5, 2.8, 2.9, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.7, 4.9, 5.3, 5.6, 6.1
{The median in Column 2 is highlighted in purple.}
Column 3: {As column 1, but truncated to 24 elements}
Column 4: {As column 2, but truncated to 24 elements}
{This was being used to demonstrate how Column #4's median must be calculated as the average of its two most central items.}

{Slide transcription}
Find the Mean and Median for the following:
1. 1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5
Mean: 4.93
Median: 3
2. 1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,11,12,15
Mean: 4.93
Median: 3
3. 1,2,3,4,5
Mean: 3 
Median: 3
4. 1,2,3,4,5000
Mean: 1002
Median: 3

{The teacher is describing a property of symmetric curves.  I think she just said that in a symmetrical distribution, the mean and median are the same.}

{She's describing something about mean and medians in a skewed curve.  Note to self: The thin side is the way the curve is "skewed to".  So a curve that is thin on the right side is skewed to the right.  The teacher describes this as a property of the mean and median.  The mean is higher than the median in a curve skewed to the right, and lower than the median in a curve skewed to the left.}

{Now she's describing five thousand as an outlier.  Example four, she has described as "a symmetric curve with an outlier".}

{There was some stuff I might've missed while working with merge conflicts on my notes, but it sounds like she's talking about the same stuff repetitively...}

Comparing the mean and the median
The median is a measure of center that is resistant to skew and outliers.  The mean is not.
{graph with identical mean and median} Mean and median for a symmetric distribution
{graph with mean less than median and long tail on left} {graph with mean greater than median and long tail on right} Mean and median for skewed distributions
