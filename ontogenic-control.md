# Ontogenic Control

Ontogenic control is control of the self-organizing potential of organic tissue.  It's about biomachinery.  [[vat-meat]] and [[organ-printing]] are specific applications of ontogenic control, but so is something humbler like [[insulin-production]], which is done using modified safe microbial lifeforms as a production asset.  I'm potentially years away from being able to perform the experiments, but I've been adding notes about [[mitochondria]] to this concept web largely because it has occurred to me to use a production method analogous to the way that insulin is produced to industrialize the production of mitochondria.  I believe such an advance could be important for [[rejuvenative-medical-interventions]].
