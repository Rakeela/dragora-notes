If there's one thing that I'll grant Earth over life as a dragon, it's that eating a diet predominantly composed of deer for centuries really upset me.  I don't (usually) like hunting, and the flesh of deer is *not* delicious.  Earth's food is better.

I wish people hadn't pretended to misunderstand my hunting stories.  My species hunted the way tigers hunt.  Leap upon the prey's back at speed, and they'll go down with back injuries.  It smashes them, yes.  That's literally true.  You bite through their neck if they don't die to that.  The idea of hunting prey by smashing them was used to mock me if I was disobedient, like pretty much everything else.  My life was controlled by the authoritarianism of rudeness, which worked on me because I'm empathetic and I recognize rudeness as a form of rebuke.

I committed the sin of having actual emotions without hiding them behind a mask of stone, for which I was deemed a sociopath; I committed the sin of believing that others were virtuous enough for me to be emotionally vulnerable to them, for which I was deemed a narcissist; I committed the sin of being obedient to sexual abusers, for which I was deemed a sexual predator.

I wish liberalism had been stronger when I was young on Earth, so that I wouldn't have been molested.  But "live and let live" is apparently boring to people who think it's exciting to punish disobedient thought and victimize those who don't obey them... and seemingly it's "not liberal" to oppose people who get bored if they're not allowed to abuse others.
