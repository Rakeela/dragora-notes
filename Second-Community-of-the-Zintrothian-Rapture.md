#Second-Community-of-the-Zintrothian-Rapture

The second Rapture Community I tried was the Second Community of the Zintrothian Rapture.  In an effort to get them to think about the events of the setting more as they had in Polis Diamonil itself, I modified their starting conditions by giving them a library of books from Polis Diamonil.  It worked.

Unfortunately, the game's berserk and horrific foreign policy model killed them all.  The pacifistic Zintrothians needed a nation built up to protect them before facing the brunt of the uncontrollably insane NPC nations.  Tch.
