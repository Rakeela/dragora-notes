(Commentary:  We've just been given study guides for Exam 1.  I think I have enough of this stuff down to pass the exam if it were given today, although that would be a particular nightmare, as the material towards the end of the guide has yet to be taught.  Going by what's on the slide today, that material is what today is /for/.)

(Commentary:  We can have a 3x5 notecard at the exam!  Good gravy, this class hands out advantages.  Yet how do I know which material I need the notecard for?)
