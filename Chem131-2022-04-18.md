(Commentary:  We've just been given study guides for Exam 1.  I think I have enough of this stuff down to pass the exam if it were given today, although that would be a particular nightmare, as the material towards the end of the guide has yet to be taught.  Going by what's on the slide today, that material is what today is /for/.)

(Commentary:  We can have a 3x5 notecard at the exam!  Good gravy, this class hands out advantages.  Yet how do I know which material I need the notecard for?)

Exam #1 will be on the 29th of April.  11 days to the first exam in Chem131!

Functional groups such as
* An alcohol contain a hydroxyl group (-OH).
* A phenol contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a benezene ring.
* A thiol contains an (-SH) group.  (Commentary:  S is sulphur. 
 I'm disappointed the -SH group doesn't have a name the way the hydroxyl group has one.  Hydrosulph group?)
(The examples are given of Methanol CH3-OH, Phenol benzene-OH, and Ethanethiol CH3-CH2-SH.)

In the IUPAC system, replace the e of alkane with ol.  With common names, use the name of the alkyl group followed by alcohol.

Table example:
CH4 = Methane
CH3OH = Methanol = Methyl Alcohol
CH3-CH2 = Ethane
CH3-CH2-OH = Ethanol = Ethyl Alcohol
(Commentary:  Yay, I copied the whole thing fast enough, thanks to Jose asking a question.)

For alcohols with three or more carbon atoms, number the carbons in the chain to give the position of the -OH group and any substituents on the chain.  (The examples are given of 1-Propanol (aka propyl alcohol) and 2-Propanol (aka isopropyl alcohol).  1-Propanol has the hydroxyl group replacing a hydrogen at the end of the chain, while 2-propanol has the hydroxyl group replacing a hydrogen on the middle carbon of the propane chain.)

An alcohol with two -OH groups is named as a diol.  An alcohol with three -OH groups is named as a triol.  (The exaples are given of 2-Butanol and 1,2-Butanediol.)

A cyclic alcohol is named as a cycloalkanol.  If there are substituents, the ring is numbered from carbon 1,which is the carbon attached to the -OH group.  (The example is given of 2-Methylcyclopentanol, which is numbered from the hydroxyl group as one.)  Compounds with no substituents do not require a number for the hydroxyl group (the example is given of cyclohexanol.)

To name a phenol with two substituents, assign carbon 1 to the carbon attached to the hydroxyl (-OH) group, and number the ring to give the lowest numbers.  Use prefixes ortho, meta, and para for common names.  (The examples are given of Phenol, 3-Chlorophenol aka m-chlorophenol, 4-Ethylphenol aka p-ethylphenol, and 3-Methylphenol aka m-cresol.)

(Commentary:  The rule which yielded m-cresol doesn't seem to have been fully explained, but the teacher says we're not expected to remember that one.)

1.  Name the longest carbon chain attached to the hydroxyl (-OH) group by replacing the e in the corresponding alkane name with ol.  Name an aromatic alcohol as a phenol.
2. Number the chain starting at the end nearer to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.
3. Give the location and name for each substituent relative to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.
(The examples are given of 5-methyl-2-hexanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, and 3-bromophenol aka m-bromophenol.)

Methanol (methyl alcohol), the simplest alcohol, is found in many solvents and paint removers.  It is oxidized to formaldehyde when ingested and can cause headaches, blindness, and death.

Ethanol (ethyl alcohl) has been known since prehistoric times as an intoxicating product.  It is formed by the fermentation of grains, sugars, and starches.  It is also used as a solvent for perfumes, varnishes, and some medicines, such as tincture of iodine.
