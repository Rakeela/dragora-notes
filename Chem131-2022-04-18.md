(Commentary:  We've just been given study guides for Exam 1.  I think I have enough of this stuff down to pass the exam if it were given today, although that would be a particular nightmare, as the material towards the end of the guide has yet to be taught.  Going by what's on the slide today, that material is what today is /for/.)

(Commentary:  We can have a 3x5 notecard at the exam!  Good gravy, this class hands out advantages.  Yet how do I know which material I need the notecard for?)

Exam #1 will be on the 29th of April.  11 days to the first exam in Chem131!

Functional groups such as
* An alcohol contain a hydroxyl group (-OH).
* A phenol contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a benezene ring.
* A thiol contains an (-SH) group.  (Commentary:  S is sulphur. 
 I'm disappointed the -SH group doesn't have a name the way the hydroxyl group has one.  Hydrosulph group?)
(The examples are given of Methanol CH3-OH, Phenol benzene-OH, and Ethanethiol CH3-CH2-SH.)

In the IUPAC system, replace the e of alkane with ol.  With common names, use the name of the alkyl group followed by alcohol.

Table example:
CH4 = Methane
CH3OH = Methanol = Methyl Alcohol
CH3-CH2 = Ethane
CH3-CH2-OH = Ethanol = Ethyl Alcohol
(Commentary:  Yay, I copied the whole thing fast enough, thanks to Jose asking a question.)

For alcohols with three or more carbon atoms, number the carbons in the chain to give the position of the -OH group and any substituents on the chain.  (The examples are given of 1-Propanol (aka propyl alcohol) and 2-Propanol (aka isopropyl alcohol).  1-Propanol has the hydroxyl group replacing a hydrogen at the end of the chain, while 2-propanol has the hydroxyl group replacing a hydrogen on the middle carbon of the propane chain.)

An alcohol with two -OH groups is named as a diol.  An alcohol with three -OH groups is named as a triol.  (The exaples are given of 2-Butanol and 1,2-Butanediol.)

A cyclic alcohol is named as a cycloalkanol.  If there are substituents, the ring is numbered from carbon 1,which is the carbon attached to the -OH group.  (The example is given of 2-Methylcyclopentanol, which is numbered from the hydroxyl group as one.)  Compounds with no substituents do not require a number for the hydroxyl group (the example is given of cyclohexanol.)

To name a phenol with two substituents, assign carbon 1 to the carbon attached to the hydroxyl (-OH) group, and number the ring to give the lowest numbers.  Use prefixes ortho, meta, and para for common names.  (The examples are given of Phenol, 3-Chlorophenol aka m-chlorophenol, 4-Ethylphenol aka p-ethylphenol, and 3-Methylphenol aka m-cresol.)

(Commentary:  The rule which yielded m-cresol doesn't seem to have been fully explained, but the teacher says we're not expected to remember that one.)

1.  Name the longest carbon chain attached to the hydroxyl (-OH) group by replacing the e in the corresponding alkane name with ol.  Name an aromatic alcohol as a phenol.
2. Number the chain starting at the end nearer to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.
3. Give the location and name for each substituent relative to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.
(The examples are given of 5-methyl-2-hexanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, and 3-bromophenol aka m-bromophenol.)

Methanol (methyl alcohol), the simplest alcohol, is found in many solvents and paint removers.  It is oxidized to formaldehyde when ingested and can cause headaches, blindness, and death.

Ethanol (ethyl alcohl) has been known since prehistoric times as an intoxicating product.  It is formed by the fermentation of grains, sugars, and starches.  It is also used as a solvent for perfumes, varnishes, and some medicines, such as tincture of iodine.
(Fermentation reaction given below:)
C6H12O6 -> 2 CH3-CH2-OH + 2 CO2

1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol) is used as an antifreeze in heating and cooling systems.  It is also a solvent for paints, inks, and plastics.  It's used in the production of synthetic fibers such as Dacron.  If ingested, it is extremely toxic.  In the body, it is oxidized to oxalic acid, which forms insoluble salts in the kidneys that cause renal damage, convulsions, and death.

(Commentary: The teacher made the point that even ethanol is toxic.  Alcohols appear to be bad for health, chemically.)

Bisphenol A (BPA) is used to make polycarbonate, a clear plastic that is used to manufacture beverage bottles, including baby bottles.  Washing polycarbonate bottles with certain detergents or at high temperatures disrupts the polymer, causing small amounts of BPA to leach from the bottles.

Phenols found in essential oils of plants produce the odor or flavor of the plant.  Nutmeg is flavored by isoengenol.  Thyme is flavored by thymol.  Cloves is flavored by eugenol.  Vanilla is flavored by vanillin.

Thiols, also known as mercaptans, are a family of sulphur-containing organic compounds that have a thiol group (-SH).

In the IUPAC system, thiols are named by adding -thiol to the alkane name of the longest carbon chain and numbering the carbon chain from the end nearer the thiol (-SH) group.

(Commentary:  There IS a name for the sulphur group!  It's the thiol group.  That feels obvious in hindsight.)

Thiols contain a thiol (-SH) group.  They often have strong and sometimes disagreeable odors.  They are found in cheese, onions, garlic, and oysters.  They're used to detect gas leaks.  (The example is given of trans-2-Butene-1-thiol, aka skunk spray.)

Methanethiol is the compound that has an odor characteristic of oysters, cheddar cheese, onions, and garlic.  Garlic also contains 2-propene-1-thiol.  Onions also contain 1-propanethiol.

Most anesthetics are ethers.  (The example is given of forane aka isoflurane, an inhaled anesthetic.)

An ether contains an -O- between two carbon groups that are alkyls or aromatic rings.  (Commentary:  Jose commented, "Either side" on this, as one of his mnemonics.)  Ethers have a common name that gives the alkyl names of the attached groups in alphatetical order followed by ether.  (The examples are given of dimethyl ether, ethyl methyl ether, and methyl phenyl ether.)

Most ethers have common names.

In the IUPAC system, an ether is named with an alkoxy group made up of the smaller alkyl group and the oxygen atom, followed by the alkane name of the longer carbon chain.  (The example is given of 1-methoxypropane, aka methyl propyl ether.)

1. Write the alkane name of the longer carbon chain.
2. Name the oxygen and smaller alkyl group as an alkoxy group.
3. Number the longer carbon chain from the end nearer the alkoxy group and give its location.
(The example is given of 1-ethoxybutane, aka ethyl butyl ether.)

A cyclic ether contains an O atom in a carbon ring.  It is called a heterocyclic compound.  It typically has 5 atoms (furan) or 6 atoms (pyran) in the ring.  (The examples are given of Furan, Tetrahydrofuran, Pyran, and 1,4-Dioxane.)  (Commentary:  Furan and pyran?  What atypical names those sound like.  I wonder how they were devised.  The teacher says we won't need to remember the examples of cyclic ethers.)

(Commentary:  I tend to remember propane's carbon count by remembering cyclopropane is a triangle, whereas I remember butane's by remembering that it is the largest of the special case names, and the only one that is a liquid at room temperature.)

(Commentary:  Despite telling us we wouldn't need to remember the cyclic ether examples, the current slide has just study-checked us on 1,4-Dioxane.)

Anesthesia is the loss of sensation and consciousness.  A general anesthetic is a substance that blocks signals to the awareness centers in the brain while giving the patient a loss of memory, a loss of feeling pain, and an artificial sleep.

Diethyl ether, CH3-CH2-O-CH2-CH3, commonly called ether, was used for over a century, but it caused nausea and is dangerous to use due to its flammability.

Ether was used in anesthetic for a hundred years until the 1950s, when new anesthetics were developed that retain the ether group while replacing hydrogen atoms on the carbon with halogen atoms to reduce the volatility and flammability of the ethers.  (Examples given are forane aka isoflurane, ethrane aka enflurane, suprane aka desflurane, and sevoflurane.)
