(Commentary:  We've just been given study guides for Exam 1.  I think I have enough of this stuff down to pass the exam if it were given today, although that would be a particular nightmare, as the material towards the end of the guide has yet to be taught.  Going by what's on the slide today, that material is what today is /for/.)

(Commentary:  We can have a 3x5 notecard at the exam!  Good gravy, this class hands out advantages.  Yet how do I know which material I need the notecard for?)

Exam #1 will be on the 29th of April.  11 days to the first exam in Chem131!

Functional groups such as
* An alcohol contain a hydroxyl group (-OH).
* A phenol contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a benezene ring.
* A thiol contains an (-SH) group.  (Commentary:  S is sulphur. 
 I'm disappointed the -SH group doesn't have a name the way the hydroxyl group has one.  Hydrosulph group?)
(The examples are given of Methanol CH3-OH, Phenol benzene-OH, and Ethanethiol CH3-CH2-SH.)
