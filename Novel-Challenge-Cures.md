#Novel-Challenge-Cures

I may want to start adding cure-tech proposals to each of these.  For instance, my intent with Anti-Statisticians is that it would be cured with Distributed Thought, representing that the public cure the AI chaos problem by learning to re-interpret the investment market from first principles rather than remaining bound to mistaken prior understandings.  This practice of falling back gently upon the underutilized minds so that their understanding helps society develop is very much the kind of thing that I imagine the Old Imperials taking pleasure in.

Come to think of the Old Imperials 'taking pleasure' in fixing a challenge, is each challenge something detested by the faction which can fix it?  Is this part of the implied competing ideological structures in this game's setting?

I can imagine for instance that if a Panarchic AI Collective took over a region with antistatisticians infesting its market, they might instead enjoy building up the infrastructure to retake the market for more civilized and cooperative AI bankers.  They would contest the antistatisticians as fellow AI citizens and integrate them into their computerized markets.  This approach is slightly more expensive overall, but it's also friendlier.

Sufficiently advanced AIs are actual people.  If the Old Imperials construct a 'hyperspace market' out of the distributed understanding potential of the populous as a whole to coordinate behavior such that over-competitive market AIs get frozen out of it, they're making actual people suffer isolation and sudden incompetence in a form of economic endeavor they would otherwise be able to retain a place in indefinitely.

Panarchic Wargames should probably be cured by the Panarchic Naval Port.  Once you have that development, you have the societal infrastructure to integrate the disruptive potential of the wargames in a regular manner.  So even though it's a very Panarchy problem, it also has a very Panarchy solution.  I think this represents a fair externality of the Panarchy.  Their overbuilt recreational military is partially everywhere.  It's mostly harmless, but it's too real to be free in its passage.

Psuedostatisticians is a challenge that I would expect to see cured by the Panarchic Survey technology.  Not only are panarchic survey constructions an investment in supporting statisticians, their attitude (no practice sacred) may be able to 'reach' counter-productive anti-bureaucratists.

This suggests that the Panarchy harbors antistatisticians (AI bankers whose selfishly optimized economic behavior destroys the comprehensibility of market data), while the Empire harbors psuedostatisticians (serene liars who like to see what happens when bad data gets passed off as valid).  I think that's appropriate.

Once I have enough thoughts on cure techs built up, I'll know what kind of cure tech thoughts pages I should build.  Hm...  I wonder if I can write a book on [[The-Viceroy]].  Is that fair play in culture?  I think it's a very impressive work and I'd be glad to extend its reach a bit more if I could.
