#Novel-Challenge-Cures

I'm likely to do this wrong.  It's dreadful fan work and I'll surely make errors, such as balancing the cures improperly around the ideologies.  I'm far from assembling a complete idea of what the ideologies in the game actually are.

Cures for Novel Challenges
1.  Panarchic Wargames
	1.  Proposed cure technology:  Panarchic Navy
		1.  Justification:  The Panarchy can regularize and reorganize its forces if its authority is acknowledged, resolving the disruptions that they cause.
		2.  Apologia in Defiance:  Leaving the issue in place doesn't drive away the panarchy's navy, but it also refrains from acknowledging their right to be present.  Operations like this are neither infinitely resilient nor indefinitely sustainable.  Given sufficient time, they will leave or be forced to depart, and we will not have given ground while they were here.  (Anti-Panarchistic.)
		3.  Apologia in Neglect:  Bureaucratically speaking, ignoring the panarchy's military is cheap, but operating their ports is expensive.  We pay upkeep either way.  Why stress about it?  (Nonfactional.)
	2.  Melange FIle
		1.  Proposed cure technology:  Nationalist Indoctrination
			1.  Justification:  To get people to stop using melange files, the impairment that their shifting personalities impose to broader society has to be driven home to them.  When the public is widely convinced that they need to find ways to conform their personality types to the needs of their nation, the only people who'll keep using melange files will be the dregs of society.
			2.  Apologia in Defiance:  Melange files accelerate retraining, increase psychological resilience, and do no harm to public health.  Galactic society claims it doesn't know how to integrate immortal users of melange files, but this just shows the stagnating narrowness which we've accepted as the peak of all possible wealth.  People who want to see change in society should be supported and enabled, not oppressed.  (Panarchic.)
			3.  Apologia in Neglect:  It's what people want to do.  You want us to go out there and stop them?  Why bother?  (Nonfactional.)
	3.  Ascetic Leadership
		1.  Proposed cure technology:  Panarchic Palaces
			1.  Justification:  We do actually need leaders to be visible people in order to operate the systems that they're responsible for.
			2.  Apologia in Defiance:  The achievement of humble leadership should be worked around, but NEVER broken!  The fundamental source of a society's influence ought to be the whole of its wealth and prosperity!  (Imperial)
			3.  Apologia in Neglect:  ...isn't this ideal?  These are the leaders who don't WANT palaces.  (Nonfactional.)
		2.  Proposed cure technology:  Leisure Subsidies
			1.  Justification:  Voluntary stoicism is all well and good, but the purpose of governance is the protection of the common weal.  Protecting the happiness of the public is the most important function of government, and a leadership of contemplative invisibles is not actually an investment in doing so.
			2.  Apologia in Defiance:  If government is to put the people first, it should not be going expensively out of its way to put wasteful people into power!  (Imperial)
			3.  Apologia in Neglect:  You're asking us to pay very elevated wages for a mix of imported talent and the most profligate locals, and you're telling us that leads to a superior government.  Are you sure that you're doing the right thing?  (Nonfactional.)
		3.  (Note on multiple proposed cures:  I thought of the arguments for 'Panarchic Palaces' first, but I actually favor Leisure Subsidies here as the tech which would best "cure" ascetic leadership.  I think putting the ascetic leaders into palaces would actually be a good way to work around this 'problem' rather than a way to cure it.  Austere grandeur is not only a 'thing' in palace design, it is THE thing by which palatial architecture risks developing 'blandeur', and so there's nothing incoherent about the idea of ascetic palace-dwellers, since they are the population that can be most convincingly magnified by the appearance of austere grandeur.)
	4.  Law of Love
		1.  Proposed cure technology:  Reproductive Mandate
			1.  Justification:  If your government is willing to behave unethically to get people to reproduce more, the law of love can be broken...
			2.  Apologia in Defiance:  (Incoherent screaming opposition from otherwise polite people.)  (Nonfactional.)
			3.  Apologia in Neglect:  Whoa.  Don't touch that.  (Nonfactional.)

I'm not sure what the Mind-Merge Aftermath issue should be cured by, but I was thinking about it.  It's based on the idea that very mature cyberocracies may see 'meta-identity proofs', extensive consciousness sharing, willing archetypal optimization, and other memetic hazards which result in great swathes of society being comfortably willing to accept that they are indeed identical to each other... and that for each defined interchangeable populace, there are 'collective' advantages to losing the dupes and concentrating the identicals into a smaller number of conscious beings.  Post-concentration individuals are mind-merge revenants.

The concept here is that galactic society considers such beings extremely probably stable, but still conceptually disturbing, and it only reluctantly admits them among the immortals of the galaxy.  So for the cure, I was thinking that this should be cured by whichever faction would be most *enthused* to meet mind-merge revenants.  To that, I'm not sure; the identity collapse story is ideologically resonant with the Old Empire, but I feel like the Commonwealth Unifiers might love them even more.  The Old Empire knows it /does/ collapse despite its unity, but it doesn't /want/ to collapse in unity.  The Commonwealth Unifiers strike me as singularitans, who would love to go looking for some excuse to count mind-merge revenants among their numbers.

Each mind-merge revenant constitutes a huge singular aggregation of talent and experience, after all.

Since it represents the largest investment in densifying the society of the Commonwealth Unifiers and is on one of the tips of their tech tree, I think 'Three Shift Society' strikes me as representing a sufficient local concentration of the faction's ideas to create an area that accepts and makes influential the contributions of mind-merge revenants.  Alternatively, attributing the cure tech to 'Right to Competence' may be appropriate for helping to indicate the kind of talent sources that the Commonwealth Unifiers are glad to tap for their struggle to get competent leaders in place all across the Commonwealth.  Lacking the galactic bias against the mind-merge revenants, the Unifiers would see them as people who withstood the sorrows of a world collapsing into them, and gained that much perspective on life.

I may want to start adding cure-tech proposals to each of these.  For instance, my intent with Anti-Statisticians is that it would be cured with Distributed Thought, representing that the public cure the AI chaos problem by learning to re-interpret the investment market from first principles rather than remaining bound to mistaken prior understandings.  This practice of falling back gently upon the underutilized minds so that their understanding helps society develop is very much the kind of thing that I imagine the Old Imperials taking pleasure in.

Come to think of the Old Imperials 'taking pleasure' in fixing a challenge, is each challenge something detested by the faction which can fix it?  Is this part of the implied competing ideological structures in this game's setting?

I can imagine for instance that if a Panarchic AI Collective took over a region with antistatisticians infesting its market, they might instead enjoy building up the infrastructure to retake the market for more civilized and cooperative AI bankers.  They would contest the antistatisticians as fellow AI citizens and integrate them into their computerized markets.  This approach is slightly more expensive overall, but it's also friendlier.

Sufficiently advanced AIs are actual people.  If the Old Imperials construct a 'hyperspace market' out of the distributed understanding potential of the populous as a whole to coordinate behavior such that over-competitive market AIs get frozen out of it, they're making actual people suffer isolation and sudden incompetence in a form of economic endeavor they would otherwise be able to retain a place in indefinitely.

Panarchic Wargames should probably be cured by the Panarchic Naval Port.  Once you have that development, you have the societal infrastructure to integrate the disruptive potential of the wargames in a regular manner.  So even though it's a very Panarchy problem, it also has a very Panarchy solution.  I think this represents a fair externality of the Panarchy.  Their overbuilt recreational military is partially everywhere.  It's mostly harmless, but it's too real to be free in its passage.

Psuedostatisticians is a challenge that I would expect to see cured by the Panarchic Survey technology.  Not only are panarchic survey constructions an investment in supporting statisticians, their attitude (no practice sacred) may be able to 'reach' counter-productive anti-bureaucratists.

This suggests that the Panarchy harbors antistatisticians (AI bankers whose selfishly optimized economic behavior destroys the comprehensibility of market data), while the Empire harbors psuedostatisticians (serene liars who like to see what happens when bad data gets passed off as valid).  I think that's appropriate.

Once I have enough thoughts on cure techs built up, I'll know what kind of cure tech thoughts pages I should build.  Hm...  I wonder if I can write a book on [[The-Viceroy]].  Is that fair play in culture?  I think it's a very impressive work and I'd be glad to extend its reach a bit more if I could.
