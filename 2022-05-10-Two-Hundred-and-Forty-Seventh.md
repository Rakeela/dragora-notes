I've thought of a topic that seems important, but that I don't know where to file in my notes.  "Mental endurance" is the thing.  I've realized that my mental endurance is bad.  My physical endurance is okay, but not awesome.  I can't endure high output for very long, though I can do the endurance trick of sustaining low output for a long time.  Yet I can't do that mentally, where I tend to burn out fairly easily.

What determines mental endurance?  Can mental endurance be improved?  Should I be putting a new entry down in [[imagine-a-brain-implant]] to note my longing for a mental endurance implant?  What would a mental endurance implant actually change about the functioning of the brain?
