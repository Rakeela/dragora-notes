I've thought of a topic that seems important, but that I don't know where to file in my notes.  "Mental endurance" is the thing.  I've realized that my mental endurance is bad.  My physical endurance is okay, but not awesome.  I can't endure high output for very long, though I can do the endurance trick of sustaining low output for a long time.  Yet I can't do that mentally, where I tend to burn out fairly easily.

What determines mental endurance?  Can mental endurance be improved?  Should I be putting a new entry down in [[imagine-a-brain-implant]] to note my longing for a mental endurance implant?  What would a mental endurance implant actually change about the functioning of the brain?

I think I'm going to create a [[Movies-Watched]] section in my notes.  Someone I met through World Anvil commissions has gotten me watching a whole bunch of Godzilla movies, successfully replacing my previous favorites with the original Godzilla movie.  Since then, I've felt like I'm not remembering all the movies very well, and it bothers me.  If I add a section akin to my [[Bibliography]] for movies, I'll remember the movies for longer, and therefore treasure them more.

I feel kind of sorry for people who do stuff they can't be honest and open about.  The stuff people want to see forgotten is sometimes, y'know, actually forgotten.  Hiding stuff can succeed!  But then they can't think about it too much, either.  It becomes a splinter of amnesia or neurosis.

I don't want the movies that I've watched to become splinters of amnesia.  Just as I've probably still forgotten the majority of books that I've ever read, and as I've certainly forgotten the majority of songs that I've ever heard, I've probably forgotten the majority of movies that I've watched.  The only way to fix that is to start listing them and keep the lists safe in the future.

I think the 58 movies in the [[Movies-Watched]] list actually ARE the majority of the movies that I've watched.  I'm not a big fan of movies historically.  Raising it to 62 as I've just done may help, though I'm certain there are still movies unlisted.
