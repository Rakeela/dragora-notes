I said this somewhere else during an online discussion of political economy, and I want to preserve it here as well:

"Not that I think anarcho-variants would actually work, but as a thought experiment, I would propose that a highly productive anarcho-socialist society would be difficult to distinguish from a highly compassionate anarcho-capitalist society, as the highly compassionate anarcho-capitalist society would cull the abuses of capitalism and maximize its service ethos, whereas the highly productive anarcho-socialist society would place a high premium on organizing people for economic activities."

"All economic systems without exception try to cultivate people profitably, but egalitarian ones try to cultivate people in a way that empowers the cultivated, whereas authoritarian ones try to cultivate people in a way that empowers the cultivator."
