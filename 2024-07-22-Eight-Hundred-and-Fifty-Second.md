14:51.  Wow, what have I been doing today?  I talked bats with a friend for a while.  Fictional uplifted smart bats who are talented at math.

14:54.  I slept in until like 10:30 today.  I was so tired.  My dreams wouldn't let go of my brain.  I kept slipping in and out of the same dream.  It wasn't exactly awe-inspiring, but it was okay.  It was just so sticky.  I couldn't think like I was ready to wake up.  92,399.

15:16.  Credit 107 words edited.  92,409.

15:30.  I am distracted by the desire for food, and wow am I making slow progress.  I am barely moving on my task here.  I am distracted in general.

23:12.  Wow, I have been completely useless today.  Brain no worky.  I...  I had fun today!  I was happy!  But I didn't get stuff done.  I was distracted and lost in unproductive thoughts all day long.  I woke up with dreams clinging to me, and then I was dumb all day long.  I didn't have nightmares, but it's like the conditions of my sleep affected my brain negatively all the same.
