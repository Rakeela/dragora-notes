Morning weigh-in:  249.3 pounds.

Calories-in/calories-out is such hot garbage.  I've been eating less than 1000 calories of food while exercising off 1,500 calories per day.  Despite that, my weight loss stalled.  The problem is I've eaten too many carbohydrates this week.  It's not the calorie count.  It's the sugar density.

I had a giant cookie for breakfast, followed it up with a moon pie, and now I'm eating a falafel sandwich.  I'm practically binging.  This is everything I get to eat today, condensed into one insulin spike.  The moon pie was off-plan.  It expressed my misery at living out the failure of CICO as a dietary management plan.

I'm not exercising today.  My feet hurt.  I'm taking a day off.

I ate a few chips and a protein bar.  Then a few more chips.  Sigh.  I was supposed to eat no more.  The protein bar was because I'm sore, but the chips have no excuse.

Bludger it.  My will is broken today.  I'm eating a bit of my stashed stawberry cheesecake chocolate.  Eating a bunch is what I want out of life.

At Kistaro's urging, I'm just declaring today a day off from my diet.  In exchange, tomorrow will no longer be a day off.  I've had another cookie.  But.  I'm starting to get a bit of a sugar high.  My metabolism is malfunctioning, but it's not totally broken.  The downside of taking a day off from exercise is that I have nowhere to use my restless energy.  I guess I'll go across town and see if I want anything from the Whole Foods.

I bought a few items off the salad bar and two cookies.  It took entirely too long to get across town on my scooter.  I guess that's *some* exercise, but today's such a totally wasted day.  I haven't even been writing.  All I've been doing is thinking.

I binged on boston cream handpies.  Oh dear.  Today's such a lot of caloric damage.  I have to not do this.  Or, I mean...  I have to go back to my old pattern for real.  I used to eat only up to four hundred calories per day, and then free-eat on Saturday and Sunday.  I lost seventy pounds doing that.  This week I ate like 600-800 calories per day and it went worse than that.

I've lost weight doing keto, and I've lost weight doing 400 calories, but 800 calories plus exercise only kept my weight stable.  Good grief.  I really have to stick to the 400 target.  And no more boston cream handpies!  I'll eat the rest of the pack next weekend, and then order no more.  They're individually 410 calories and dietarily inexcusable as they're a carb-bomb.

I think I can keep counting a few things as "free" in my diet.  Eggs and cheese are my freebies.  If I could survive on nothing but eggs and cheese...  That'd be keto dieting again.  Hm.  I haven't tried cheesy omelettes yet, and maybe next week I should try cooking omelettes twice a day.  If I eat enough eggs, that'll promote weight gain as well, but I don't think I like eggs enough to overeat them.  The fat calories in cheese seem to be *really* harmless, dietarily.  Sufficient protein causes an insulin response, sufficient fat does not.

As I told Kistaro and as Kistaro has been reminding me, control of insulin seems to be key to weight loss.  As long as my diet leaves my insulin in fasting levels, my weight goes down.

Sigh.  Even my vegetable preferences are carby.  I love beans and legumes.  I want to eat carbs!

Evening weigh-in:  253.5 pounds.

Notes:  I was wearing pajama pants and no socks this time, *reducing* my weight relative to jeans and socks.  It looks like the damage is even higher this time.  This will end up being a week in which my weight actually went UP.  Oh well.  Next week I'll keep my insulin levels down more completely.
