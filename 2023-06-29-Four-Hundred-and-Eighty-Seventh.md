06:56.  I got up, ate breakfast, and then logged a time point.  That's this.

06:59.  My breakfast was of sufficient size, yet it's hard to stop eating... or at least, hard to stop being hungry.  I did stop eating, so far.

08:02.  It's hard not to eat.  I have rebuked myself repeatedly for reaching for food.  I wish I lived in a virtual paradise with narcoalgorithmic food.

08:18.  I can distract myself from hunger by working on Taltios' Travelogue.  35,170 words on the file.

08:54.  I'm recalculating distances on Theoma.  According to my calculations, The Tachanigh-Kelkaith implies that Earth is 4.5 times the size of Theoma.

09:06.  So.  Hard.  To not.  Eat.  Argh.  I'm going to go buy something healthy to eat.

09:47.  Okay.  So I ate a lentil wrap.  Humble, healthy, and tasty.  Now it's hard not to eat still more.  I keep trying to shift my hungers into the consumption of caffeinated beverages, and the result is that I'm overcaffeinated *and* hungry.  Oh, and I'm still working on Taltios' Travelogue.  35,346.  Not that I'm making huge progress.

10:59.  36,478.  1,308 words on the file.

11:23.  Played a bit of Cultist Simulator.  On into the part of the game where expeditions start being a thing...  I have a history of always looking these up so that I can be assured of preparing correctly for them.  Narratively, I do not take the expeditions seriously.  I imagine that they are the cultists humoring their crazy leader by going haring off on vacations on the cult's money, and not returning until they are injured or in possession of suitable trophies.

11:45.  36,600.  That's quota, but I shouldn't stop here.

11:48.  In the face of constant hunger, my willpower has broken down.  I ate a container of cookie dough bites and a raspberry truffle bar.  Now, guess what?  I'm still hungry.  I seem to be hungry no matter what.

15:19.  199 words written for Kura and Kaire.

15:33.  Make that 198 words.  Not additional, instead.

15:56.  2,737 words edited on Kura and Kaire.

18:06.  I've realized that I feel grateful and reassured when I eat ramen.  I want to try eating more ramen.  If I replace more of my diet with ramen, can I be satisfied while eating less?  It won't cost much to try.

20:21.  I've been suffering unusual face pains.

20:46.  38,832.  2,232 words on the chapter.

20:53.  38,950.  3,780 words of progress.

20:59.  38,951.  3,781 words of progress.  I'm stuck.

21:00.  38,957.  3,787 words of progress.  I'm tweaking what I have, but I don't know what to write next.

21:02.  38,963.  3,793 words of progress.

21:37.  I just watched Kistaro play Tetris for a little bit.  When I came out of the Tetris trance, during the whole of which I stood tensely, I reviewed my time tracking.  Have I worked thirteen hours today?
