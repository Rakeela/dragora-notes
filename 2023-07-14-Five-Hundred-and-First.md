09:33.  Derby Days is here, and that means... cotton candy and food trucks.

17:10.  I ate a whole deep dish pizza today!  Eight inches.  I also ate a cookie with ice cream, and cotton candy, and a basket of "mini donuts".  That's enough food I think.  The pizza and the cookie were from my favorite pizzeria rather than from the food trucks, since I walked about and thought, "You know, I'd rather get pizza if I'm going to spend too much and eat too much."

19:29.  68,546.  Wait, whoops.  I forgot to take my starting point.  67,906.  640 words of progress.  Today may not be a day for the quota.  Also, note to self: gryphons can grit their tomia.

19:40.  68,607.  701 words of progress.  Pausing again.  Time to go hit up the food trucks again, this time with Kistaro.
