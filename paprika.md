# paprika

Paprika has almost no flavor to me.  I struggle to characterize it as something other than a pigmented dust, and it serves as one of those little reminders that other people perceive the world differently than I do.

Since paprika has no flavor to me, it can't turn me away by its independent qualia, nor can it lure me in.  If I knew and liked someone who loved paprika an awful lot, it would be pretty easy for me to develop an associational fondness of paprika.  If I knew and disliked someone who loved paprika that much, it would be pretty easy for me to develop an associational dislike of paprika.  The fact that paprika has no flavor and no associations for me is a testament to the fact that I've never met someone who expressed strong opinions about it.
