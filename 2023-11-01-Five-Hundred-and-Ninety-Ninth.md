9:10.  It's November, and that means Nanowrimo!  Also, I just ate a big ol' bowl of muesli.  Like a giant bowl of muesli.  Way too much muesli.  I'm sooooo addicted to carbs.  Switching away from sweets is part of my long-term plan to step down my carb consumption by building an aversion to sweet flavors.

10:09.  4,043 words on the book.

11:21.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  Ugh.  The muesli is still holding out.  I'm not "hungry" yet, but I'm suffering strong temptations to eat.

11:51.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  But it's been half an hour, and here I was thinking, "Ugh, I just wrote a drive to eat JUST NOW," when actually I managed to get through another half hour without eating anything.  I super-want-food now though, and I think I'm still not "hungry".

12:24.  Maybe I can eat now?  Is it okay to eat three hours after eating before?  I'm starting to feel uncertain whether or not I'm actually hungry.

15:01.  Writing productivity is slow.  5,150 words on the book.

15:03.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  I went out for chow mein earlier when I wrote about wondering if I could eat.  I didn't order anything but the chow mein.  I shouldn't be tempted to eat *now*.

16:01.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  I was just so distracted by a mysterious desire to eat that I went into the kitchen looking for food, and I opened the bread to start preparing myself a sandwich.  I then closed the bread.  I am not yet "hungry".  There is a sense of need for food that isn't *there* yet.

16:02.  These logs give a sense of how often it happens that I feel driven to eat even though I don't need food.  If I ate something at every one of these prompts, it's very clear why I would gain weight.

16:03.  Also, I have been working for about six hours.  5,950 words on the book.

16:48.  DRIVE.  TO.  EAT.  I almost went for sugar!  Why do I want food so much, so often?

16:50.  It has been 46.5 hours since I started attempt #4 at quitting sweets.  I feel like I should reward myself with something for not eating sweets.

16:59.  I didn't actually reward myself with anything.  6,418 words on the book.  I'm over-quota, but dissatisfied.  I should put in a little more work.

17:00.  6,420 words on the book.  I decided to create a chapter break, which pads the word count by two words every time.

23:01.  7,239 words on the book.  I haven't been working at it constantly for this time.  I stopped a while ago and I just realized, "Hey, it's 11 PM, I better update my word count for the day."  I've been intending to go right back to writing for the last two hours straight...  I've been out of the task for at least that long, and half an hour more than that, because I was drawn away to shower.  3,196 words of progress.
