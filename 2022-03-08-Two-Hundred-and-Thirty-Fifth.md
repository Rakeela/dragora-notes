I was contemplating two things in parallel earlier today, and I want to share those thoughts.

The first of those two things is that I have two ideas for pornographic novels.  One of them I will eventually write if I am able, even if it is unpublishable.  It's too important to me; the pornographic content in the novel's concept is not the point, and I *might* minimize it.  The other one would be harder to minimize the pornographic content of and I will probably not write it.  I will come back to the reason why.

The second of those two things is that I bought editing services for my one complete manuscript.  From the feedback I've gotten back, "developmental editing" now strikes me as utterly essential.  It's vital for me to understand how other people would perceive the novel.

The pornographic novel that I will not write, is one that I believe I will not write because of how hard it would be to find a developmental editor for it.  I would want the entire manuscript to go through the eyes of someone other than myself who would provide feedback on how to redraft it to improve its quality, and I don't think I know the first thing about how to find someone who can provide a dev-edit on pornographic material.

Neither novel concept is intended to be purely mindless "fap" material, and I would want it to be intelligent (and intelligible) to an audience that wasn't masturbating to it.  Both stories have in concept an essential emotional drama that I doubt I can bring forward entirely on my own.  They would be bolstered greatly by a dev-editor, but both of them are at risk of never having one.
