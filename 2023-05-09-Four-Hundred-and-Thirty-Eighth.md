It's 1:04 PM, or 13:04, and I haven't started on my daily writing.  I had a lot of trouble getting up this morning.  Even once I did, I soon fell back asleep.  I've been getting stressed even though I've been doing "nothing".  Hours have passed and I can't account for them.  It's not lost time, it's just... empty time.  I guess this is poor executive function?  I've been feeling for hours like I need an energy drink, so I'm going to go to the store and buy energy drinks.  I don't drink them after 3 PM, or 15:00, so I'd better get to them now.  The day is wasting.

Upon returning from the store, I discovered that I skipped my morning energy drink this morning.  What an error!  That surely contributed to my lack of alertness.

I found Seattle Chocolate Carrot Cake chocolates!  They were at the Ben Franklin.  The crafts store is an unusual place to raid for candies, but I knew they had some, and I thought they might have things that QFC doesn't.  I was right!  I've had the Seattle Chocolate Carrot Cake bars before, and they're amazing.  I bought one from QFC once, and then I went back and bought the rest of their stock.  That's how I know how good they are.  Unfortunately, when I'd cleared out QFC, they didn't restock.  That was all I got of this amazing bar... until I thought today to check Ben Franklin!

I went hunting again for books on Manichaeanism or Zoroastrianism.  There doesn't seem to be any modern interest in them.  This book on the Silk Road is telling me as much about Manichaeanism as I have ever known.  I guess it is the obscure things that catch my eye.  I envision worlds of twenty thousand gods - a characteristic shared between Theoma and Tekhnevia.
