#xenomitochondria

Xenomitochondria are [[mitochondria]] in an organism from an organism other than the organism which bears them.  I think the technical term is "allotransplanted mitochondria," but I like the sound of "xenomitochondria".  It emphasizes the search for interspecific advantage through mitochondrial preferencing.

I think xenomitochondrial engineering for superior health and metabolism may become a new front in medicine and agricultural research.  It will be a new kind of transgenic modification specialized in a component of all eukaryotic metabolisms on Earth: mitochondria.  Mitochondria have their own genelines, and different species have differently adapted mitochondria.

As with a lot of my big ideas, but especially the ones in biotech, I have the attitude that I'll get into it if I have to, but I'm okay with the fact that I still have to study for several years.  If someone else pushes ahead of me very effectively, I will get to live in a more prosperous, healthy world as a result of that.

This stuff goes under [[authors-nonfiction]], doesn't it?  I'm intimidated by the scale of the reorganization task of my notes.
