Oh god, I don't think I'm going to watch this one all the way through.  I'm a few minutes in and this is constant cringe.

Okay, bad opening, but it got a little better.  Maybe I can stick this one out.  Kind of a low scorer.

Nevermind, it got worse again.  Too much property damage.  This is the kind of comedy movie that I dislike.

Ugh, it's bad.

Yeah, I'm not watching this one all the way through.  I watched 27 minutes of it.  It was rude and there was too much violence in the game.
