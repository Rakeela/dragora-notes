#2024-02-29-Seven-Hundred-and-Thirteenth

19:33.  All day today has been special because of the leap year.  I love February 29th.  I've just been basking in the glory of this calendaric anomaly.

20:01.  I just...  feel love today.  I don't want to work.  I want to bask in the feeling of love.  I'll work more later.
