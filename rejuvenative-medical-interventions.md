# Rejuvenative Medical Interventions

One of the key aspects of [[immortalist]] research has to be medical rejuvenation.  Even if the end goal of immortalism is assumed to be brain uploading (not a universal presumption, though I respect it), I believe that achieving life extension is a necessary precondition to uploading technologies, because of the extensively controlled bio-interfaces that we'll need.  We'll have to be able to rejuvenate the brain in order to make uploading work!  If we have to rejuvenate the brain, that should be the hardest tissue to rejuvenate, so we may as well make the rest of the body's tissues immortal as well.  That will help more people from an earlier generation live long enough to be part of the immortal generation, too.
