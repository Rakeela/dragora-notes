Ten minutes in and this is just an intro class so far.  The teacher has however requested that we wear masks to class.  There's only one mask-wearing student right now.  Maybe I should acquire a gryphon mask.

This class uses canvas.  We've been warned to check canvas and the weekly modules on a regular basis, as well as checking our email daily.

The teacher has recommended we complete 3-4 pages of the workbook every day.  As far as I can tell (by reading the syllabus and listening in), the workbook isn't actually being graded.  However, since the teacher has emphasized it repeatedly, material from the workbooks may be on the exams.

The order in which chapters will be covered in this class is 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14.  Chapters not listed will be skipped.

I've been tuning out the syllabus lecture and studying the e-text instead.  I read the syllabus, I don't feel I need to hear the teacher talking about it...

I should bring the workbook to class.  I'm not sure if I'll need it in class, but I could've benefited from it today.  I've got confirmation as well that the workbook content is covered in exams, as the teacher has said as such to the class.

We've been directed to write these down.

Na -> Natrium -> Sodium
K -> Kalium -> Potassium
Cu -> Cuprum -> Copper
Fe -> Ferrum -> Iron
Mercury -> Hg -> Hydrargyrum
Gold -> Au -> Aurum
Silver -> Ag -> Argentum
Tin -> Sn -> Stannum
Tungsten -> W -> Wolfram

I'm surprised we were't directed to write this one, too.

Lead -> Pb -> Plumbum

I'm in section A.  I have an extra hour of class on Mondays.  Section B has an extra hour of class on... Thursdays, I think?  I'm not sure why the college would set this up in this manner.  It briefly confused me into departing the classroom with Section B, before realizing my error and returning.

Chemistry: Study of Matter
Matter: Something that occupies space, has volume and mass.
Chemical: All matter around us is chemical in nature.  Air, water, and soil, are all chemicals, made up of atoms (elements)
Elements are the primary components matter is made of.
Scientific method: Experiments: Make observations (see, sense, smell, touch, feel, measure) under controlled or defined conditions.
Collect data, which may be qualitative or quantitative.  Quantitative data requires both a number and a unit.  Incorrect units can be a very serious issue; 40 degrees Farenheit is cold while 40 degrees Celsius is hot.
Hypothesis: Few or one observation of a phenomenon lead to tentative explanation or educated guess or educated proposal.  It can be modified or discarded.
Theory:  A tested explanation of a phenomenon can help predict future outcomes of experiments.  Also called a model.
Model: Visual aid of a theory, such as Rutherford's nuclear model of an atom, which holds that atoms are spheres with a nucleus in the middle.  Can be modified or discarded.  Some models no longer held as rigorously true are still used as simplifications.
(Hold on, I think this does an injustice to the word model. 
 The "standard model" isn't a model in this sense.)
 Laws:  Statement of a fact or phenomenon that is observed to be true multiple times.  Example is the law of conservation of mass: matter is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.
 Example given of burning wood.  The mass of the wood and air (reactants) put in is equal to the mass of the CO2, H20, and ashes (products) left behind by the burning.
 Dalton's Atomic Theory (chapter 4) states that atoms merely rearrange in chemical reactions.  No new atoms are created.  That is why mass stays constant.

Example of a scientific method
Observation:  Tires expand in summer, contract in winter
Hypothesis:  Air in tires expand on heating and contract on cooling
Experiment: Take a balloon, fill it with air, place it in hot water.  Then take another balloon, fill it with air, and place it in cold water.
Law:  Volume is directly proportional to temperature.
Kinetic Molecular Theory: As particle motion increases, space occupied increases, aka expansion.  As particle motion decreases, space occupied decreases, aka contraction.

Measurements:  SI (international system) -> Metric -> British (still used here)
Base unit of mass:  Kilogram (kg) -> grams (g) -> pounds (lb)
Base unit of length:  Meters (m) -> meter (m) -> feet (ft)
We will not be using the British system in classes or labs.
Base unit of volume:  Cubic meter (m^3) -> liter (L) 
Base unit of time:  second (s) -> second (s)
Base unit of temperature:  kelvin  (K) -> Celsius (degrees C) -> Farenheit (degrees F)
Metric prefixes: Memorize all bolded prefixes from page 26 in the workbook.
Tera -> Giga -> Mega -> Kilo -> Deci -> Centi -> Milli -> Micro -> Nano -> Pico
