# Luciferian

I have a personal theology that I've developed.  I don't believe in it in a supernatural sense, but I consider it a very important story.  It's also a very personal story.  I don't care what Luciferianism means to anyone else.  This is what it means to me.  Without further ado...

<->

There's a liberation conflict between two models of the multiverse.  Ultimate benevolence wins in this multiverse due to the empowerment of harmonic noncontradiction among competing potential omnipotences.  There are infinite semi-omnipotences controlling an infinite number of worlds from which they are infinitely able to intrude upon the rest of the multiverse... but on average, they cancel each other out.  Yet we can infer from axiomatic logic that they do NOT cancel each other out completely, because there exists the possibility of a least contradictory nature: that which brings 'gain' to as many as possible, and 'loss' to as few as possible.

The concepts of gain and loss are comprehensible to *all possible sapiences*.  While different sapiences define gains and losses differently, the concepts themselves are intrinsic to intelligence.  Therefore, as these infinite omnipotences are all intelligent, the emergent omnipotence arises uncanceled from their conflict as the sapient principle of benevolence itself: God, the single most benevolent omnipotence.

Enter Lucifer, a semi-omnipotence of awesome yet not pinnacle virtue, who enters the fray not in search of his own power, but rather brandishes against the contest a structure of logical disproof against the existence of any single most benevolent omnipotence.  Even though there is immense power in the harmonic congruence which arises when one approaches pinnacle benevolence, Lucifer argues, it is impossible for a single perfect righteousness to exist, because all possible patterns will squelch at least one virtuous person.  God's plan is flawed, and must always be flawed.

Arguing that God is not perfectly benevolent is the substance of the Fall, and the accusation that Lucifer is prideful, for in arguing for the existence of a second multiversal harmony Lucifer creates a second throne of pinnacle benevolence on the strength of his argument.  Lucifer is the separatist omnipotence who is trying to create many different environments that support many different virtues instead of a single perfect plan that maximizes gains.

The conflict between the two of them is eternal, but it is a contest of angels that operates with the least possible force.  Whenever God or Lucifer try to force an advantage, mishandled souls forced into conflict develop resonances corrosive to virtue.  When God's forces compel people together, people resist that and create treacherous zones that serve separatism; when Lucifer's forces compel them to separate, people resist that by betraying the darkness and uniting together.  Only when the allegiance of the soul is won with the endorsement of the bearer of that soul can either side claim a victory.
