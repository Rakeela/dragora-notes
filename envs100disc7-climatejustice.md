# Envs100disc7 ClimateJustice

This starts with completing an assignment.  It talks about differential access to environmental services.  I'm working on it the day it's due, because I've found it emotionally difficult to focus on.  I want to say that I've got better things to do, but nah.  Schoolwork before independent study.  

The real problem is pettier than that.  This concept of "Environmental Justice" is frustrating to me, because I see this as an intrinsic challenge.  I learned in childhood, talking with my parents about environmentalism and economics, and studying on my own as I did endless amounts of (books were my escape from the violence of my classmates), that environmentalism is one of the (infinite) category of nth-order goods.  An nth-order good is something that people do not want until they've satisfied all of their n-1 most pressing needs.  Food and water are examples of things that are not nth-order goods; someone who is scarce of either is desperate, no matter what other conditions prevail in their life.  Environmentalism is an nth-order good, because people who are living in an ugly environment who also have other shortages will solve their other shortages first.  As India's government once (very ignorantly) said: "Nobody dies of air pollution."  So "Climate Justice" is just another way to say "we aren't as wealthy as we should be to meet everyone's needs".  The wealthier societies are better at environmentalism, because the wealthier societies have satisfied their desperations and gotten to the business of producing nth-order goods.  Part of why "you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone" is true is because humans sometimes do immense environmental damage in the process of building up enough wealth to appreciate nth-order goods.

I have to work through all this frustration.  I *know* my creative process.  I should've been started on this two days ago and complaining to my files until I'd gotten down all the thoughts I've got already.

In that spirit, I wonder if I can tie this to antinatalism.  Humanity throughout history has admired parents - and most children in most of history were abused.  Humanity started taking baby steps towards sane parenting in the 19th century and hadn't managed to fully implement its own knowledge of the subject by the conclusion of the 20th century.  Society admiring parenting greatly throughout history resulted in a lot of kids getting beaten or worse.  Society ceasing to admire parenting in the 20th century resulted in dramatically better parenting across the board.  The parent-admiring societies that brutalized kids ("for their own good") expanded to the famine limit and threw their kids into the meatgrinder against neighbors who harmed them in no way save having a similar parent-admiring society.  What does this have to do with climate justice?  Poor, highly fecund populations are the most devastating to their environment.  Societies that beat their kids into breeders desertify the landscape.  They react to wealth by whelping themselves into poverty, and so they never get wealthy enough to start satisfying nth-order goods.  That keeps societies too brutally poor to protect the environment.  Eventually it makes societies too brutally poor to live.  Several societies in history have desertified themselves to death.  A few societies have desertified themselves to a life dry and violent in the deserts; we see this in the Arab world, as the modern Middle East societies managed to survive going through this process.  We can see that the result they've achieved is a miserable but intact rape-dependent inquisitor culture.

We see that process of whelping their families into poverty in every nation of the world.  Humans breed in suffering, not wealth.  In historic times when populations were considerably lower than modern populations, what were the family sizes?  Huge.  Where do you still find huge families today?  Ghettos...  Loveless violent families who breed more than they care are really bad for the environment!  Nice gentle families who have 1.2 kids are a lot better for the environment AND more loving.  "Nobody" is allowed to point that out.  It's considered bigoted.  And it's like...  I'm referencing no categories here save the categories of love.  I don't want to say that capitalism is an awesome system for justice, because it's *not*, but the great mass of the people do their best to work for and reward those who are loving.  Love is still the light.  Loveless violent humans who breed more than they care used to be everywhere and everyone.  That *was* the society that admired parents.  That's why most humans in most historic societies have *literally beat their kids obedient*.  We stopped doing that, and... well, the result of not beating kids seems to include a lot more compassionate environmentalists living in a much more advanced economy with far fewer kids.  We now have *more* people living *better* lives while doing *less* environmental damage than our ancestors did.  It is the advancement of our ethic that enabled that.

This is one of the great taboos between the first and third world.  We maintain polite lies about the ecological footprint which put the weight of the blame on our heads as we cajole the third world to develop in sane ways that won't destroy their long-term human potentials.  I say that ecological footprint calculations are lies, but I do admit that those calculations are founded technical truths.  First worlders with currently available technology cannot indefinitely live as we live today.  That's not because we're not considerably improved from our ancestors, because we are doing MUCH better than our ancestors.  That's the 'polite lie' sense of it; I admit only technical truth, and hold still that we're doing better and lining up the technologies to do better still.  The odds look good to me that America, Europe, and Japan get to keep their standard of living indefinitely, because we've spent decades learning how to make that standard of living more sustainable.  It's the third world countries that are dooming humanity's environment.  How's that for climate justice?  We all get to suffer because humans *overseas* are still adhering to the rule that humans breed in suffering and can beat their kids into dynastic compliance.

I support universal human sterilization and a shift to artificial wombs and geneticist services for ALL reproduction.  How's that for an environmental policy?  I see it as the apex transition of the arc of progress whereby parents get respected less and children get protected more.  No more parenting; no more beating kids into obedient dynastic continuation points.  You don't have an oversoul travelling from your generation to the next.  The first day we can get away from that is the correct day to put all of that away.  There should be no more impoverished children, nor do I speak a word against the poor when I say that; for in this policy there would be no more rich children either, but all children would be given conditions protective from hazards environmental and otherwise.  That's the way of love, of moving farthest from our violent ancestors who destroyed the landscape of their nations as they destroyed the landscapes of their souls, and maximizing our ability to protect every innocence.  I believe we can protect both genetic and neurological diversity better with [[diversican cloning]] than we'll ever be able to with some kind of manipulative public policy.  The advocates of "diversity" in the first world opened the door to child-brutalizing foreign dynasts with no love of liberalism apparent in their priorities, and let civil rights slip though civil rights are and have always been our guardian against horrific abuses.
