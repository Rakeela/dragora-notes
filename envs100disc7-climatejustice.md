# Envs100disc7 ClimateJustice

This starts with completing an assignment.  It talks about differential access to environmental services.  I'm working on it the day it's due, because I've found it emotionally difficult to focus on.  I want to say that I've got better things to do, but nah.  Schoolwork before independent study.  

The real problem is pettier than that.  This concept of "Environmental Justice" is frustrating to me, because I see this as an intrinsic challenge.  I learned in childhood, talking with my parents about environmentalism and economics, and studying on my own as I did endless amounts of (books were my escape from the violence of my classmates), that environmentalism is one of the (infinite) category of nth-order goods.  An nth-order good is something that people do not want until they've satisfied all of their n-1 most pressing needs.  Food and water are examples of things that are not nth-order goods; someone who is scarce of either is desperate, no matter what other conditions prevail in their life.  Environmentalism is an nth-order good, because people who are living in an ugly environment who also have other shortages will solve their other shortages first.  As India's government once (very ignorantly) said: "Nobody dies of air pollution."  So "Climate Justice" is just another way to say "we aren't as wealthy as we should be to meet everyone's needs".  The wealthier societies are better at environmentalism, because the wealthier societies have satisfied their desperations and gotten to the business of producing nth-order goods.  Part of why "you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone" is true is because humans sometimes do immense environmental damage in the process of building up enough wealth to appreciate nth-order goods.

I have to work through all this frustration.  I *know* my creative process.  I should've been started on this two days ago and complaining to my files until I'd gotten down all the thoughts I've got already.

In that spirit, I wonder if I can tie this to antinatalism.  Humanity throughout history has admired parents - and most children in most of history were abused.  Humanity started taking baby steps towards sane parenting in the 19th century and hadn't managed to fully implement its own knowledge of the subject by the conclusion of the 20th century.  Society admiring parenting greatly throughout history resulted in a lot of kids getting beaten or worse.  Society ceasing to admire parenting in the 20th century resulted in dramatically better parenting across the board.  The parent-admiring societies that brutalized kids ("for their own good") expanded to the famine limit and threw their kids into the meatgrinder against neighbors who harmed them in no way save having a similar parent-admiring society.  What does this have to do with climate justice?  Poor, highly fecund populations are the most devastating to their environment.  Societies that beat their kids into breeders desertify the landscape.  They react to wealth by whelping themselves into poverty, and so they never get wealthy enough to start satisfying nth-order goods.  That keeps societies too brutally poor to protect the environment.  Eventually it makes societies too brutally poor to live.  Several societies in history have desertified themselves to death.  A few societies have desertified themselves to a life dry and violent in the deserts; we see this in the Arab world, as the modern Middle East societies managed to survive going through this process.  We can see that the result they've achieved is a miserable but intact rape-dependent inquisitor culture.

We see that process of whelping their families into poverty in every nation of the world.  Humans breed in suffering, not wealth.  In historic times when populations were considerably lower than modern populations, what were the family sizes?  Huge.  Where do you still find huge families today?  Ghettos...  Loveless violent families who breed more than they care are really bad for the environment!  Nice gentle families who have 1.2 kids are a lot better for the environment AND more loving.  "Nobody" is allowed to point that out.  It's considered bigoted.  And it's like...  I'm referencing no categories here save the categories of love.  I don't want to say that capitalism is an awesome system for justice, because it's *not*, but the great mass of the people do their best to work for and reward those who are loving.  Love is still the light.  Loveless violent humans who breed more than they care used to be everywhere and everyone.  That *was* the society that admired parents.  That's why most humans in most historic societies *have literally beat their kids obedient*.  We stopped doing that, and... well, the result of not beating kids seems to include a lot more compassionate environmentalists living in a much more advanced economy with far fewer kids.  We now have *more* people living *better* lives while doing *less* environmental damage than our ancestors did.  It is the advancement of our ethic that enabled that.

This is one of the great taboos between the first and third world.  We maintain polite lies about the ecological footprint which put the weight of the blame on our heads as we cajole the third world to develop in sane ways that won't destroy their long-term human potentials.  I say that ecological footprint calculations are lies, but I do admit that those calculations are founded technical truths.  First worlders with currently available technology cannot indefinitely live as we live today.  That's not because we're not considerably improved from our ancestors, because we are doing MUCH better than our ancestors.  That's the 'polite lie' sense of it; I admit only technical truth, and hold still that we're doing better and lining up the technologies to do better still.  The odds look good to me that America, Europe, and Japan get to keep their standard of living indefinitely, because we've spent decades learning how to make that standard of living more sustainable.  It's the third world countries that are dooming humanity's environment.  How's that for climate justice?  We all get to suffer because humans *overseas* are still adhering to the rule that humans breed in suffering and can beat their kids into dynastic compliance.

I support universal human sterilization and a shift to artificial wombs and geneticist services for ALL reproduction.  How's that for an environmental policy?  I see it as the apex transition of the arc of progress whereby parents get respected less and children get protected more.  No more parenting; no more beating kids into obedient dynastic continuation points.  You don't have an oversoul travelling from your generation to the next.  The first day we can get away from that is the correct day to put all of that away.  There should be no more impoverished children, nor do I speak a word against the poor when I say that; for in this policy there would be no more rich children either, but all children would be given conditions protective from hazards environmental and otherwise.  That's the way of love, of moving farthest from our violent ancestors who destroyed the landscape of their nations as they destroyed the landscapes of their souls, and maximizing our ability to protect every innocence.  I believe we can protect both genetic and neurological diversity better with [[diversican cloning]] someday than we'll ever be able to with some kind of manipulative public policy.  The advocates of "diversity" in the first world opened the door to child-brutalizing foreign dynasts with no love of liberalism apparent in their priorities, and let civil rights slip though civil rights are and have always been our guardian against horrific abuses.

...I don't want to hold back development from other countries.  Far from it.  I want them to develop until they get far enough into nth-order goods to start honestly protecting the environment they live in and the vulnerable members of their populations.  The great struggle for development is that it has to *overrun* natalism.  In order for environmentalism to take root in a population, *development must first exceed natalism*.  If development never overruns natalism, humans keep breeding in suffering and dying of it.  There's a necessary acceleration which kicks humanity into seeking nth-order goods rather than breeding in desperation, and compassionate efficiency along with *everything else that makes life worth living* is an nth-order good.  This goes back to eco-industrialism for me.  There are all these societies on Earth that never got *the kick* and still exist in a sociopathic ancestral mode.  Environmentalism will fail if it can't figure out how to bootstrap development levels far enough fast enough that people start to value living in this world more than reproducing in this world.  That's climate justice as I understand it to be true, and that's climate justice as I can't present it to a university environment.

The presentation associated with the homework that is this assignment's first dependency is focused on local county policy, not world justice.  I'm actually a little miffed by the localism, too.  I'm not enthused by filling out a compulsory survey to file details of my personal life with my environmental sciences teacher.  It looks like there's something of a worksheet, and I should assemble its own document for that.  So, therefore:  [[envs100week7homework-ClimateJustice]]

I'm demoralized trying to do this assignment.  The university already has my address, I believe.  Yet I have to compile a bunch of environmental quality information about my home and publish it to the teacher.  I don't want to do that.  It's an interesting skill and I understand it as an information-acquisition exercise which I could do for future potential living environments, and yet...

It actually feels supremacist, too.  The whole exercise.  I would say the long-term reason why climate justice issues exist is because development hasn't universally overran natalism.  Yet I would say that the immediate reason why climate justice issues exist is because poor and disabled people have to live in places which have priced in discounts for bad environmental quality, and I don't foresee *myself* as ever having to live in a bad area unless I do it voluntarily.  I feel especially bad for the disabled, and not only because I myself have disabling medical conditions that provoke sympathy with that population, but because they can be forced to live in bad areas even if they aren't contributing to the long-term causes of bad areas existing.  Yet I'm rich, both globally and vs the domestic population of other disabled people.  I identify as philosophically hedonistic, but my idea of pleasure is so wholly textual that I'm essentially a wealthy ascetic.  I don't even consider myself to own things, but I'm hardly poor...  I can't use this information to help anyone, even those whose plight is worsened by woes similar to mine.  All I can do is affirm my relative advantage.  I have sufficient access to resources that I can maintain my current standard of living for the indefinite future, but...  I couldn't even *opt* for a lower standard of living.  The circumstances of my life are something of a gilded cage.  What can I do with this information but be confronted with problems against which I am helpless and the fact that people I would rather help are likely to hate me?

The area where I live is a great swathe of relative advantage, too.  Redmond is full of trees and low in traffic.  Industrialism is both well-regulated and technologically advanced in this area.  What am I supposed to do to make things better - take a trashbag out for a stroll of volunteer litter-picking?  That's a real question.  I make no regular practice of it, but I've done that before.  Growing up, I was roughly rebuked for doing that, as supposedly cleaning up places took work away from janitors and sanitation workers...  I was very confused by the sternness by which I was met for cleaning up other peoples' messes!  It seems like there's plenty of work to be done, and that work is intrinsically unpleasant enough that more hands only makes lighter work of it.  The pastor at the church encouraged me to keep cleaning up areas as I could, one of the many reasons for which I loved him.  (He was so unlike the rest of the people in the area.)  I haven't been likewise rebuked in adulthood, though a confused police officer did once stop to ask me what I was doing.  I noticed that the local government and local businesses put in more effort after I did, too.  Far from taking work away from sanitation, I felt like I was encouraging sanitation work to be considered more of a respectable necessity in my area.  <3  Yet does it amend environmental justice issues in some way?  I already live somewhere wealthy.  My area is already mostly clean, and if it weren't, it's not like I would expect to impact airborne particulate concentrations just by picking up debris.  I don't have the skills, equipment, or institutional backing to accomplish more than that.

1) The whole fitness fixation seems like it ignores the medical interventions needed to make fitness reasonable.  People already know fitness is valuable.  They're already putting as much effort as they can sustain into it.  People who hate the unfit are the primary reason the unfit exist at all; a society governed by morphological freedom perogatives instead would have neither hatred for the unfit *nor* the unfit themselves, and it would "eliminate" the unfit entirely productively by fixing their problems.  People who aren't fit when morphological freedom prevails are doing something they'd rather be doing - that's how it is *anyways*, but if changing the body was given the proper medical support infrastructure that it actually requires, observed reality would start to conform to people's expectations of what an empowered reality looks like.  It's the unproductively stoic and anti-hedonological arrangement of society which results in a society of fat miserable people and thin miserable people broken hostile to fat people for no particular reason.  Unfitness is monstrously expensive and the magical thinking of the people who are already fit isn't cutting it as a solution.  If they want to buy a world where people get thin, they have to yield up the resources needed to fix a monstrously expensive problem, because the people who *have* that problem *by definition* do not already have the resources to fix it.  Wishing, screaming, and victimizing the "noncompliant" just makes people fatter, because it very logically results in more of the public *not having the resources to fix a monstrously expensive problem*.
2) As far as park access, I don't know what I'd change.  Park access looks pretty good in my area.  This is a scientific problem, not a parkland problem.
3) I don't think the system is implemented honestly.  My immediate intuition is that the data is corrupted and being utilized in an anti-scientific manner as a way of advertising localities rather than validly sharing information about them.  I don't feel like I learned anything about my county's environmental risks.  Instead I learned that my blatantly very white area is rated as having a high density of scary hazardous black people.  Since I've seen black people about as often in this area as I saw them in the also-very-white rural area where I grew up, I assume that's a lie intended to discourage local colonization by racists who've had the strength and compassion emasculated out of them in favor of obedient racial sociopathy.  Now, I understand that racists are a violently unstable category of humanity and I get that we don't want those people in any particular area, but exploiting their fears with dishonesty feels like revictimizing some of the people who've already had their coping skills most totally victimized off of them by society.  Racists are pretty far into mental health decay, and there's got to be a more compassionate solution than lying to them about the conditions of society so that they don't trouble economically important areas.  Really though, I'm just complaining because the unexpected "that can't be right" number in the review made me disinterested in looking up the other numbers...  If the rest of it is honest, but that one measure got massaged, the visibly massaged number is still impairing comprehension of the rest of it.
4) Natural spaces are big!  Creating a society where everyone has access to natural spaces is very much like trying to create a society where everyone has access to the grounds of a mansion!  If humanity had few enough people and a sufficient amount of wealth that everyone could literally live in mansions, endless great rambling trails would form up without the faintest central subsidy or regulation.  Instead we've got a species that has often housed its most exuberantly 'familial' groups in tiny apartments.  If I thought humanity had limitless resources, I would actually complain that maybe the people who don't *want* to live with mansions worth of space dedicated to them should be supported in their right to live as they'd prefer... in which case disparities of access to natural space would simply reflect that some people would rather live in shacks made out of their family members or something.  Visualize that at your own peril.  I *do* think humanity has limited resources, and that this requires some amount of preferencing for the mansion-and-grounds preference structure as the one which is ironically easier to sustain on an Earth-accessible resource budget, but I really struggle to see this as a justice issue.  Frankly, the fact that I have four sisters points up the injustice of my own birth.  Families that big are intrinsically unhealthy and shouldn't exist.
5) Poor people don't have the resources to get through quarantine safely, they're targeted by all of society as the ones at fault for everything, and they've often had bad experiences with the systems that should be helping people, which rather than becoming a reform impetus for the services to help the destitute ends up becoming yet another proof that people are poor because they're useless ingrates who don't respect people trying to help them.  The total effect is more like "helping" than helping.  I get that I'm supposed to be talking about particulate pollution's impacts on lung health here, but I think the fact that poor people exist at the point of every spear in society is a way more significant contributor.  You'd think cutting people was a public service by how much society disrespects the poor.  Nobody is productive when they're treated like shit.  This is part of what makes rich families generationally successful (they're not treated like shit) and it's part of the basic insight which empowered unions (as long as they're really just demanding decent treatment, most of society will understand why they're being unproductive and intransigent).  How did our society just *forget* that?
6) The most productive lens here is probably economic efficiency.  The ecologically protected societies have their present productivity protected and their future productivity set on a probable positive trajectory.  Extending this to the protection of the poor in society, focusing on the productivity-enhancing potential of good conditions suggests that environmental justice can be a source of cost-effective egalitarianism.  Focusing environmental gains on the wealthy makes sense in pure market terms because those populations are the ones who are far into the nth-order curve where they start satisfying more minor concerns, yet in terms of concentrated economic reward the effort spent maintaining clean environments around the poor (who have more to gain and fewer resources with which to buy productivity enhancement) is more efficient than the effort spent to maintain clean environments around the rich (who already have advantaged productivity and who are already going about the business of buying their own further productivity enhancements).  
 

So I obviously can't post any of this directly to class.  I'd have to do a lot of study to validate my intuitions to even be comfortable with this assignment.  It looks like #6 comes nearest to an acceptable orthodox handling of the assignment and would involve the least stress generally, so that one is in.  The rest of this is four live wires and #2 where my answer is, "Eh?  This need already looks well-satisfied in my area."

Bleeeeh.  I need something to post by midnight and I'm not sure I'll have it.

I feel stressed by not understanding the obligatory acceptable perspective on this one.  It somehow blurs into the general trauma of history for me.  How can so many people have suffered so much and still produced so much beauty?  Humanity has been powerless in so many ways across so many different times and places, and fluctuations in the natural world have so often been the driver of that.  The link that I suspect between human fecundity and poverty is made of raw existential horror to me and it makes of this question something akin to being tasked at staring into the abyss.  Human societies have sometimes terminally overgrown their environment's carrying capacity, and then fell straining as everyone in their environment must eventually have been afflicted with terrible environmental conditions.  This is what I think about when I think about edge cases throughout society.  The biggest issues have to be dealt with to prevent everything from becoming an edge case, because the edge cases in the environment *don't* hold back humanity until they proliferate enough to break the economy.

My thoughts on this are tangled...  I feel splayed unnaturally between the global perspective, the historic perspective, and the local perspectives of a billion petty errors in human environmental planning.  Actually, I can use that as raw material.  There's something there.  Environmentalism has a scale problem.  A stretch of sooty sidewalk on Backstreet Boulevard is an environmentalism issue, and so is the question of whether or not we should pump aerosols into the atmosphere to alter solar absorption and cloud formation pattern.  It's actually stressful to relate these two to each other, isn't it?  Yet I'm not saying that they're *not* both environmentalism issues, because as I understand it they *are*...  Why is that stressful?  I feel like I had the answer, and then I lost it, but the recognition of a stressful dichotomy remains.  Environmental justice is localist.  It's a headache.

There's even some rationale in capitalism to "environmental injustice".  There's so much stuff that we have to put *somewhere*.  Doesn't it make sense to pay out a yield to the people who are willing to tolerate living near the stuff that people would rather avoid living near?  If I reject the anti-capitalist social pressure that the teacher applied to the exercise, I could argue that any economic system needs some method of discounting which achieves collective consequentialist advantages through industrial deployments.  Capitalism does this naturally in its property rights system with public valuations supported by the extensive publicly available information in the modern market.  Other systems would need other methods.  I doubt anybody would be particularly satisfied with a system that allotted homes by a lottery that "fairly distributes" exposure to industrial hazards, so what is actually supposed to be done here?

Alternatively...  I could argue for the installation of more public air-filtration systems in urban areas?  Plant-based air filtration systems intercept noise pollution (vs industrial air filtration which is noisy) and fuel a "green high-tech" appearance.  Although, wouldn't those just get vandalized and destroyed?  Trees aren't as powerful as purpose-designed hardware, but they don't require a high level of public order to maintain them.  People mostly won't kick people out of society for hurting trees and yet they also mostly won't hurt trees.  Trees just get forgotten about when people are trying to write in the books of their enemies.  The passivity of the peace between modern urbanized humans and trees is remarkable.  Truly the wisdom of trees must be great for them to achieve such a peace with a species such as humanity.  See, this goes to another reason why it's *easier* to provide better environments in some communities than it is in others.  Crime is a localist problem, too.  I've gotten the impression that where humans live in high densities, the odds that they will live near someone they hate go *way* up.  Trying to address *this* is yet another livewire.

Ugh.  This problem seems so hard that I don't want to say *anything* about it in a three paragraph discussion post that's expected to show some *basic* engagement with class.  I feel like my own archive is the only place that I *should* publish my twisted and ill-conceived thoughts on this, because I clearly don't know how to do it right.

So often have people died because they didn't know their unknowns.  This mirrors the sense that I get of nature, which is a thought that tends to drive me towards such a hard urbanism as to generate computronium sympathies: the environment is dominated in so many ways by overgrowth patterns that collectively correct into something vibrant, but though the result seems at so many moments beautiful, every one of those overgrowth corrections is a wall of death.  In a sapient context - as we must still dwell *within* the environment and with our minds feel only more keenly the awfulness of helplessness - every overgrowth correction is a wall of misery as well.

All those points where society is a wall of misery are points where something isn't correcting, aren't they?  They're the stifled regions.

Climate justice is a very difficult problem which goes to the heart of the moral justification of our economic system, even as it challenges the limits of integrity in our society.  <-- Something of a thesis statement.  I could use this exact sentence here somehow, I'm sure of it.

Hm...

Draft fragment(s):
For though it may seem unjust that those who already prosper gain the greatest benefit from environmentalism, consider also that those who do not prosper often have or reasonably believe themselves to have more urgent priorities than the environment.  Environmentalism is *expensive*.  The history books well attest that environmental stewardship is to the long-term health and prosperity of entire nations, and environmental destruction eventually tears down both health and prosperity alike; despite this, nobody really wants to think about how sooty sidewalks on Backstreet Boulevard might be affecting their productivity.  If someone is quite poor, that seems petty and depressing; they don't like a dirty environment either, but they don't have the time to spare.  Given our society's resentments against government, people of uncertain prosperity may not like being held accountable by broader society as some kind of 'taker-class'.  If they believe that the dignity of their life is being poorly served, they may not be at all pleased to have their neighborhoods marked as 'problems' that need to be 'cleaned up'.  Some people believe such designations have a dispiriting force of their own.

Shall we then, in our infinite wisdom, brandish the taxpayer's pocketbook at the threat of coughing poverty?  I'll confess also that there's an argument for it.  The people who have gained least are often the people with the most to gain.  The greater wisdom in society *is* sometimes correct.  An environmental clean-up program that succeeds swiftly and well more than sweeps away the embarrassment it causes.  I'm sure somewhere in America there's a rational and popular environmental justice program operating right now; I'm even more confident that there have been rational and popular urban environmentalism campaigns in the past.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's another one waiting to be found, perhaps many of them, waiting to be plucked like grapes from the vine by keen-eyed activists who know how to make cities into such better places to live that the programs pay for themselves in the potentials they unlock.

Is that appropriate here, in Bellevue?  I'm sure I don't know.  I tried to think about environmental justice, and the problem intimidated me with its complexity.  I felt ill-informed and intrusive just by thinking about it, as though I would need to have an entire degree in this subject before it would be right for me to talk about it.  In posing that challenge to me, writing this essay almost defeated me.

That's almost a draft.  It misses the sentence which inspired me to write draft fragments at all, and "for though it may seem unjust" is a difficult opening phrase.  It has a poetic sound, but it's not a proper opening.

Maybe they just need to be glued together... but the concept of integrity doesn't fit cleanly.  That was keying on my thought about how green infrastructure risks being ruined if implemented in impoverished areas, which are very often also high-crime areas.   How much buy-in can the government get from how many potential trouble-makers?  This is such a local judgment that I don't know what to say about it.  I'm sure that sometimes a carpetbagger sees the city's infrastructure catching on fire when someone who knows the area can make it look swiftly advancing, but how do I fit that with the rest of what I just drafted?  Environmentalism needs its global alliances, and too many of the people in the real world who would be best at making environmentalism happen for their city would be disastrous for making environmentalism happen for their *world*.  Ecofascism in Italy?  Dios, aiuta a me.  Perhaps that's why the localism/globalism split in environmentalism is such a pain and stressor.

I must carry on.  For now, I will exclude the difficult bit.

First draft:
Climate justice is a very difficult problem which goes to the heart of the moral justification of our economic system.  For though it may seem unjust that those who already prosper gain the greatest benefit from environmentalism, consider also that those who do not prosper often have or reasonably believe themselves to have more urgent priorities than the environment.  Environmentalism is *expensive*.  The history books well attest that environmental stewardship is to the long-term health and prosperity of entire nations, and environmental destruction eventually tears down both health and prosperity alike; despite this, and at the level at which this question of climate justice actually has to be contemplated, nobody really wants to think about how sooty sidewalks on Backstreet Boulevard might be affecting their productivity.  If someone isn't quite poor, it takes an economics PHD to explain to them how someone else's lung injuries are impacting *their* productivity.  If someone *is* quite poor, the idea that their dirty environment is injuring them must seem petty and depressing; just one more nuisance against which to feel powerless.  Who has time to spare for a problem that small when life is hard already?  Given our society's so-common resentments against government, people of uncertain prosperity may even resent programs that leave them being "held accountable" by broader society as some kind of deadweight "taker-class".  To this view, every unnecessary intervention is a kind of embarrassment that only makes it harder for them to stand on their own feet autonomously.  If people in the least attractive neighborhoods already feel that the dignity of their life is being poorly served, they may not feel much better to have their neighborhoods marked as "problems" that need to be "cleaned up".

Shall we still, in our infinite wisdom, brandish the taxpayer's pocketbook at the threat of coughing poverty?  I can also understand that there's an argument here for the public sector's attention.  The people who have gained least *are* often the people with the most to gain.  The greater wisdom in society *can* be correct.  An environmental clean-up program that succeeds swiftly and well more than sweeps away the embarrassment it causes.  I fully expect that every modern city over a certain size has the concern for its environment represented in its bureaucracy, its politics, and its long-term planning.

Is that appropriate here, in Bellevue?  I'm sure I don't know.  I confess to looking with trepidation and misgivings upon the source that we were given for finding comparative pollution levels.  Worse, I confess to burying live wires here; I blasted a tunnel through a small mountain of possible dramas before settling on a post that would call the whole affair into question.  For I *tried* to think about environmental justice, and the problem intimidated me with its complexity.  I felt ill-informed and intrusive just by thinking about it, as though I would need to have an entire degree in this subject before it would be right for me to talk about it.  In posing that challenge to me, writing this essay almost defeated me.  I respect environmental justice as a means of looking at city planning more than I did before I attempted to write this discussion post, but I feel too keenly the gap between what I know of this subject and what I could know if I dedicated a great sweep of research time towards becoming able to speak in a manner well-informed about the environmental challenges being faced by a specific city.

This is a true part of environmentalism, and yet this issue is so local that it is difficult to address.  It must be worked at a local scale.  I don't know that it's possible to have an opinion on this that is so true it stands globally, and I'm certain I don't know how to have one.

Now, how do I stick citations on that?  I'm booting the structure from the teacher's prompt, but I've gotten good rhetoric by booting it, and I expect the citation requirement to be the one more strictly enforced.  I need at least two.

The first draft isn't done until I've finished applying the [] marks to it, but I think this one might be done at 0.  Working over it to see what's citable reveals plenty of weak claims that would be difficult to substantiate.  Know-nothing rhetoric is better when it knows nothing, and this draft still knows too much as I'm tuning it.

---
Hm...  I'm afraid of ruining the text's prosody if I restrain it too much.  It's kind of pretty.  It is also a kind of obscured apology for falling short of academic intentions; I did *not* achieve the ability to speak academically swiftly enough to partake in the discussion board in the intended mode.  I wrote a know-nothing instead.  Hrm, but that makes me feel like adding citations is *cheating*!  Adding citations feels like a way to pretend I've done better than I have.  Modifying the draft to conclude with an apology admitting that it's not a proper engagement with the coursework would be better academic integrity.

The most honest thing of all might be to step back, go to bed, let the assignment fall past due, and write a more suitably engaged essay tomorrow.  That way I couldn't play on the teacher's sympathies to try to get a better grade - I would be compelling it to drop, as fits my own judgment of how I ought to be scored for submitting this travesty.  The problem with that idea is that doing that would be wrong, too.  Suitable engagement would represent what I consider ideal honesty either, as I don't trust the source that I'm supposed to be studying for the comparison data in the assignment as given.  The know-nothing also lodges such protest as exists within the bounds of socially acceptable discourse.  I am not however certain that protest is legitimate; can I rightly determine at what is very nearly the literal eleventh hour that I should be exempt from the stated instructions, without so much as an attempt to find different comparisons elsewhere or research backing the data given in this source?  Chasing the data to its sources is a critical part of learning in the university environment!

Yet *that* goes to the claim of respect in the closing paragraph of the know-nothing!  I *can* see how the research can be done, not at the level of the full gathering of information, but certainly at the level of checking the paper trail and learning which terms to study to learn about the conditions facing specific regions.  It doesn't look *small*.  I don't know how to do this *slightly*.  I *don't* know how to write a two-citation essay with any insight on this subject.  If I spend all of tomorrow on it, I'll spend all day studying something far from my own desires to turn in an overweight essay for half-value.  It's within the realm of the possible, but I'm not enthused by the prospect.

There's a more fundamental problem as well.  This know-nothing is *not amicable to the cause*.  My response to being told to study environmental justice is probably an example of something which an activist would encounter as an obstacle.  It calls into question the subject and makes arbitrary high demands on the minimum qualifications of its participants.  I want those arbitrary high demands to exist, because thinking about this left me feeling overwhelmed and underqualified, but I know that a college environment is not a place to *dwell* in that feeling.  It's a place to develop the skills needed to move beyond it.  I know that.  ...but what if...  Pfah!  The number of unknowns that I feel about this subject is extreme.

Can I trim out the bits which speculate about how people feel?  That's all stand-out uncitable.  It's stuff that would be really high impact if I could cite it, but I doubt I can get a quick unambiguous citation; broad claims about public sentiment in reaction to public programs are the rewards of a more serious review that would land in 'overweight essay' territory at a minimum.  How much of that can I just lose while still having something interesting to read?

Second draft:
Climate justice is a very difficult problem which goes to the heart of the moral justification of our economic system.  For though it may seem unjust that those who already prosper gain the greatest benefit from environmentalism, consider also that those who do not prosper often have or reasonably believe themselves to have more urgent priorities than the environment.  Environmentalism is *expensive*.  The history books well attest that environmental stewardship is to the long-term health and prosperity of entire nations, and environmental destruction eventually tears down both health and prosperity alike; despite this, and at the level at which this question of climate justice actually has to be contemplated, nobody really wants to think about how sooty sidewalks on Backstreet Boulevard might be affecting their productivity.  If someone isn't quite poor, it takes an economics PHD to explain to them how someone else's lung injuries are impacting *their* productivity.  If someone *is* quite poor, the idea that their dirty environment is injuring them must seem petty and depressing; just one more nuisance against which to feel powerless.  Who has time to spare for a problem that small when life is hard already?  The government of India once claimed, incorrectly yet sympathetically in a context of great poverty, "Nobody has ever died of air pollution."

Shall we still, in our infinite wisdom, brandish the taxpayer's pocketbook at the threat of coughing poverty?  I can also understand that there's an argument here for the public sector's attention.  The people who have gained least *are* often the people with the most to gain.  The greater wisdom in society *can* be correct.  An environmental clean-up program that succeeds swiftly and well more than sweeps away the embarrassment it causes.  I fully expect that every modern city over a certain size has the concern for its environment represented in its bureaucracy, its politics, and its long-term planning.

Is that appropriate here, in Bellevue?  I'm sure I don't know.  I confess to looking with trepidation and misgivings upon the source that we were given for finding comparative pollution levels.  Worse, I confess to burying live wires here; I blasted a tunnel through a small mountain of possible dramas before settling on a post that questions the subject.  For I *tried* to think about environmental justice, and the problem intimidated me with its complexity and breadth.  I felt ill-informed and intrusive just by thinking about it.  I feel like I'd need to be trying to achieve this as my degree to give it enough thought that I would feel like I could address the subject in a way that was wholly respectful to all involved.

The claim about the government of India doing something outré is pure citation generation fodder.  I think I remember something like that being a scandal at some point, but it's a placeholder for any sufficiently similar statement - that's a citation of the weight class this project needs for that discussion board, which conveys some of what it replaces.

I've been lightening this and refining it towards an aligned state.  I *would* prefer to produce something more allied to the cause, on the whole.  I'm very much concerned with anti-entropic organization.  I like clean environments and pro-health policies...  I'm not convinced that capitalism doesn't make grievous errors in leaving non-obvious needs unmet.  I don't think a pure capitalist market would've banned leaded gasoline.  Environmentalism *is* expensive... enough so that it's difficult to fix undervaluation errors.

Maybe if I edit the draft to better reflect my concern, here...  That also tightens up the ending.

The first paragraph is still totally dissatisfying, but I think I want to change it enough that I should label my next draft for the changes rather than further editing in-line.

Third draft:
Climate justice is a very difficult problem which goes to the heart of the moral justification of our economic system.  For in the matter even of pure environmentalism, there exist necessary processes of heavy industry, and where heavy industry must exist of necessity there will be lands whose value that heavy industry is reducing.  When people accept that lower quality of life by living in those areas, is it not right that society should give to them a subsidy commensurate?  There is a mechanism for that in pure capitalism, and that mechanism is that the subsidy advantaging those who use the least valuable land is that they can there find land which has the lowest price.  If every society presently conceivable will have these nadirs of quality, how else shall we allocate them?  Shall we break down every poor neighborhood and crush them with great machinery, there to clear them as so much rubble and build new parks along the edge of every industrial district?  I would do that in Simcity, but the real world is more challenging!  So people will live in these places, and whoever lives there shall be living in a known nadir within the land.  How can societies ever fairly allocate that?  Can we found communes of virtuous engineers who live within them for pure love of industry?  In a world less saintly than that, what would stop any political reallocation from becoming a popularity contest with massive bureaucratic inertia?  For all its flaws in this, the market is at least pricing in discounts.

I do understand that pure capitalism can fail the public in these matters as well.  I doubt a pure market would have banned lead additives in gasoline, and yet I believe that has been one of the great public health successes.  Good regulations can be critical to long-term development.  Those who have the least to lose are often the most sorely pressed for what little they have, and the stories told of those who have nothing left to lose hold a dread power over the multitude.  I understand that intervening to lighten the nadirs can be essential for creating a functional society, and I know also that there is a justice to the outlook that societies may be judged by how they treat the least fortunate among them.  I'm certain there already exist communities who are doing this right and activists who know what they're talking about when they argue their cause.  So then, with all of these certainties and knowledges well in hand, how are we going to establish in every city in the nation a city council willing and able to take a polydecennial outlook on city planning while accounting for the eventual impacts of zoning laws upon the airshed?  It is not only in city simulators where it is possible to separate out pollutant sources so that the necessary nadirs land right where the city is doing its best to mitigate all harms from them, but it takes a rare outlook combined with long-term consistency.  Shall we have a national groundswell that finds inspired localists in every community, or shall we hear three cheers for the new land use bureaucracy by attempting a central implementation of new policies in environmental justice?

This is the stuff of many potential careers, though I feel it cannot be the stuff of mine.  I confess to looking with trepidation and misgivings upon the source that we were given for finding comparative pollution levels.  Worse, I confess to burying live wires here; I blasted a tunnel through a small mountain of possible dramas before settling on a post that questions the subject.  Contemplating this subject intimidated me with its complexity and breadth.  In wealth and in poverty, there are so many different attitudes towards environmentalism.  I believe wholly that environmental justice can exist as a progressive concern pure in its virtue, yet to present environmental justice as something wholly, simply, and purely on the side of those who are ill-served by power in our society is not a complete perspective.  What about when people kill rare crows, because they're upset with environmentalists blocking development?  That conflict, about which I have read rumor, is over the fate of the Marianas Crow, and if it exists in truth it represents environmentalism in conflict with what is quite likely to be a relatively poor and isolate population.  Showing thus that a great breadth of disagreement can exist between people over which environmental concerns are most critical and how to go about advancing them, I felt ill-informed and intrusive just by thinking about it.  I feel like I'd need to be trying to achieve this as my degree to give it enough thought that I would feel like I could address the subject in a way that was wholly respectful to all involved.

Much better!  It is the eleventh hour indeed, but I shall be excited to post this.  Now for citations...  What is interesting here to claim as proven?

Let's see...  That reference to dead crows would have more power if I could cite it as fact rather than rumor.  The long-term public health benefits of banning leaded gasoline looks ripe for a citation at the academic level of this class's discussion board, too.
