# Envs100disc7 ClimateJustice

This starts with completing an assignment.  It talks about differential access to environmental services.  I'm working on it the day it's due, because I've found it emotionally difficult to focus on.  I want to say that I've got better things to do, but nah.  Schoolwork before independent study.  

The real problem is pettier than that.  This concept of "Environmental Justice" is frustrating to me, because I see this as an intrinsic challenge.  I learned in childhood, talking with my parents about environmentalism and economics, and studying on my own as I did endless amounts of (books were my escape from the violence of my classmates), that environmentalism is one of the (infinite) category of nth-order goods.  An nth-order good is something that people do not want until they've satisfied all of their n-1 most pressing needs.  Food and water are examples of things that are not nth-order goods; someone who is scarce of either is desperate, no matter what other conditions prevail in their life.  Environmentalism is an nth-order good, because people who are living in an ugly environment who also have other shortages will solve their other shortages first.  As India's government once (very ignorantly) said: "Nobody dies of air pollution."  So "Climate Justice" is just another way to say "we aren't as wealthy as we should be to meet everyone's needs".  The wealthier societies are better at environmentalism, because the wealthier societies have satisfied their desperations and gotten to the business of producing nth-order goods.  Part of why "you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone" is true is because humans sometimes do immense environmental damage in the process of building up enough wealth to appreciate nth-order goods.

I have to work through all this frustration.  I *know* my creative process.  I should've been started on this two days ago and complaining to my files until I'd gotten down all the thoughts I've got already.

In that spirit, I wonder if I can tie this to antinatalism.  Humanity throughout history has admired parents - and most children in most of history were abused.  Humanity started taking baby steps towards sane parenting in the 19th century and hadn't managed to fully implement its own knowledge of the subject by the conclusion of the 20th century.  Society admiring parenting greatly throughout history resulted in a lot of kids getting beaten or worse.  Society ceasing to admire parenting in the 20th century resulted in dramatically better parenting across the board.  The parent-admiring societies that brutalized kids ("for their own good") expanded to the famine limit and threw their kids into the meatgrinder against neighbors who harmed them in no way save having a similar parent-admiring society.  What does this have to do with climate justice?  Poor, highly fecund populations are the most devastating to their environment.  Societies that beat their kids into breeders desertify the landscape.  They react to wealth by whelping themselves into poverty, and so they never get wealthy enough to start satisfying nth-order goods.  That keeps societies too brutally poor to protect the environment.  Eventually it makes societies too brutally poor to live.  Several societies in history have desertified themselves to death.  A few societies have desertified themselves to a life dry and violent in the deserts; we see this in the Arab world, as the modern Middle East societies managed to survive going through this process.  We can see that the result they've achieved is a miserable but intact rape-dependent inquisitor culture.

We see that process of whelping their families into poverty in every nation of the world.  Humans breed in suffering, not wealth.  In historic times when populations were considerably lower than modern populations, what were the family sizes?  Huge.  Where do you still find huge families today?  Ghettos...  Loveless violent families who breed more than they care are really bad for the environment!  Nice gentle families who have 1.2 kids are a lot better for the environment AND more loving.  "Nobody" is allowed to point that out.  It's considered bigoted.  And it's like...  I'm referencing no categories here save the categories of love.  I don't want to say that capitalism is an awesome system for justice, because it's *not*, but the great mass of the people do their best to work for and reward those who are loving.  Love is still the light.  Loveless violent humans who breed more than they care used to be everywhere and everyone.  That *was* the society that admired parents.  That's why most humans in most historic societies *have literally beat their kids obedient*.  We stopped doing that, and... well, the result of not beating kids seems to include a lot more compassionate environmentalists living in a much more advanced economy with far fewer kids.  We now have *more* people living *better* lives while doing *less* environmental damage than our ancestors did.  It is the advancement of our ethic that enabled that.

This is one of the great taboos between the first and third world.  We maintain polite lies about the ecological footprint which put the weight of the blame on our heads as we cajole the third world to develop in sane ways that won't destroy their long-term human potentials.  I say that ecological footprint calculations are lies, but I do admit that those calculations are founded technical truths.  First worlders with currently available technology cannot indefinitely live as we live today.  That's not because we're not considerably improved from our ancestors, because we are doing MUCH better than our ancestors.  That's the 'polite lie' sense of it; I admit only technical truth, and hold still that we're doing better and lining up the technologies to do better still.  The odds look good to me that America, Europe, and Japan get to keep their standard of living indefinitely, because we've spent decades learning how to make that standard of living more sustainable.  It's the third world countries that are dooming humanity's environment.  How's that for climate justice?  We all get to suffer because humans *overseas* are still adhering to the rule that humans breed in suffering and can beat their kids into dynastic compliance.

I support universal human sterilization and a shift to artificial wombs and geneticist services for ALL reproduction.  How's that for an environmental policy?  I see it as the apex transition of the arc of progress whereby parents get respected less and children get protected more.  No more parenting; no more beating kids into obedient dynastic continuation points.  You don't have an oversoul travelling from your generation to the next.  The first day we can get away from that is the correct day to put all of that away.  There should be no more impoverished children, nor do I speak a word against the poor when I say that; for in this policy there would be no more rich children either, but all children would be given conditions protective from hazards environmental and otherwise.  That's the way of love, of moving farthest from our violent ancestors who destroyed the landscape of their nations as they destroyed the landscapes of their souls, and maximizing our ability to protect every innocence.  I believe we can protect both genetic and neurological diversity better with [[diversican cloning]] someday than we'll ever be able to with some kind of manipulative public policy.  The advocates of "diversity" in the first world opened the door to child-brutalizing foreign dynasts with no love of liberalism apparent in their priorities, and let civil rights slip though civil rights are and have always been our guardian against horrific abuses.

...I don't want to hold back development from other countries.  Far from it.  I want them to develop until they get far enough into nth-order goods to start honestly protecting the environment they live in and the vulnerable members of their populations.  The great struggle for development is that it has to *overrun* natalism.  In order for environmentalism to take root in a population, *development must first exceed natalism*.  If development never overruns natalism, humans keep breeding in suffering and dying of it.  There's a necessary acceleration which kicks humanity into seeking nth-order goods rather than breeding in desperation, and compassionate efficiency along with *everything else that makes life worth living* is an nth-order good.  This goes back to eco-industrialism for me.  There are all these societies on Earth that never got *the kick* and still exist in a sociopathic ancestral mode.  Environmentalism will fail if it can't figure out how to bootstrap development levels far enough fast enough that people start to value living in this world more than reproducing in this world.  That's climate justice as I understand it to be true, and that's climate justice as I can't present it to a university environment.

The presentation associated with the homework that is this assignment's first dependency is focused on local county policy, not world justice.  I'm actually a little miffed by the localism, too.  I'm not enthused by filling out a compulsory survey to file details of my personal life with my environmental sciences teacher.  It looks like there's something of a worksheet, and I should assemble its own document for that.  So, therefore:  [[envs100week7homework-ClimateJustice]]

I'm demoralized trying to do this assignment.  The university already has my address, I believe.  Yet I have to compile a bunch of environmental quality information about my home and publish it to the teacher.  I don't want to do that.  It's an interesting skill and I understand it as an information-acquisition exercise which I could do for future potential living environments, and yet...

It actually feels supremacist, too.  The whole exercise.  I would say the long-term reason why climate justice issues exist is because development hasn't universally overran natalism.  Yet I would say that the immediate reason why climate justice issues exist is because poor and disabled people have to live in places which have priced in discounts for bad environmental quality, and I don't foresee *myself* as ever having to live in a bad area unless I do it voluntarily.  I feel especially bad for the disabled, and not only because I myself have disabling medical conditions that provoke sympathy with that population, but because they can be forced to live in bad areas even if they aren't contributing to the long-term causes of bad areas existing.  Yet I'm rich, both globally and vs the domestic population of other disabled people.  I identify as philosophically hedonistic, but my idea of pleasure is so wholly textual that I'm essentially a wealthy ascetic.  I don't even consider myself to own things, but I'm hardly poor...  I can't use this information to help anyone, even those whose plight is worsened by woes similar to mine.  All I can do is affirm my relative advantage.  I have sufficient access to resources that I can maintain my current standard of living for the indefinite future, but...  I couldn't even *opt* for a lower standard of living.  The circumstances of my life are something of a gilded cage.  What can I do with this information but be confronted with problems against which I am helpless and the fact that people I would rather help are likely to hate me?

The area where I live is a great swathe of relative advantage, too.  Redmond is full of trees and low in traffic.  Industrialism is both well-regulated and technologically advanced in this area.  What am I supposed to do to make things better - take a trashbag out for a stroll of volunteer litter-picking?  That's a real question.  I make no regular practice of it, but I've done that before.  Growing up, I was roughly rebuked for doing that, as supposedly cleaning up places took work away from janitors and sanitation workers...  I was very confused by the sternness by which I was met for cleaning up other peoples' messes!  It seems like there's plenty of work to be done, and that work is intrinsically unpleasant enough that more hands only makes lighter work of it.  The pastor at the church encouraged me to keep cleaning up areas as I could, one of the many reasons for which I loved him.  (He was so unlike the rest of the people in the area.)  I haven't been likewise rebuked in adulthood, though a confused police officer did once stop to ask me what I was doing.  I noticed that the local government and local businesses put in more effort after I did, too.  Far from taking work away from sanitation, I felt like I was encouraging sanitation work to be considered more of a respectable necessity in my area.  <3  Yet does it amend environmental justice issues in some way?  I already live somewhere wealthy.  My area is already mostly clean, and if it weren't, it's not like I would expect to impact airborne particulate concentrations just by picking up debris.  I don't have the skills, equipment, or institutional backing to accomplish more than that.

1) The whole fitness fixation seems like it ignores the medical interventions needed to make fitness reasonable.  People already know fitness is valuable.  They're already putting as much effort as they can sustain into it.  People who hate the unfit are the primary reason the unfit exist at all; a society governed by morphological freedom perogatives instead would have neither hatred for the unfit *nor* the unfit themselves, and it would "eliminate" the unfit entirely productively by fixing their problems.  People who aren't fit when morphological freedom prevails are doing something they'd rather be doing - that's how it is *anyways*, but if changing the body was given the proper medical support infrastructure that it actually requires, observed reality would start to conform to people's expectations of what an empowered reality looks like.  It's the unproductively stoic and anti-hedonological arrangement of society which results in a society of fat miserable people and thin miserable people broken hostile to fat people for no particular reason.  Unfitness is monstrously expensive and the magical thinking of the people who are already fit isn't cutting it as a solution.  If they want to buy a world where people get thin, they have to yield up the resources needed to fix a monstrously expensive problem, because the people who *have* that problem *by definition* do not already have the resources to fix it.  Wishing, screaming, and victimizing the "noncompliant" just makes people fatter, because it very logically results in more of the public *not having the resources to fix a monstrously expensive problem*.
2) As far as park access, I don't know what I'd change.  Park access looks pretty good in my area.  This is a scientific problem, not a parkland problem.
3) I don't think the system is implemented honestly.  My immediate intuition is that the data is corrupted and being utilized in an anti-scientific manner as a way of advertising localities rather than validly sharing information about them.  I don't feel like I learned anything about my county's environmental risks.  Instead I learned that my blatantly very white area is rated as having a high density of scary hazardous black people.  Since I've seen black people about as often in this area as I saw them in the also-very-white rural area where I grew up, I assume that's a lie intended to discourage local colonization by racists who've had the strength and compassion emasculated out of them in favor of obedient racial sociopathy.  Now, I understand that racists are a violently unstable category of humanity and I get that we don't want those people in any particular area, but exploiting their fears with dishonesty feels like revictimizing some of the people who've already had their coping skills most totally victimized off of them by society.  Racists are pretty far into mental health decay, and there's got to be a more compassionate solution than lying to them about the conditions of society so that they don't trouble economically important areas.  Really though, I'm just complaining because the unexpected "that can't be right" number in the review made me disinterested in looking up the other numbers...  If the rest of it is honest, but that one measure got massaged, the visibly massaged number is still impairing comprehension of the rest of it.
4) Natural spaces are big!  Creating a society where everyone has access to natural spaces is very much like trying to create a society where everyone has access to the grounds of a mansion!  If humanity had few enough people and a sufficient amount of wealth that everyone could literally live in mansions, endless great rambling trails would form up without the faintest central subsidy or regulation.  Instead we've got a species that has often housed its most exuberantly 'familial' groups in tiny apartments.  If I thought humanity had limitless resources, I would actually complain that maybe the people who don't *want* to live with mansions worth of space dedicated to them should be supported in their right to live as they'd prefer... in which case disparities of access to natural space would simply reflect that some people would rather live in shacks made out of their family members or something.  Visualize that at your own peril.  I *do* think humanity has limited resources, and that this requires some amount of preferencing for the mansion-and-grounds preference structure as the one which is ironically easier to sustain on an Earth-accessible resource budget, but I really struggle to see this as a justice issue.  Frankly, the fact that I have four sisters points up the injustice of my own birth.  Families that big are intrinsically unhealthy and shouldn't exist.
5) Poor people don't have the resources to get through quarantine safely, they're targeted by all of society as the ones at fault for everything, and they've often had bad experiences with the systems that should be helping people, which rather than becoming a reform impetus for the services to help the destitute ends up becoming yet another proof that people are poor because they're useless ingrates who don't respect people trying to help them.  The total effect is more like "helping" than helping.  I get that I'm supposed to be talking about particulate pollution's impacts on lung health here, but I think the fact that poor people exist at the point of every spear in society is a way more significant contributor.  You'd think cutting people was a public service by how much society disrespects the poor.  Nobody is productive when they're treated like shit.  This is part of what makes rich families generationally successful (they're not treated like shit) and it's part of the basic insight which empowered unions (as long as they're really just demanding decent treatment, most of society will understand why they're being unproductive and intransigent).  How did our society just *forget* that?
6) The most productive lens here is probably economic efficiency.  The ecologically protected societies have their present productivity protected and their future productivity set on a probable positive trajectory.  Extending this to the protection of the poor in society, focusing on the productivity-enhancing potential of good conditions suggests that environmental justice can be a source of cost-effective egalitarianism.  Focusing environmental gains on the wealthy makes sense in pure market terms because those populations are the ones who are far into the nth-order curve where they start satisfying more minor concerns, yet in terms of concentrated economic reward the effort spent maintaining clean environments around the poor (who have more to gain and fewer resources with which to buy productivity enhancement) is more efficient than the effort spent to maintain clean environments around the rich (who already have advantaged productivity and who are already going about the business of buying their own further productivity enhancements).  
 

So I obviously can't post any of this directly to class.  I'd have to do a lot of study to validate my intuitions to even be comfortable with this assignment.  It looks like #6 comes nearest to an acceptable orthodox handling of the assignment and would involve the least stress generally, so that one is in.  The rest of this is four live wires and #2 where my answer is, "Eh?  This need already looks well-satisfied in my area."

Bleeeeh.  I need something to post by midnight and I'm not sure I'll have it.

I feel stressed by not understanding the obligatory acceptable perspective on this one.  It somehow blurs into the general trauma of history for me.  How can so many people have suffered so much and still produced beauty?  The environment is dominated in so many ways by overgrowth patterns that collectively correct into something vibrant, but though the result seems at so many moments beautiful, every one of those overgrowth corrections is a wall of death.  In a sapient context - as we must still dwell *within* the environment - every overgrowth correction is a wall of misery as well.
