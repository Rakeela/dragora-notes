(Commentary:  First exam coming up at the end of the week.  Not preparing a small notecard would be very pathetic.  Seen as overconfident or lazy, but I know the true word is pathetic, as I've no surplus of capacity.  Still, I should do it if I can.)

Chapter 14:  Ketones and Chiral Molecules.

Formaldehyde is the simplest aldehyde.  It is a colorless gas with a pungent odor.  An aqueous solution called formalin, which contains 40% formaldehyde, is used as a germicide and to preserve biological specimens. (The molecule is given for methanal, which is formaldehyde.  A C atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms and double-bonded to an oxygen atom.)

A carbonyl group in an aldehyde is bonded to at least one H atom.  A ketone has a carbonyl group bonded to two carbon groups.  Aldehydes and ketones contain a carbon group that consists of a C=O double bond with two groups of atoms attached to the carbon at angles of 120 degrees.
