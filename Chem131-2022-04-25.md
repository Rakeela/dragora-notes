(Commentary:  First exam coming up at the end of the week.  Not preparing a small notecard would be very pathetic.  Seen as overconfident or lazy, but I know the true word is pathetic, as I've no surplus of capacity.  Still, I should do it if I can.)

Chapter 14:  Ketones and Chiral Molecules.

Formaldehyde is the simplest aldehyde.  It is a colorless gas with a pungent odor.  An aqueous solution called formalin, which contains 40% formaldehyde, is used as a germicide and to preserve biological specimens. (The molecule is given for methanal, which is formaldehyde.  A C atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms and double-bonded to an oxygen atom.)

A carbonyl group in an aldehyde is bonded to at least one H atom.  A ketone has a carbonyl group bonded to two carbon groups.  Aldehydes and ketones contain a carbon group that consists of a C=O double bond with two groups of atoms attached to the carbon at angles of 120 degrees.

(Commentary:  Teacher specified that ketones have a trigonal planar molecular arrangement.  Unclear: did she mean that both ketones and aldehydes have a trigonal planar molecular arrangement?)

(Commentary:  Jose asked why the -H has to be drawn on the aldehyde functional group when ordinarily line-angle diagrams leave off hydrogen atoms.  The teacher specified that the -H is part of the aldehyde functional group and functional groups should be fully drawn in line-angle diagrams.)

The oxygen atom with two lone pairs of electrons is much more electronegative than the carbon atom.  The carbonyl group has a strong dipole with a partial negative charge on the oxygen and a partial positive charge on the carbon.  The polarity of the carbonyl group strongly influences the physical and chemical properties of aldehydes and ketones.

In the IUPAC system, an aldehyde is named by replacing the *e* of the corresponding alkane name with *al*.  No number is needed for the aldehyde group, because it always appears at the end of the chain.

Aldehydes with carbon chains of 1 to 4 carbons are often referred to by their common names, that use the prefix *form-* (1C), *acet-* (2C), *propion-* (3C), and *butyr-* (4C), followed by -aldehyde.  The aldehyde of benzene is named benzaldehyde.  (The molecule is given of a benzene ring attached to an aldehyde group.)

Methanal is formaldehyde.  Ethanal is acetyldehyde.  Propanal is propionaldehyde.  Butanal is butyraldehyde.

The carbonyl group in an aldehyde is always carbon 1 when naming substituents.

To name ketones using common names, the alkyl groups bonded to the carbonyl group are named as substituents.  The substituents are listed alphabetically, followed by ketone.  Acetone, another name for dimethyl ketone, has been retained by the IUPAC system.  (The example is given of propanone, aka dimethyl ketone, aka acetone.)

In the IUPAC system, the name of a ketone is obtained by replacing the *-e* in the alkane name with *-one*.  Chains with 5 carbon atoms or more are numbered from the end nearer the carbonyl group.  (The examples are given of propanone, names given previously, butanone aka ethyl methyl ketone, and 3-pentanone aka diethyl ketone.)

For cyclic ketones, the prefix *cyclo-* is used in front of the ketone name.  Any substituent located by numbering the ring starting with the carbonyl carbon as carbon 1.  Thering is numbered in the direction to give substituents the lowest possible numbers.  (The example is given of cyclopentanone with a cyclopentane and a single oxygen double-bond sticking off of it, as well as 3-methylcyclohexanone which is cyclohexane with an O double-bonded at position 1 and a methyl group attached at position 3.)

Name the longest carbon chain by replacing the *-e* in the alkane name with *-one*.  Number the carbon chain starting from the end nearer the carbonyl group and indicate its location.  Name and number any substituents on the carbon chain.

According to IUPAC rules for nomenclature, the more oxidized group will take priority in naming a compound with more than one functional group.

Priority of functional groups in IUPAC names:
1. Aldehyde.  As a substituent, formyl-.
2. Ketone.  As a substituent, oxo-.
3. Alcohol.  As a substituent, hydroxy-.
4. Alkane.  As a substituent, alkyl-.
5. Halogen.  As a substituent, halo-.

(Commentary:  I got a table copied in time!)

The functional group that is highest on the list is named as the compound, and any group lower on the list is named as a substituent.  Examples are given for naming an alcohol, a ketone, and an aldehyde.  (The examples are given of 2-Chloro-1-propanol, 4-Hydroxy-2-pentanone, and 3-oxobutanal.)

Formalin, a 40% formaldehyde aqueous solution, is used as a germicide and to preserve biological specimens.  It is also used in industry as a reactant in the synthesis of polymers used to make fabrics, insulation materials, carpenting, pressed wood products such as plywood, and plastics for kitchen counters.  Exposure to fumes can irritate the eyes, nose, and upper respiratory tract, and cause skin rashes, headaches, dizziness, and general fatigue.

The simplest ketone, known as acetone, propanone, or dimethyl ketone, is a colorless liquid with a mild odor that has wide use as a solvent in cleaning fluids, paint and nail polish removers, and rubber cement.  In the body, acetone may be produced in uncontrolled diabetes, fasting, and high-protein diets when large amounts of fats are metabolized for energy.

Several naturally occurring aromatic aldehydes are used to flavor food and as fragrances in perfumes.  Benzaldehyde is found in almonds.  Vanillin is found in vanilla beans.  Cinnemaldehyde is found in cinnamon.

14.2 Physical Properties of Aldehydes and Ketones

Aldehydes and ketones contain a polar carbonyl group with a partial negative charge on the carbonyl oxygen atom and a partial positive charge on the carbon atom.

At room temperature, methanal (formaldehyde) and ethanal (acetaldehyde) are gasses.  Aldehydes and ketones containing 3 to 10 carbon atoms are liquids.  The polar carbonyl group with a partially negative oxygen atom and a partially positive carbon atom leads to dipole-dipole interactions but doesn't allow hydrogen bonds.  The polar C=O group has an influence on the boiling points and the solubility of aldehydes and ketones in water.

Aldehydes and ketones have dipole-dipole interactions between polar groups.  They have higher boiling points than alkanes and ethers of similar mass as a result of dipole-dipole interactions.  They have lower boiling points than alcohols of similar mass because they do not form hydrogen bonds.

Boiling point table:
1.  Alkane - 58 molar mass - 0 degrees celsius
2. Propanol - 58 molar mass - 49 degrees celsius
3. Propanone - 58 molar mass - 56 degrees celsius
4. 1-Propanol - 60 molar mass - 97 degrees celsius

For aldehydes and ketones, the boiling points of both aldehydes and ketones increase as the number of carbon atoms and dispersion forces increase, raising their boiling points higher.

(Commentary:  Longer table slide followed.  I'm not likely to copy this one.)

Aldehydes and ketones with 1 to 4 carbons are soluble in water, but with 5 or more carbons are not very soluble in water.  (Commentary:  Teacher says to consider 5 or more carbons not soluble.)  They form hydrogen bonds with water between the carbonyl oxygen and hydrogen atoms of water.
