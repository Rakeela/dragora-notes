My dear Kettikita has a spot of health research advice for Earth: research e-stim/exercise combinations.  Try to modify how the heart responds to training.

No results are guaranteed.  It's just a source of hypotheses.  How does electrically controlling the heart rate affect endurance and the development of endurance?  Could the heart be trained in ways that improve outcomes for heart disease sufferers?  How about ways that improve outcomes for athletes?
