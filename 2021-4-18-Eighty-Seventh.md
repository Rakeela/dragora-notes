My dear Kettikita has a spot of health research advice for Earth: research e-stim/exercise combinations.  Try to modify how the heart responds to training.

No results are guaranteed.  It's just a source of hypotheses.  How does electrically controlling the heart rate affect endurance and the development of endurance?  Could the heart be trained in ways that improve outcomes for heart disease sufferers?  How about ways that improve outcomes for athletes?

I'm attributing this to Kettikita, because even though I can readily conceive of testable hypotheses from this concept, it's off the edge of the map that I want to explore.

A lot of fantasies skip to the objective without thinking of the 'how'.  Writing a story from an objective then involves a lot of thinking back from the objective to reconstruct the method.

Potentially nonsensical thoughts: is it possible to construct something which only probably exists, within the overlapping fields of particles whose relative position is stabilized by a crystalline structure?  What patterns can exist in the fields that surround each particle?  How are those patterns modified by interaction with nearby particles?

Related nonsensical thought:  Can machines be made of virtual particles?

Presumptively fictitious thought:  Every world is infinetismal in every other world.

I've always rarely heard music never made on Earth.  Today's music has been unusually good.  A sound like a strange drum featured, somehow both breathy and powerful.  I think it was like percussion powered by air pressure releases... but I'm not a musician, and I may have misjudged it.
