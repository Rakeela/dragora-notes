# Ischemic Tissues

Ischemia is oxygen deprivation.  Heart attacks, strokes, and pneumonia all have something in common: they kill tissues with ischemia.

There has been some promising research around the use of [[mitochondria]] to deal with ischemic injury.  Supplying exogenous mitochondria appears to reduce cardiac injury from ischemia and [[ischemia-reperfusion-injury]].
