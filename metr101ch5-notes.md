# Metr101Ch5 Notes

Getting into the right mindset to take meteorology notes has been difficult.  I'm very prey to my biases in this subject, and while my biases are atypically well-formed to the actual systems, that doesn't mean I have a complete intuitive comprehension of the weather.  I'm a little concerned that I may do well on essays and poorly on tests.  On the one hand, maybe 'good enough is good enough' given that I want to respectful and respectable to people who are good at meteorology more than I want to be a meteorological specialist myself.  It wouldn't interfere with my career planning in any way if I score a C in meteorology.  On the other hand, those well-formed biases arose because meteorology is near enough my thoughts to matter to me, so failing at correcting my thoughts is *not ideal* here.  Not to mention the general principle factor that thoughts should be corrected towards truth.

The concept of environmental stability is giving me some difficulty.  Let's see if putting my understanding into words can help.

An unstable atmosphere has a rapid lapse rate.  When the lapse rate is rapid, warm air that rises is surrounded by cold air.  Adiobiatic cooling affects the rising air, but it remains warmer than its surrounding air.  That encourages continued ascent.  The air keeps rising until its temperature equalizes.

A stable atmosphere has a gradual lapse rate.  When the lapse rate is gradual, warm air that rises is...  still surrounded by warm air?  As adiobiatic cooling affects the rising air, it stops being warmer than its surrounding air.  Rapid temperature equalization encourages horizontal mixing instead.

A conditionally stable atmosphere..?  I dunno, I'm still trying to sort this out.
