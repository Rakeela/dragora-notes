# Metr101Ch5 Notes

Getting into the right mindset to take meteorology notes has been difficult.  I'm very prey to my biases in this subject, and while my biases are atypically well-formed to the actual systems, that doesn't mean I have a complete intuitive comprehension of the weather.  I'm a little concerned that I may do well on essays and poorly on tests.  On the one hand, maybe 'good enough is good enough' given that I want to respectful and respectable to people who are good at meteorology more than I want to be a meteorological specialist myself.  It wouldn't interfere with my career planning in any way if I score a C in meteorology.  On the other hand, those well-formed biases arose because meteorology is near enough my thoughts to matter to me, so failing at correcting my thoughts is *not ideal* here.  Not to mention the general principle factor that thoughts should be corrected towards truth.

The concept of environmental stability is giving me some difficulty.  Let's see if putting my understanding into words can help.

An unstable atmosphere has a rapid lapse rate.  When the lapse rate is rapid, warm air that rises is surrounded by cold air.  Adiobiatic cooling affects the rising air, but it remains warmer than its surrounding air.  That encourages continued ascent.  The air keeps rising until its temperature equalizes.  If the adiabiatic cooling rate is wholly overcome by the environmental lapse rate, the resulting superadiabiatic environment promotes very strong rising air currents, because the air that rises and cools in that environment will be surrounded by air that is even farther from its temperature than the air it started next to, intensifying the rising tendency of the already-rising air and accelerating its upwards trajectory.  This condition is most common at ground-level; should it occur slightly farther away, the associated strong vertical turbulence typically promotes the formation of thunderstorms.

A stable atmosphere has a gradual lapse rate.  When the lapse rate is gradual, warm air that rises is...  still surrounded by warm air?  As adiobiatic cooling affects the rising air, it stops being warmer than its surrounding air.  Rapid temperature equalization encourages horizontal mixing instead of vertical ascent.  Clouds in a stable atmosphere form stratus decks.

A conditionally stable atmosphere is formed of moist, but not saturated air.  As this air rises, adiabiatic cooling eventually pushes it down to its dew point for the moisture content that it contains.  At the dew point, moist adiabiatic cooling takes over instead.  Moist adiabiatic cooling is slower than dry adiabiatic cooling, because condensation releases energy?  ~~~~  I found the section I was looking for in the text, several pages prior.  It's just bad textual organization.  That seems to be endemic this semester.

Anyways, evaporation is a cooling process, so it stands to reason that condensation is a warming process.  As the water condenses out of the rising air, it warms.  This means the moist adiabiatic cooling rate is lower than the dry adiabiatic cooling rate, because it's being partially countered by condensation energy.  If the lapse rate is between the moist and dry adiabiatic cooling rates, air that is rising at its dew point will shed water molecules and become farther from the temperature of surrounding air, thus continuing to rise until the dry and moist adiabiatic cooling rates converge at very low temperatures.

I wonder if pyrocumulus formation, or at least some kind of deliberate hotspot formation, could be used to induce rain.  Is there any way to create controllable temporary hotspots without increasing the overall energy of the system?  If hotspotting for cloud formation were a viable strategy, it could lower net temperatures through promoting the development of reflective low-level clouds.
Tying this into my precipitation-modifying naval mirror-drone concept from other notes, I wonder if this could be achieved through manipulating the surface geometry and interdrone formations in order to create the conditions for enthusiastic evaporation.  The mirror-drones are already intended to increase local albedo for temperature control purposes.  If they were also designed to heat the water in their vicinity with mild solar concentration, as through correctly shaped exteriors and arranging themselves in local formation rings, the heated water surfaces between the drones would achieve accelerated evaporation and upwards air current formation.  That would promote downwind cloud formation and cause predictable albeit only statistical increases to albedo in adjoining regions as well.  The deployment of water-heating formations could be a controllable phenemonen in that the drones could also simply not arrange themselves that way.  Evenly dispersed or maximally concentrated formations would exert a cooling effect on water surfaces by intercepting solar radiation and reflecting it upwards without local concentration.  As a planetary temperature control technique, it would be most interesting to create locally superadiabiatic conditions during periods of general atmospheric stability, thereby encouraging the formation of heat-reflecting low level stratus decks in downwind regions.  As a cooling focus, it would be most effective to adopt superadiabiatic formations on mornings when downwind regions have stable atmosphere configurations, because low level stratus decks encourage heat reflection during the day and heat retention during the night.
It's not a weather controlling technology proposal as much as it is a weather-biasing technology, but systematic biasing of cloud cover potentials could make the retention vs reflection profile something civilization could nudge.  Clouds could do either for us if only we could control when and where they form...

If you pumped coolant through the roof of an indoor pig farm, the area of effect that it pollutes with pigstink would decline significantly.  This technique could be used for any facility which tends to pollute the air quality.  Cooling the parking lot in the same way would also help, but that's so far from how parking lots are currently built that I can hardly imagine anyone implementing it.  The cool ground air promotes downdraft conditions and local pollutant retention.
Beware: this will concentrate local pollutants in the vicinity implementing it, as well as leading to erosively damp local conditions.  Implementing other pollution control measures to filter air in the vicinity may be unusually high-impact, such as by installing utility mosswall cultivations outside the cooled polluting facility.  Moss loves the damp and will filter pollutants from the air.

If a region had a prevailing wind current with a strong tendency to push air masses out over a particular large body of water, and this was stronger than the push-and-pull wind mediation effects of aquatic thermal mass, an opportunity would exist to accelerate the water cycle by building up a large earthwall - an artificial mountain range - upon the coast.  The air would dump its precipitation on the landward side, and then form a rain shadow over the water.  The warmer, dryer air over the water would then tend to accelerate evaporation in that water body.

Weather control is made of edge cases, but not impossible or incomprehensible.
