I just can't get over the fact that I was treated as getting everything I wanted by people who couldn't understand that "this is too hard and stressful" doesn't mean "I want this more than anything else in life".  I don't understand how I was misunderstood that way.  I wish I could've broken down crying more often.  People would have understood how I felt if I'd cried from the stress.

The song Iris by Goo Goo Dolls once made me cry in adolescence.  It was a song about being misunderstood, something I feared and suffered.  I heard in that the plea of my own withdrawn nature.

But it's supposed to be about sex.

Like everything else.

It is supposed to be about sex, isn't it?  "I'd give up forever to touch you," right at the start of the song.  People's true selves are supposed to be sexual.  Heaven is eternal coitus.  Knowing who someone is means knowing them sexually.  Right?

I couldn't stand that.  I couldn't stand that I had to make peace with sex.  In everything.  Nothing could be asexual.  Asexuality wasn't real.  My parents told me that.  My school teachers mocked me for finding non-sexual meanings in songs.  Meeting people online and off was something people did for sex-seeking.

The message came from everywhere, so I tried.

And I was misunderstood.  Nobody knew who I was.

This is just supposed to be flatulence and authoritarianism.  Talking too much was always authoritarianism, somehow.  I'm supposed to admit that the people who sexually abused me were the real victims all along, and not play the victim by "lying" when I was such an obvious slut that I wanted to cry about having to sexually perform.

I remember what made me cry, and I remember *why*.  I remember the tears that weren't coming to be fought, too.  I can't say I'm glad of anything right now, but I think it's good that asexuality is more acceptable in the world today than it was twenty years ago.  It's an example of good social change.

I remember in adolescence talking to people about, "What do you think we consider normal today that future generations will consider awful?"  High-pressure sexuality is a candidate for that list.

Today's been difficult generally, but in a differently-toned note, I'd kind of like to bring Lavina forward.  The challenge here is that Lavina was tied to a predestination model.  I've been thinking about how to adapt her.  She supposedly had access to precognitive insight, but she never used that in any scene.  More critically to her character concept, she believed that her faith protected her from pretty much everything, and that she therefore had no cause to fear anything in particular.  This was despite the fact that she was, like, a little *under* four feet tall, if I remember correctly.  Adult height.  Tiny ferret anthro.

I was supposed to use her sexually as well and supposedly I expressed lust through her, but none of those scenes came to fruition.  I'm glad they didn't.  The concept disturbed me; I was never able to figure out how to visualize a full-figured character at that height.  (This problem doesn't bother me as much with reptillians.)  I felt totally disallowed from expressing that uncertainty.  Small furries are just a thing!  Syra got hit by a different specific expression of the same thing; I felt obligated to be lusty with her.  I felt disallowed from expressing ALL qualms with ALL things sexual.  I just had to adapt.  I didn't like that.

Lavina was really at her best as a priestess, and some of those scenes *did* happen.  Her most memorable scene to me involved staring down a demon on the steps of a temple... and talking to it in an infernal tongue that she learned through her studies.  She was eye level with the demon... because it was standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs.

The people on FFa didn't have enough sense of... drama without hatred, of collaboratively designed narrative.  Marshe told me the only way to plan scenes with anyone was to be in their typefucking clique; relatedly, I resent him more than most of the people on FFa.

Lavina was a cool character who was wasted on FFa.  They ate her, and blamed me for eating her.  If that space had been able to value me nonsexually, I could've enjoyed Lavina more.  I don't have to consign her to the void just because she wasn't appreciated in one space; her concept should be adaptable for my [[character-gallery]].  I'm a little reluctant to add her before I've sorted out which of her faith in predestination vs her faith in faith itself are more central to her character.  I think it might be her faith in faith itself, and yet...

Lavina's faith that her own life was planned in advance fits her status as my first character on FurryFaire, because she expressed in her faith something that I myself longed for in order to roleplay fearlessly: scenes planned out in advance.  Scene-planning like that on FFa didn't happen, and, y'know, Marshe told me that the only way to plan scenes with anyone was...

The players in that place didn't understand me, they punished me for offering complaint about misunderstandings, and they considered me evil for being such as they misunderstood.  The playerbase of FFa tried to eat Lavina, and they hated me for it.  I don't hate the people who played FurryFaire.  I wish they hadn't hated me, because that hatred didn't stop them from sexually exploiting me with deceptiveness; I am speaking of an environment that treated me very much as a lying slut, yet lied to me extensively.  The spreading hatred in that place empowered something nasty and deeply authoritarian.  They got away with it, too; I'm the villain of the story!

I'm the villain of the story, supposedly revictimizing people whose trust I abused while trying to extract sexual pleasure from them.  Meanwhile, today's major activity really has been crying about sexual traumas.  Yay.  Such pleasure.

I did also complain about being disallowed to complain!  There have been a *lot* of things in my life that people didn't understand because they forbade me to speak of them.  Like part of why I was supposedly an ever-eager slut with nothing in my mind but sex *is because sex was the only not-authoritarian thing*.  Complaints were ANGER.  Anger was authoritarian.  Sex was not-anger.  Sex was not-authoritarian.  So I was to be sexual, not complain-y.  I tried!
