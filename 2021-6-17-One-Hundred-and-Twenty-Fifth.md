I just can't get over the fact that I was treated as getting everything I wanted by people who couldn't understand that "this is too hard and stressful" doesn't mean "I want this more than anything else in life".  I don't understand how I was misunderstood that way.  I wish I could've broken down crying more often.  People would have understood how I felt if I'd cried from the stress.

The song Iris by Goo Goo Dolls once made me cry in adolescence.  It was a song about being misunderstood, something I feared and suffered.  I heard in that the plea of my own withdrawn nature.

But it's supposed to be about sex.

Like everything else.

It is supposed to be about sex, isn't it?  "I'd give up forever to touch you," right at the start of the song.  People's true selves are supposed to be sexual.  Heaven is eternal coitus.  Knowing who someone is means knowing them sexually.  Right?

I couldn't stand that.  I couldn't stand that I had to make peace with sex.  In everything.  Nothing could be asexual.  Asexuality wasn't real.  My parents told me that.  My school teachers mocked me for finding non-sexual meanings in songs.  Meeting people online and off was something people did for sex-seeking.

The message came from everywhere, so I tried.

And I was misunderstood.  Nobody knew who I was.

This is just supposed to be flatulence and authoritarianism.  Talking too much was always authoritarianism, somehow.  I'm supposed to admit that the people who sexually abused me were the real victims all along, and not play the victim by "lying" when I was such an obvious slut that I wanted to cry about having to sexually perform.

I remember what made me cry, and I remember *why*.  I remember the tears that weren't coming to be fought, too.  I can't say I'm glad of anything right now, but I think it's good that asexuality is more acceptable in the world today than it was twenty years ago.  It's an example of good social change.

I remember in adolescence talking to people about, "What do you think we consider normal today that future generations will consider awful?"  High-pressure sexuality is a candidate for that list.
