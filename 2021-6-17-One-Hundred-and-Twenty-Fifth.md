I just can't get over the fact that I was treated as getting everything I wanted by people who couldn't understand that "this is too hard and stressful" doesn't mean "I want this more than anything else in life".  I don't understand how I was misunderstood that way.  I wish I could've broken down crying more often.  People would have understood how I felt if I'd cried from the stress.
