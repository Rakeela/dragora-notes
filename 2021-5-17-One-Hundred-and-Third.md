I had an idea for a Stellaris event.  Based on human history, though I can't recall enough about the IRL event to reference it right now.

Occurring at a MTTH of 420 months (35 years) after the completion of its prerequisites (some of the farming techs, plus a starbase with a greenhouse module), the following would occur:

"Early in recorded history, there was a spice crop on {homeworld} named {plant name}.  This was originally a wild plant which was gathered for its flavor.  It grew poorly in the wild, and harvests struggled to keep up with demand.  Suppliers in one nation turned it into a cash crop to exploit its value, and for some time in the historical record thereafter it is well-attested in many ancient recipes.

Unfortunately, after its production was monopolized by that single nation, it went extinct in the wild; more unfortunately, all production of it ceased during a period of crisis in the one nation that supplied it.  This event is attested in the historical record, and culinary researchers have wondered ever since what was lost.

Recently, {an innovative/a faithful/an agricultural} {citizen's iniatitive/subsidiary corporation/minor lord and {his/her} court} has produced via bioinformatic simulation and historical research a proposal for a de-extinction project to grow a variety of edible ancient world plants, one of which they believe to be the long-lost {plant name}.  They're requesting the use of the agricultural module on {starbase}, which will require dispatching a construction ship to modify it for their use."
This is frivolous.  Denied.  - End event chain.
This should be harmless.  - Spawns a 30-day construction ship project on {starbase} with a time limit of 1825 days.

After completion of the construction ship project:
"With the greenhouse remodeled to serve as a vast herb garden, the first wrinkle in the project has arisen:  The module's food output is about to drop to almost nothing.  Homogenous fields of high-density processing-ready agricultural crops have been replaced with rows of twiggy shrubberies, partially edible flower gardens, and collections of old world poisonous plants that require caution and refinement to be edible at all."
We look forward to the harvest.  - Monthly food production drops by 9 for 240 months.
Wait, don't give it ALL to them! - Monthly food production drops by 5 for 240 months.
Rent is twice the module's upkeep.  - Monthly food production drops by 9 for 240 months, monthly energy production increases by 2 for 240 months.

Seven months later:
90% chance if 'We look forward to the harvest.' or 'Rent is twice the module's upkeep.'; 60% chance if 'Wait, don't give it ALL to them!'':
"Consumers have responded enthusiastically to the opportunity to try new foods, and the historical revivalism aspect of getting to try the long-lost {plant name} for the first time has spurred major interest in the produce coming from {starbase name}."
Delicious!  - 'Ancient spices' fad for 60 months, +5% happiness.

5% chance:
"Unfortunately, the ancient world herbs are proving to be largely bitter, unappealing, and mildly toxic.  As for {plant name}, although it *is* distinctively flavored and has found a few fans, analysts reviewing the produce from {starbase name} now suspect that (contrary to lamentations in the historical record) it wasn't popular enough to keep growing.  Although a few small crops of the less awful new spices are being retained, there is no longer any sufficient justification for converting an entire agricultural module to this purpose."
Unfortunate.  - Removes monthly food production modifier, and energy modifier if rent was charged.  Produces a small yield of society research.

Otherwise (if 'We look forward to the harvest.' or 'Rent is twice the module's upkeep.'):
"The new old spices being grown on {starbase module} have faced mixed reviews, even {plant name}.  The {citizen initiative/subsidiary corporation/minor lord and {his/her} court} report that they're successfully moving produce, but consumer reviews indicate that the new herbs are just not as different from modern spices as they were hoped to be.

That said, the price of exotic spices has dropped sharply as a result of steady supplies from {starbase name}.  Food quality is up, and there are unconfirmed reports of medical advantages arising from dietary changes in the populous."
Maybe it's still worthwhile.  - 'Spice renews life.' for 120 months, +5% amenities.

Otherwise (if 'Wait, don't give it ALL to them!'):
"The new old spices being grown on {starbase module} have faced mixed reviews, even {plant name}.  The {citizen initiative/subsidiary corporation/minor lord and {his/her} court} report that they're having no trouble selling out their harvests, but consumer reviews indicate that the new herbs are just not as different from modern spices as they were hoped to be.  There's some bitterness from the operators of the project as well, who believe that the decision to cull half their fields early destroyed promising cultivars, though other observers have noted that the crops most culled were those with toxicity risks.

That said, there's a substantial income from the exotic spices being sold by {starbase name}, and the crimped supply is nowhere close to meeting demand."
Lucrative.  - Monthly energy production increases by 12 for 240 months.  End event chain.

Starting seven months after the construction project completes, but only before any 'end of the event chain' occurs, with mean time to happen of 120 months:
"The old world spices grown on {starbase name} have proven something of a medical blunder.  Long-term consumption has proven cumulative toxicity and produced a few fatalities among the most dedicated fans of the new old spices.  The popularity of the {citizen's initiative/subsidiary corporation/minor lord and {his/her} court} has dropped substantially as a result.

Maybe it was for the best that people stopped using all of these spices a long time ago."
Egh.  Cancel the project. - 'Chronic toxicity' modifier for 36 months, -5% happiness, -10% xenophile ethics attraction.  Ends all other modifiers from this event chain.  End event chain.
Cull the poisonous spices and issue reparations. - 'Chronic toxicity' modifier for 24 months, -5% happiness, -10% xenophile ethics attraction.  -250 energy credits.  No effect on other modifiers from this event chain.
Assign a scientist to study the unexpected biochemistry.  - Spawns a 120 month special project requiring a science ship on the home world.  No time limit; does not expire at end of event.
{Requires Authoritarian}  Refine the 'spices' for new poisons.  - Spawns a 30 month special project requiring a science ship on the starbase.  No time limit; does not expire at end of event.

On completion of the 'unexpected biochemistry' special project from the toxicity event:
"The dose makes the poison.  Any compound that our biologists did not expect would damage consumers must have unusual applications in cellular biology, and these are no exception.  In addition to achieving the issuance of new safe consumption guidelines for our more exotic spices, new research crops have become of interest to biochemistry."
Wonderful! - Gain Vitality Boosters research option with +10% if not already unlocked, otherwise gain next level of Cell Revitalization with +5%.

On completion of the 'new poisons' special project from the toxicity event:
"A foul poison gets spat out, but some people will accept death to eat a delicious poison, and that's more true for miserable people than comfortable ones.  We've refined some unusual bioactive molecules into poisons that we can distribute cheaply for pro-stability 'differential impacts'.  The poisons from these ancient spices are not strong enough (in palatable doses) to kill people outright, but we can get people who hate the government to take unhealthy doses as easily as by telling the public that loyal citizens don't eat them."
Wonderful! - 'Self-poisoning rebels' modifier for 60 months on all colonies, +15% governing ethics attraction, +5 emigration push.

When 'ancient spices fad' expires:
"The initial buzz around {plant name} being grown on {starbase name} has worn off, and it's become an expected minor part of {empire name}'s cuisine.  Public appreciation and experimentation hasn't entirely faded, but the response is less exuberant than it used to be.  Spice supplies are going strong and variously spiced dishes are still being widely enjoyed."
People are still enjoying this. - 'Spice renews life.' for 60 months, +5% amenities.

When 'Spice renews life' expires:
"Production of {plant name} and other renewed ancient world spices is no longer exceptional to people, and indeed is no longer uniquely done on {starbase name}, but has become a normalized minor part of the agriculture of {empire name}.  As the evidence of exceptional effects on public mood have faded, there have been calls to return the agricultural module on {starbase name} to general use.  Citing continued profitability in supply, the {citizen's initiative/subsidiary corporation/minor lord and {his/her} court} have requested continued use of the module for the other half of the original 20 year term."
We see no cause to breach our contract. - Food and energy modifiers expire after original duration.
Profit-sharing would keep this sensible for us. - Monthly energy production increases by 5 for 120 months.

120 months after 'Spice renews life' expires, or 240 months after first harvest if 'Lucrative' option was chosen:
"The lease on {starbase name}'s agricultural module' has ended, and it has been returned to the use of {empire name}.  The {citizen's initiative/subsidiary corporation/minor lord and {his/her} court} have thanked {empire name} for their generosity in permitting them to run a de-extinction experiment on ancient spices.  The crops they've brought back will be produced elsewhere in {empire name} now, but no further headline effects are expected."
Seems like there's always a new flavor to try. - End event chain.
