I used too much cannabis today.  My ex-favorite strain is a little too smooth.  It's hard to strike the balance between pain relief and focus distraction.

Psychologically, I'm realizing that I treat the disorientation from cannabis as a kind of injury.  It doesn't feel good.  It only feels better than being in pain.
