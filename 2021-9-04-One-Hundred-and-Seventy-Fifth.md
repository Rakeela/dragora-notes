When I try to refer to God in a particular mode, I often mistakenly refer to Hod.  When this error had occurred enough times that I grew curious, I looked up the meaning of 'Hod' to see if there was any such thing.

I have since begun to develop a sense of Hod.

I am not grateful.  I see the utility and importance of such, but only within the constraints of this world.  I take issue with those constraints as such.  I would not myself ever subject a soul to the constraints of this world.  I do not think doing so is ethical.

I have been further assailed too many times by people who decried a lack of discipline while having themselves no capacity of discipline with which to stop compulsively violating the rights of those who they claimed to lack discipline.  They did not model discipline, and so lived in the world where discipline is not found.

Esoterically, I should also conclude that I do not model discipline, and so live in the world where discipline is not found.  Yet by observing me illicitly and then "not-"harassing me for my lack of discipline, the people who violated my rights pretty much made me prefer death to fulfilling their desires.  They could've observed me that much licitly had they only included me in their activities and had the integrity to be honest about what they could see!  I was an exhibitionist child...

...moreover, such is the story of my experience in this world.  I did not become resistant to endeavor until I had been treated as resistant to endeavor many, many times.  I was in childhood marked by a great precocious "maturity", a longing for peace, and an earnest dedication to tasks.  Yet in that same childhood, I was hated for being lazy and violent.  My "laziness" arose from untreated health conditions.  The first disruptions to my schedule were the result of working late into the night to complete math homework.  My "violence" was likewise false.  That arose from people conspiring to attack me and to blame me for their attacks against me, fabricating a violent reputation against my will and despite my pacifism.

Whenever I'm observed by people without the integrity to admit that they observe me, I start preferring to die rather than do things that please them.  Such was the death of my exhibitionism, for it was by public sexual performances that I first realized in childhood that people would not reliably admit to having seen what they had seen.  As my privacy was eventually violated in totality, such has threatened to become the death of even something as prosaic as doing my dirty laundry.

Hod, I'm tired.
