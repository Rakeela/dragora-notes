One last naked weight:  215.3 pounds.  That won't last, as today I'll be eating a good bit of candy (starting with this Cougar Mountain peanut butter cookie), but it's a new low water mark.  I want to get under 200 eventually, and I need new pants already.  38-32 is what I expect is my current actual pants size, but I've been keeping my old pants going with belts.

...I threw out the wrapper for the Cougar Mountain peanut butter cookie before logging its calorie total.  I would rather visit the store to look at a new one (though I don't want another one this month - they're okay, but not great for being a huuuge cookie) than dig through the trash...  no, that's not true.  BRB.  Got it.  ~380 calories.

I also ate a Sun-Maid PB&J Bite, ~30 calories.  Running total: ~410 calories.
