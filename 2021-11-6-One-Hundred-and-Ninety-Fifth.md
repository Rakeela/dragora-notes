#2021-11-6-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Fifth

One last naked weight:  215.3 pounds.  That won't last, as today I'll be eating a good bit of candy (starting with this Cougar Mountain peanut butter cookie), but it's a new low water mark.  I want to get under 200 eventually, and I need new pants already.  38-32 is what I expect is my current actual pants size, but I've been keeping my old pants going with belts.

...I threw out the wrapper for the Cougar Mountain peanut butter cookie before logging its calorie total.  I would rather visit the store to look at a new one (though I don't want another one this month - they're okay, but not great for being a huuuge cookie) than dig through the trash...  no, that's not true.  BRB.  Got it.  ~380 calories.

I also ate a Sun-Maid PB&J Bite, ~30 calories.  Running total: ~410 calories.

Now I'm digging into a "Dragonfly Nutrition Bar", ~180 calories.  These are going to stack up quite a lot today.  I'm not really shame-driven, and I've quite a stash at this point.  Running total:  ~590 calories.

That said, I think I'm going to throw out some of the "Kooky" pop-tart bites before the day is done.  They're not very good, and they're not healthy at all.  None of this is, but most of it is delicious.  Why should I keep the one that isn't?  It's just a disappointment.  I'll eat another packet around lunchtime, but I plan to shave them apart and dissect them to find out which bits taste good and bad.

~210 calories, "Big Cup Peanut Brittle" Reese's.  I've been wanting this ever since I got it, even though it's technically Christmas candy that I picked up after the initial spree(s).  Running total:  ~700 calories.  Current time:  9:25 AM.    Maybe I should keep the "Kooky" pop-tart bites.  Seeing them every time I open my candy hoard up is discouraging.
