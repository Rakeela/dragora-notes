#2021-11-6-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Fifth

One last naked weight:  215.3 pounds.  That won't last, as today I'll be eating a good bit of candy (starting with this Cougar Mountain peanut butter cookie), but it's a new low water mark.  I want to get under 200 eventually, and I need new pants already.  38-32 is what I expect is my current actual pants size, but I've been keeping my old pants going with belts.
