#2021-11-6-One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Fifth

One last naked weight:  215.3 pounds.  That won't last, as today I'll be eating a good bit of candy (starting with this Cougar Mountain peanut butter cookie), but it's a new low water mark.  I want to get under 200 eventually, and I need new pants already.  38-32 is what I expect is my current actual pants size, but I've been keeping my old pants going with belts.

...I threw out the wrapper for the Cougar Mountain peanut butter cookie before logging its calorie total.  I would rather visit the store to look at a new one (though I don't want another one this month - they're okay, but not great for being a huuuge cookie) than dig through the trash...  no, that's not true.  BRB.  Got it.  ~380 calories.

I also ate a Sun-Maid PB&J Bite, ~30 calories.  Running total: ~410 calories.

Now I'm digging into a "Dragonfly Nutrition Bar", ~180 calories.  These are going to stack up quite a lot today.  I'm not really shame-driven, and I've quite a stash at this point.  Running total:  ~590 calories.

That said, I think I'm going to throw out some of the "Kooky" pop-tart bites before the day is done.  They're not very good, and they're not healthy at all.  None of this is, but most of it is delicious.  Why should I keep the one that isn't?  It's just a disappointment.  I'll eat another packet around lunchtime, but I plan to shave them apart and dissect them to find out which bits taste good and bad.

~210 calories, "Big Cup Peanut Brittle" Reese's.  I've been wanting this ever since I got it, even though it's technically Christmas candy that I picked up after the initial spree(s).  Running total:  ~700 calories.  Current time:  9:25 AM.    Maybe I should keep the "Kooky" pop-tart bites.  Seeing them every time I open my candy hoard up is discouraging.

The voices in my head encouraged me to play the game Winds of Change today, as a deeply furry visual novel.

This game is emotionally uncomfortable to me, and I wonder what it's doing with its Purity vs Corruption meters.  It pretends to be not tracking the player's decision, but as soon as I picked Fortaime in one of those Purity vs Corruption choices, I got a Fortaime trading card from Steam.  Not cool.

Today, at least, I can eat my frustrations away.  ~170 calorie per 2 Reese's "pumpkins", and I'm eating three of them.  That's ~262 calories.  Running total:  ~962 calories.

That running tally was good for a while, but I just ate a pumpkin spice caramel apple from the store.  I'm not sure how to score that.

I wonder if I'll get sick from it.  I discovered that it was moldy after I'd stripped a third of the caramel off of it... and since all the mold was in one spot on the apple, I decided to just eat around it.  It wasn't a very good apple, nonetheless; I didn't eat it to the core, because the inner flesh was pink.  Yick.

I also ate four pieces of caramel corn.  How do I score *those*?  I haven't figured out how to food-log yet.

Well, I'll eat the Peeps from my stash.  This is what today is for!  ~140 calories, running total:  Not sure.

I looked up the caramel corn.  They're 6.5 calories each.  So that's ~26 calories.

Caramel apple estimates run from 200 to 280 calories.  I'm going to estimate in the middle, and count that as ~240 calories.  Restoring the running tally with the missing 266 calories and adding in the peeps, that's ~962+~406=~1,368 calories.  Strange.  I thought these would stack up far more.

---
Oh!  I also ate a third of a fruit stick earlier.  They're fifty calories each, but discounting what landed in the trash bin, I need to add 17 calories to the count.  Running tally: ~1,385 calories.

One of the nicer voices just said that they may be a help-kit sent by someone convinced that I'm a sociopath who needs more stress to stay engaged with things.  Unfortunately, I'm not a sociopath if that's what makes sociopaths successful.  Hearing these guys constantly makes normal things too stressful to complete, like reading.  I had to relearn how to read because of this problem developing!  It's hard to get anything done when everything is monstrously stressful, and I haven't been able to finish my favorite new book recently.  This short story anthology is defeating me.

Add a Russel Stover Caramel Brownie to the list.  This tasted amazing!  ~120 calories.  Running tally:  ~1,505 calories.

Also add a Russel Stover Coconut Creme to the list.  This tasted mediocre.  ~120 calories.  Running tally:  ~1,625 calories.

I think that's all the candy I'll eat for today, so I ate that much candy.  For dinner, I had garlic noodles and a salad ordered from Gyo-kaku.  Their salads are also unusually good.

---
I ate one more thing.  An evolve pumpkin spice coconut butter cup.  It tasted bad.  ~110 calories.  Running tally:  ~1,735 calories.
