11:31.  72,912.  

12:10.  73,567.  2,194 words on the chapter.  655 words of progress.

16:58.  75,766.  2,153 words on the chapter.  2,854 words of progress.

17:34.  76,406.  2,793 words on the chapter.  3,494 words of progress.  Um...  Chapter complete, draft complete?

17:39.  My word count target is 90k, so it needs to gain about 13,594 words in the editing.

17:54.  I've done very little but read and write today.  I've clocked six hours on my treadmill, and some of the time off of my treadmill was spent walking to the library (with a book in hand) or pacing around in the kitchen and dining room (with a book in hand).

18:12.  Since I finished the draft, I have just been disconnected.  Whew, I'm floatin'.  Putting on some music, taking it easy...  still walking on my treadmill.
