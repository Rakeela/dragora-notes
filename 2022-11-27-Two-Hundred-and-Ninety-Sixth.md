#2022-11-27-Two-Hundred-and-Ninety-Sixth

I don't wanna wriiiite.  I don't know how much of this junk will even survive editing.  But I want to hit par EVERY SINGLE DAY OF NOVEMBER, so I have to keep aiming for 1,667 words.  On that note, file starting at 3,687 words.

5013 words on the file.  1,326 words of progress, 341 words to go.  This is the first point I've felt stalled, so it's flowing relatively well so far today.  I'm a bit frustrated that proximity between two characters that I wanted to be "into" each other hasn't developed.  That's a lack of skill on my part.  I'm developing the characters by the seat of my pants, even if that travels away from my plans, but ideally my plans should be solid.

5,407 words on the file.  1,720 words of progress, 53 words over quota.  Yeah, this day was easy.  The material flowed through and I finished early.

I stopped at a good point.  I'm still thinking about what happens next.
