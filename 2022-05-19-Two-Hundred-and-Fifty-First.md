I just had a thought worth recording.  If medichines are invented, and they run off of metabolic energy, they'll increase the metabolic rate of whoever has them implanted.  The resting temperature of the body will slightly increase and more resources will have to be processed, proportionately to the activity of the medichines.  I wonder if someday obesity rates will divot ever-so-slightly as people install medichines and have to use more energy.
