In an ester, the H in the carboxyl group is replaced with an alkyl group.  (The example is given of ethanoic acid, aka acetic acid, and methyl ethanoate, aka methyl acetate.  Methyl ethanoate has a methyl group past one of its O molecules.)

Esters are synthesized from the reaction of a carboxylic acid and alcohol.  They are found in fats and oils.  They're responsible for the aroma and flavor of bannas, oranges, and strawberries.

Esterification is the reaction of a carboxylic acid and alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst and heat to produce an ester.  It is the replacement of the hydrogen atom in the carboxylic acid -OH group with an alkyl group from an alcohol.  It is an equilibrium reaction; an excess of the alcohol reactant is used to shift the equilibrium in the direction of the formation of the ester product.  (The reaction is given that ethanoic acid plus methanol in an environment of heat and acidity <-> methyl ethanoate.)

For centuries, relief from pain and fever was obtained by chewing on leaves or a piece of bark from the willow tree.  By the 1800s, chemists had discovered that salicin from willow tree bark and leaves was responsible for pain relief.  However, the body converts salicin to salicylic acid, which irritates the stomach lining.  Bayer discovered that an ester form of the compound, acetylsalicylic acid, is less irritating but still effective.

In 1899, the Bayer chemical company produced an ester of salicylic acid and acetic acid less irritating to the stomach than salicylic acid.  Many people take a daily low-dose aspirin, which has been found to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.  (The reaction is given that salicylic acid + acetic acid in an environment of heat and acidity <-> acetylsalicylic acid, aka aspirin.)

Oil of wintergreen, or methyl salicylate, has a pungent, minty odor and flavor.  It is used in skin ointments because it can pass through the skin.  It acts as a counter-irritant, producing heat to soothe sore muscles.  (The reaction is given that salicylic acid + methyl alcohol in an environment of heat and acidity <-> methyl salicylate, aka oil of wintergreen.)

The name of an ester consists of two words.  The first words indicates the alkyl part from the alcohol.  The second word is the carboxylate name of the carboxylate acid.  (The example is given that ethanoic acid + methanol = methyl ethanoate.). (Commentary: The -oic ending of the acid is replaced with -ate.)

Esters have IUPAC and common names: (The examples are given of ethyl ethanoate, aka ethyl acetate, methyl propanoate, aka methyl propionate, and ethyl benzoate.)

(Commentary:  I have difficulty remember "acetate" and I find "ethanoate" much more memorable.  What is with the acet- prefix?)
