In an ester, the H in the carboxyl group is replaced with an alkyl group.  (The example is given of ethanoic acid, aka acetic acid, and methyl ethanoate, aka methyl acetate.  Methyl ethanoate has a methyl group past one of its O molecules.)

Esters are synthesized from the reaction of a carboxylic acid and alcohol.  They are found in fats and oils.  They're responsible for the aroma and flavor of bannas, oranges, and strawberries.

Esterification is the reaction of a carboxylic acid and alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst and heat to produce an ester.  It is the replacement of the hydrogen atom in the carboxylic acid -OH group with an alkyl group from an alcohol.  It is an equilibrium reaction; an excess of the alcohol reactant is used to shift the equilibrium in the direction of the formation of the ester product.  (The reaction is given that ethanoic acid plus methanol in an environment of heat and acidity <-> methyl ethanoate.)

For centuries, relief from pain and fever was obtained by chewing on leaves or a piece of bark from the willow tree.  By the 1800s, chemists had discovered that salicin from willow tree bark and leaves was responsible for pain relief.  However, the body converts salicin to salicylic acid, which irritates the stomach lining.  Bayer discovered that an ester form of the compound, acetylsalicylic acid, is less irritating but still effective.

In 1899, the Bayer chemical company produced an ester of salicylic acid and acetic acid less irritating to the stomach than salicylic acid.  Many people take a daily low-dose aspirin, which has been found to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.  (The reaction is given that salicylic acid + acetic acid in an environment of heat and acidity <-> acetylsalicylic acid, aka aspirin.)

Oil of wintergreen, or methyl salicylate, has a pungent, minty odor and flavor.  It is used in skin ointments because it can pass through the skin.  It acts as a counter-irritant, producing heat to soothe sore muscles.  (The reaction is given that salicylic acid + methyl alcohol in an environment of heat and acidity <-> methyl salicylate, aka oil of wintergreen.)

The name of an ester consists of two words.  The first words indicates the alkyl part from the alcohol.  The second word is the carboxylate name of the carboxylate acid.  (The example is given that ethanoic acid + methanol = methyl ethanoate.). (Commentary: The -oic ending of the acid is replaced with -ate.)

Esters have IUPAC and common names: (The examples are given of ethyl ethanoate, aka ethyl acetate, methyl propanoate, aka methyl propionate, and ethyl benzoate.)

(Commentary:  I have difficulty remembering "acetate" and "butyrate".  I find "ethanoate" and "butanoate" much more memorable.  What is with the "common" prefixes?)

Many of the fragrances of perfumes and flowers and the flavors of fruits are due to esters.  Smell esters are volatile, so we can smell them, and they are soluble in water, so we can taste them.  The odor of grapes is due to ethyl heptanoate.

(Commentary:  There's a slide of example esters in fruits and flavorings.  I don't think I need to record any of this, but "octyl ethanoate" stunned me.  That's in oranges.  An octyl group!)

16.4 Properties of Esters

Ethyl acetate is the solvent in fingernail polish, plastics, and lacquers.  (The example is given of ethyl acetate's formula.)

Esters have boiling points higher than those of alkanes and ethers, but lower than alcohols and carboxylic acids of similar mass.  Because ester molecules do not have hydroxyl groups, they cannot hydrogen bond to each other.  (A table is given of boiling points ranging from butane to ethanoic acid.  Butane is an alkane with 58 molar mass and 0C boiling point.  Methyl methanoate is an ester with 60 molar mass and 32C boiling point.  1-Propanol is an alcohol with 60 molar mass and 97C boiling point.  Ethanoic acid is a carboxylic acid with 60 molar mass and 118C boiling point.)

(Commentary:  Another student has contributed that alkanes->ethers->ketones is the order of the first three in increasing boiling point.)

Esters are soluble if they have 2 to 5 carbon atoms.  As the number of carbons increases from 5, their solubility in water decreases.  The partially negative oxygen of the carboxylate group form hydrogen bonds with the partially positive hydrogen atoms of water molecules.

In acid hydrolysis, an ester reacts with water to produce a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.  A water molecule provides an -OH group to convert the carbonyl group of the ester to a carboxyl group.  An acid catalyst and heat are required.  (The reaction is given that methyl ethanoate and water in an environment of heat and acidity <-> ethanoic acid and methanol.)

Aspirin that has been stored for a long time may undergo hydrolysis in the presence of water and heat.  Use line-angle formulas to write the balanced chemical equation for the acid hydrolysis of aspirin.  (A partial reaction is given for the exercise.)  The acetic acid gives the odor of vinegar to the aspirin that has hydrolyzed.

Base hydrolysis, or saponification, is the reaction of an ester with a strong base in the presence of heat.  It produces a carboxylate salt and an alcohol.  (The example is given of Ester + strong base -> carboxylate salt alcohol.)  (The reaction is given of methyl ethanoate, aka methyl acetate + sodium hydroxide in an environment of heat -> sodium ethanoate, aka sodium acetate + methanol, aka methyl alcohol.)
