13:23.  I've eaten two bars of reserve chocolate and two BYOND patties on sourdough, plus a donut and an additional slice of sourdough plain, since I woke up this morning.  I haven't wanted to do anything so far except eat.  It's been hours.  At first I thought I was exhausted.  Now I'm kinda feeling awake, and...  I'm not hungry anymore, but...  I still just want to eat.  I think I'm depressed.

13:25.  Eat and sleep.  That's all I want to do so far today.  Ever since I woke up.  This is wretched.  I got writing to do.

13:26.  I couldn't even lure myself into AI Dungeon.  Well, maybe that's not an 'even', to be honest it kinda sucks.  It's more interesting than a lot of games, but I don't play a lot of games.

15:45.  I am a brainless ooze today.  I'm eating another bar of reserve chocolate, not that I expect it to make me feel better.

19:01.  I ate another bar of reserve chocolate.  I'm just exhausting the supply.  And then I'll be back to eating donuts.  I can't stop eating.

19:02.  I have drank five energy drinks today.  I just kept drinking them.  I kept thinking, "One more.  The next one will make my thoughts come clear again."  It never worked.  I spent all day unable to think.

19:30.  There's no way that I'm well today.  There is no thought that is not effortful.  I counted to ten in my head and it was effortful.  I'm agitated, but unfocused.  I'm not consciously thinking or visualizing anything.

20:16.  I feel terrible.  I'm coughing, my face hurts, my head hurts, and my gut feels fragile.  But I'm thinking again!  I thought stressful thoughts about how I felt, and my mind eventually rebooted.

20:34.  1,771 words on the chapter.  64,808 words on the file.  Slantworld calls to me, now that I'm thinking again.

22:07.  I ate some spicy food and basically felt immediately better.  The face pain was alleviated, my thoughts clarified...  The heat has faded now though and the betterness is fading, too.  My face is starting to hurt again and my thoughts are thickening.

23:17.  65,834.  1,026 words of progress.  Chapter complete.  I think I'm going to stop here for the night.

(This part added the next day.)  7.4 miles.  1,253 kcal.  26,229 steps.  5 hours, 21 minutes, 35 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  The count is slightly inflated today as I woke up hard of thinking again the next day, and I started walking on it without restarting the timer.
