I kind of wish I could taste [[paprika]].  Not sure why I'm thinking about this right now, but...  One of the people who saw more of my story than they'll ever admit to, tried to make something of the tastelessness of paprika to me.  I wasn't ever making a moral judgment...  It's just...  a subjectivity thing.

Sometimes I wonder if other people have, like...  purely associational subjectivity.  This is a thought about p-zombies that I'm ashamed to have, but in my defense, the associational bent that I've observed in other people seems to have a pro-social function.  People who aren't me often seem to like or dislike things because their friends like or dislike them.  It makes me wonder if they have their own independent experience of those things.

I seem to have an independent experience of almost everything I experience.  I say 'almost' everything, because I *have* adopted a few preferences in the associational mode.  I'm like 5% associational, wondering what experiencing life is like for people who seem 95% associational.

Since paprika has no flavor to me, it can't turn me away by its independent qualia, nor can it lure me in.  If I knew and liked someone who loved paprika an awful lot, it would be pretty easy for me to develop an associational fondness of paprika.  If I knew and disliked someone who loved paprika that much, it would be pretty easy for me to develop an associational dislike of paprika.  The fact that paprika has no flavor and no associations for me is a testament to the fact that I've never met someone who expressed strong opinions about it.
