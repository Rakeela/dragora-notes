10:44.  10,574.  10,597. 

10:45.  I don't think a minute passed between starting and remembering to record my timepoint, especially considering the minute ticked over while I was copying in my wordcounts.

11:34.  11,438.  This isn't what I need to be working on, so I'm going to stop here now and get back to studying...  ergh...  Okay, I'm going to go buy a veggie delight, then I'll get back to studying Stone and Paintings.

13:52.  Rereading is going fine, has been going fine for a while.  I'm at 22%.

14:58.  I'm at 30%.  The task is grating on me.  I'm getting back into the story.  I don't know which factor is bigger.  I think I'm going to take a break.

16:43.  That was a long session with The Ascent.  I enjoyed it.  Your character in that game IS a full-conversion cyborg.  They aren't 'maybe' a full-conversion cyborg.  It isn't an option you have.  It's a certainty.  Most of the attire options are actually heavy augments.

16:46.  2,643 words.  Thirty.  The above timepoint at 10:44 was Kelmori's Folly.

17:38.  2,878 words.  Wow, that was a long time to not add much to the story.  I am not inspired at all right now.

21:22.  4,960.  2,317 words of progress.

21:23.  4,961.  2,318 words of progress.
