Fair warning: this post is all really about [[The-Viceroy]], but it's about characterizing my parents within its ideologies.

One of the subtler problems in my life can be summarized this way:  if my parents were characters from The Viceroy, then my mom was lower-class Commonwealth, while my dad was middle-class Panarchist.  I understand (based on my best efforts to watch back at the creeps who stalked me) that "the Commonwealth are the vvirtuous people" is supposed to be true, but when I look at the Commonwealth technology tree, I understand immediately and intuitively what those people would be like if they were the lowest, worst people on the planet.

My mom cared a lot about science and the public good, but she was filthy, corrupt, unempathetic, and convinced that everyone who substantially disagreed with her was evil.  She gave me no privacy and treated me like I'd been born a criminal.  She treated me as ungrateful for her efforts to entertain me, even though I hated spending time with her because she had no idea what I found fun and left me feeling like I always had to entertain *her*.  She was very proud of Being a Mom even though she was awful at it and once hit me for crying too much and not being soothed when she sang a lullaby for me.  She was also very proud of making food for others, something that she wasn't actually very good at, but for which she required gratitude nonetheless.

She rarely drank, but she only drank hard liquor when she did, and she was a blackout drunk.  She once punished me for stealing liquor from her, which I hadn't done.  Her evidence was that I cleaned the dust off of the bottle collection that she claimed to keep only for the looks of it.  Her letting the bottles get dusty had upset me, because they really were in very colorful and interestingly shaped bottles.  I had believed her claim that she collected the bottles for their aesthetics, and I wanted her collection to look good!  Ugh.

I've no proof she made drugs, but she admitted to stealing from the chemistry labs that employed her.  She claimed that she was doing it because they were sexist, didn't value women enough, and wouldn't pay her what she was worth.  Her friends were cops, but another thing I know is that her house smelled like a meth lab.  Her *best* friends were not cops; one was an obnoxious drunkard woman, and the other was a hoarder with a filthy house.

Oh, and she kept chickens.  So it's like, what was she good at producing?  Biologicals.  AKA food and chemicals.  Commonwealth!  Hiring ten billion cops wouldn't have caught her running a drug lab, because she *loved* cops and was 100% too safely capable of lab procedures to ever blow up a meth lab.  She's now what I imagine as the Commonwealth lower class that drives the Panarchic Ritualists and the Old Empire subcultures away from the Commonwealth.  They're trying to drive out people like my mom from their society.

So this suggests to me that Rakeela World has a Commonwealth lower class.  Now, what's the middle class?  Well, my dad was VERY certain that he was middle class.  He wasn't willing to be anything else, and he was very proud of America for being a nation where anyone could be middle class if they were determined enough.  America had a big, strong middle class... formed of WILLPOWER!  Being middle class in a nation where the middle class are defined by their strength of will was his identity.

He taught me a weird metanationalist POV that I've never found anywhere else (the gist of it is that all nations are beautiful in their own way).  Combining that with his love of military history and his private pacifism, I thought of him immediately when I read the description of the Panarchic War Memorial.  Every time that technology goes up anywhere in The Viceroy, I imagine people like my dad proliferating planetside.  I feel like he'd understand that tech even though I don't, and a society *with* that tech would understand *him*, something that I got the sense of *our* society never really managing to do.  As a kid, I felt like my dad was a misfit on Earth, and I sometimes longed for him to have a world where he fit in better.

He was a two-faced charismatic guy, and not really like the stereotypes of such people on Earth.  His 'obvious' face was a standard Evil Jackass Nationalist like nationalists are supposed to be: bitter hateful indoctrinated people without a real cause to their hostilities or a real ability to understand why they're mindlessly repeating hatreds.  That it was a cultural performance was clear to me from his private commentary praising the nationalists of pretty much every nation.  That it was an *ugly* performance is part of why I dislike nationalist indoctrination so much, and given that he taught progressivism in private I don't exactly feel like I'm betraying my lineage by rejecting nationalism.

His dedication to learning of all nations is strongly reminiscent to me of the Panarchic Ritualist's fixation on Influence technologies, which give them cumulative permanent modifiers over the course of successive administrations.  This sounds inevitably less charming, but his two-faced fixation on performing his self-defined strong-willed role for whoever was in earshot is also reminiscent to me of the Panarchy.  (He was usually a more tired, gentle man if only I was nearby.)  When I played Age of Wonders Planetfall, the Shakarn reminded me of him with their strength-and-secrecy attitude, though his commitment to protecting his friends and colleagues at least had me thinking of him as a Celestian.

So a counterfactual Planet Rakeela would have a Commonwealth lower class and a Panarchic middle class... meaning that the upper class is, by process of elimination, Imperial: serene and fixated on automated industrial development.  AKA my 'native galactic culture' would be the Old Empire.  That even fits pretty well to my own childhood interest in agricultural automation and biotechnology, though I *really* wanted to participate in developing such technology more as a politician promoting it than as a researcher.  I wanted to be a speechwriter, so I tend to see myself in the technology of the Panarchic Symposium.  I almost went into seminary school even though I didn't believe in religion at all, and in hindsight maybe I should've taken the other path down the trousers of time when I was seriously considering that back when I was 12.  The Panarchic Cathedral looks paradisic to me.  Serenity isn't the Panarchy's specialty, but I tend to imagine their religious institutions as the pinnacle of Panarchic serenity nevertheless.

It doesn't really bother me that the Empire seems to have a *sotto voce* theme of protecting and trying to economically develop imbeciles, using advanced automation to simplify jobs until they just need a living body tending them rather than anyone brilliant.  I just look at the Old Empire's worship of "Beyonders" and I'm like, haha, I'm probably one of those.  I don't like finance that much, but my dad liked it, and I liked it enough that it was another thing I thought about as a possible career.  (Unlike seminary, I do not regret turning away from finance.)  I just imagine the Beyonder Retreat as a resort that tries to appeal to people who would rather have serene recreations than exciting ones, and the bureaucratic-talent-development off the Beyonder Dwelling branch as being 'social technologies' for recruiting potential administrative talents who are content to faithfully protect people much stupider than themselves, like me.

I say the *sotto voce* theme doesn't bother me, but...  I can't put my finger on why it seems like the Empire has a tilt towards stupidity.  It just does to me.  Maybe it's because the Imperial industrial technologies seem *so* marvelous that... if you had those, the primary limiter on industrial development would no longer be the *minds* of the people, just their *patience*.  If I had all the technologies of the Empire in my pocket, I wouldn't want brilliant laborers.  I'd want button-pushers who could use powerful technologies without getting bored enough to use them dangerously.  Conversely, I would be pretty much terrified that a shift in policy might accidentally give those technologies to people who would, say, decide to replicate grenades and then make hunting goats with grenade launchers into the new national sport.
