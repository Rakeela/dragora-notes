I've updated my Nanowrimo profile with 602 words for my midnight session.  That's a minor error, it was slightly longer than that.  I'll have to update the total word count later.  I need to write ~1060 words today to hit par again.

The file I'm working on is 2,462 words.  Since I plan to keep working on it, I need to record that.

...there.  Now that I've finished the file, it's at 2,515 words.  Onto the next.

---
Next file is at 1133 words.  That should be good for today.  Finally.  Let's see...

I have 10,814 words in all, of which 4,589 words were pre-existing.  My current progress in Nanowrimo is therefore 6,225 words.  I've written an average daily word count of 2,075.

My word count for today was 602+53+1133=1,788.  That hits par, but doesn't exceed it by very much.  Maybe I'll work a bit more tonight.
