10:27.  I slept in today.  No writing yet.

11:23.  I've done a touch of editing on The Turning Wind, but mostly I've been reading on Royal Road.  I'm 52 minutes in on the day's treadmill walking and taking a break.

12:18.  I have done morning stuff, I have done reading.  Now I need to get to work.  59,035 words on the file.  0 words on the chapter.

12:21.  No wait, not work yet.  I want to pick up something for my daily meal.  I'll get to work when I get back.  I've looked up my place in the work; I'll think about what to write next while I'm out.

12:42.  Back.  Now I'll get to work.

14:03.  60,071.  1,018 words on the chapter.

14:29.  I ate a huge meal.  Massive calorie density.  This is me taking a break from my dieting, haha.  I'm eating heavily for one meal, then fasting for 24 hours.  I'll do this until the 8th, where I'll eat freely for 1 or 2 days, and then I'll resume 'proper' dieting with both time restricted and calorie restricted eating.

17:57.  61,123.  2,070 words on the chapter.  I had in mind that something absolutely horrible would happen, and now I'm reluctant to actually do it.

18:08.  61,341.  2,288.

19:00.  61,652.  2,599 words on the chapter.  I found an error in the chapter.

19:08.  61,709.  2,656 words on the chapter.

19:25.  61,790.  2,737 words on the chapter.

19:29.  61,802.  2,749 words on the chapter.  I'm tuning this, but I think I should call it complete and move on.  The word count target encouraged me to end briefly.

19:33.  The next chapter is momentous.  It's a massive, massive break from anything that happened in the first draft.  It's a chaotic engagement of the two halves of the story.  I feel intimidated and uncertain about it.

19:38.  Due to the import of the next chapter, I'm probably done adding to my word count for tonight, but that doesn't mean I've stopped working on the story.  I just can't really quantify my progress at battle-planning.

22:02.  62,612.  753 words on the chapter.  3,577 words of progress.
