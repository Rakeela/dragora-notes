#Old-Diamonil

What is now referred to as "Old Diamonil" is the original Polis Diamonil, which is canonically locked into a stasis bubble courtesy of the efforts of [[Tekazien-the-Scholar]], who intended to break the deathgrip of the game's issue-picker, and certainly didn't intend to lock her nation into a stasis bubble.  The stasis bubble was instantly fatal to all biological life in Diamonil.  Oops.  Not to worry, they've started recovering their memories after reincarnation in other worlds since.

I've still much to write about Old Diamonil, and I may eventually dredge the archive for what I've written already.
