#Chem140-2022-09-23 

The teacher is sick this week and I don't have a lot to say.  Classes have been run via Zoom.  We've been taught about metric and the scientific method.  The lessons this week have been this weak!  It's frustrating to have to attend, as I'm not learning anything from this.  At least the first homework from the class (due on Sunday) should be easy.

I'm going to catch up on my reading while the lecture is ongoing.  Calculus 1 is already a mind-stretch, but Chemistry 140 will take a while to get going.

Per the lesson, we're supposed to estimate measurements by using the last apparent digit on the measurement, plus one "best guess" digit.  If the measuring stick is marked to the centimeter, we should report to the tenth centimeter.  If the measuring stick is marked to the tenth centimeter, we should report to the hundredth centimeter.

With mass measurements, we should report as many significant figures as the measuring device reports.  The example given is that "50.830" is 5 significant figures, with the 0 included, and all 5 should be reported.
