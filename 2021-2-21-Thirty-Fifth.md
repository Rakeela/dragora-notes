From my understanding of human sexuality, there are two fundamental factors which can contribute to the rise of sexual monstrosity in a culture:
1.  People who use sex to be rude, and
2.  People who refrain from speaking about sex to be polite.

The first kind spread abusiveness and hatred *very* directly, and as rude people dream of dominating others, those who have used sex rudely have mixed the rape impulse directly with sexuality.  For rape it must be remembered is foremost a crime of *dominance*.  Rudeness is of a kind with it, though generally less severe; rudeness and rape both express the drive to dominate others and make them suffer against their will.

The sin of the second kind is less obvious, and more pernicious.  People who accept the framing that sex is rude have firstly normalized the dominance of the rape impulse as their first step in what they call virtue, and they then proceed to *quell transparency in society*.  Sexual abusers require opaque sexuality, precisely because what they do is so universally acknowledged to be awful.  Societies that are politely not talking about sex also don't talk about sexual histories, which is very much to the benefit of people who cannot survive the exposure of their sexual history.  Sexual monstrosity thus thrives in environments which accept that sex is rude and then avoid rudeness by suppressing apparent sexuality.

There exists a third way that develops society's sexual ethics without force: polite sexuality.

Sexually ethical cultures are transparent *and* polite about sex.  There is no need of harshness in preserving the truth of affection between people.  If information flows freely, people who would do horrible things can't *hide*; their peers and victims reveal them.  That revelation happens in polite sexual communities and is empowered by respecting sexuality.  It must be remembered here that information barriers are not only legal, but also social; rudeness and coldness both impair the free flow of information.

I wish I'd met more polite sexuality as an adolescent, instead of meeting an opaque and awful community that obligated me to perform sexually for them and then hated me for withdrawing.  I met people who used sex to be rude, and I met people who politely refrained from speaking about sex; those were a well of trauma.  Yet I did also meet people who exemplified polite sexuality; I still did not *like* sex, but I have no *grievance* against those, and nor did they force me to participate.

I am a pacifist, and I was very trustingly obedient.  Had all I met been honest, I would have been safe.

I found a very major error in the sexual ethics expounded in The Ethical Slut.  Page 277, on voyeurism.  "If the participants are aware of your presence, you're too close."  My problem with that is, having voyeurs of which I wasn't aware was what drove me out of exhibitionism.  I was intuitively drawn to overt expression, but I understood it reflexively as a mutual thing.  If someone isn't *in* the scene, and hasn't gotten permission from its participants, they should not *see* the scene.  Getting creeped on made me permanently unwilling to be sexually exhibitionistic... a decision that I made while still an adolescent, most of two decades ago.

It's a bad page in general.  It talks about the badness of talking in play spaces, but my own experiences were hell for myself and others to a very great extent because I couldn't find any talking connections.  I could only find sexual connections, so that's what I believed friendship to be.  I didn't like sex, so I didn't like friendship, but it was slightly better to be "friendly" (aka sexual) than alone.  I knew I felt hated every time I tried to talk about stuff that I consider exciting and cool (my adolescent fixation was economics; I was an egalitarian capitalist), but nobody was sympathetic to that (even libertarian leftism was unacceptable 'authoritarianism', and despite my libertarian politics I was pressured hard to stay obedient on threat of being considered authoritarian if I talked too much).  I had nobody else to interact with, and no safe connections in my life, so I knuckled under and put out.  I put out as much as I could, which wasn't much given how much it depressed me to have my mind devalued by sexual objectification.  That depressed low productivity deepened my isolation.

I'm not really under the illusion that I found good, safe sex-positive spaces.  I now believe that I found spaces where it wasn't really acceptable to say 'no'.  I found people and places where nobody could understand why I was constantly fading away from and evading sex-based creative collaborations.  They just decided I was erratic, devaluing me; once again seeing only sexual value, the people around me decided that I had *negligible* sexual value, and of course that was something I should feel bad about rather than an indication of unhealthy relationships.

I didn't want to be the unpaid whore.  Ethically, I'm not even against whoring, but I wasn't getting *paid*.  I couldn't see any route to get paid for the work.  My presence was being required, or else, and I had nobody willing to protect me.  Nobody believed in my value for anything but sex, and the result was that I was severely devalued.  I had gotten into that mess while wanting to be helping transhumanism; I'd been told transhumanism needed cybersexual services.  Oops.

I want to say that my husband was with me through some of that, but he actually cozied up to a swathe of the culprits, which he has never acknowledged nor apologized for, though he has consistently and quietly frayed bad connections over the years.  He has *actually* clarified to me that he does *not* believe he needs to apologize to me for telling me lies.  So... yeah, being married didn't help, he wasn't there for me, and he has overtly self-identified as someone who is not capable of standing against injustices.  I'm pretty much never going to be protected in my home life.

I got through what I went through by falling back on my fanatical pacifism, my faith in reason, and my belief in long-term trends towards justice.  Yet I wish that the "sex-positive" spaces had faced more social difficulty in telling me to shut up, because that was *why* they ended up collaboratively sexually exploiting me.  The anti-talking rules in those spaces meant that I was effectively barred by bad actors from reaching out to people who were good actors.  By personal experience, I think that sometimes people who only want to hear dirty talk are missing that someone in the room is a prostitute being trafficked.

I have not relied upon concealment

I have fought with those who have.  I fought unwilling, for it seemed I was attacked by those who shared my values; I fought with determination, for I will never yield my values.  Nor did I, nor shall I.

Syra was made for someone who made it safe to say no.  I drifted away from him because I didn't know how to "serve" him - he was a client in a place where I suffered, and what I could refuse, I wanted to refuse.  I miss him, because I recognize him in hindsight as a true sex-positive liberal.

To the extent that J_____ made it safe to say no, I did.  That's why pain barriers were so awesome in killing our sex life.  If it was safe to be in pain instead of sexy, I didn't really want to spend five hours stressing out edging myself.  I just kinda wanted to think and to hurt.  Thinking myself safe and loved, that's what I did.  Oops.

I tried to get V_____ to engage with me in other stuff than taking porn links from me.  I tried desperately, for he was my oldest friend.  I tried roleplaying games, video games, shared engineering projects, creative collaborations, spirituality, weird science...  I don't remember talking politics with him, but I probably did.  I didn't want to be his porn server feeding his egg fetish.  That sucked.  I wanted to be his friend.  Yet he only responded positively to breeder-porn, so that was clearly the mandate on how I was to serve him.

Mel was first a philosophical connection, then a political connection... but I'm getting kinda bored telling his story.  It's /known/, by now.  I wish him well.

I let go of Otter Labs when I shouldn't have.  Had I been in an environment with the right mores, I would've recognized it as something I could keep forever.  I didn't have to let that die in 2004; I could've kept it, and it would've protected me a lot.  I'm still the otterdragon, an origi-nal ottagon; I still see something in otters that I also see in dragons.

Knowing I'm part of the record is a pleasure.  Knowing I'm attested.  Knowing that people would have to /lie/ to take that away...  It suffices to me, to enforce dishonesty.  I'm here.  I've lived.  I was true to myself.  I'll keep going forever if I can.

I love my environmental sciences textbook.  I'm underusing its potential as a study text; it has a lot of comprehension-testing essay questions that I could really spend a *lot* of time on had I endless time to work on them.  I've just been fishing out enough info for passing a basic class.  Now, I do like this class, but that just means the fish are extra tasty; I'm still not putting in maximum effort.

I like putting in effort on this task.  I'm sure I could get more out of this text if I had the time, health, and proper preferred focus to work on all the essay seeds that it provides.  I don't expect to do that presently, but I look forward to keeping this textbook for a long time.  Textbooks are a better class trophy to me than my GPA; these books are advanced texts, and since you're guaranteed to have read them, they are always books you truly own.

I'll come back to work the essay examples in some unknown and possibly extensive period of time.  I do re-read books... eventually.

I wonder how exactly brain health can be defined.

At one point in the Env-Sci textbook, it talks about a 'Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)'.  I immediately wondered what that could possibly be calculating.  It says here, "To calculate GPI, we begin with conventional economic activity and add to it positive contributions not paid for with money, such as volunteer work and parenting.  We then subtract negative impacts, such as crime and pollution."  How do you measure the crime rate subtraction from conventional economic activity?  How much economic growth is worth tolerating which increases in crime?  How do you rate the contribution of parenting in one nation or another?  It's transparently false that parenting standards are a global equivalency across boundaries of time and space; we live less than two centuries subsequent to some rather catastrophically different parenting standards that by today's standard we would consider *far* less productive, and different societies have very different beliefs about what is healthy for children.  I'm not sure I understand how the GPI could be real.  Perhaps someday I'll study it in detail and find it redeeming, though currently I'm reluctant.

Note to self:  look into persistence of injury to blood-brain barrier for injuries from eosinophilic immunoresponse, for [[notes-on-potential-applicability-of-rna-vaccination-to-treatment-of-schizophrenia]], as it could be indicative of the potential or prognosis for an anti-inflammatory approach to improving mental health.

Hm, on page 147 the Env-Sci textbook talks about flood and furrow irrigation, presenting it as inefficient due to heavy water loss due to evaporation.  In my geocontroller fondness, it occurs to me that if a region were to be harmonized around the use of flood and furrow irrigation, that might result in beneficial effects on rainfall in areas that benefit from predictably biased windfall patterns from the farm.  Er, I mean, increased rainfall downwind of the farm.  This doesn't benefit the farm itself, but could promote cumulative benefit in a large farming region.  I wonder if it could be used for ecological strengthening purposes as well.  How strong of an effect on downwind precipitation could be achieved if an agricultural region deliberately tried to maximize water evaporation?

To avoid salinization, the water used for such an experiment would need quality control infrastructure, which could also be used for improving agricultural productivity among the participating farms.

Biocontrol methods strike me as contradictory to environmental desires to avoid invasive species disruptions.
