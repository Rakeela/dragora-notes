From my understanding of human sexuality, there are two fundamental factors which can contribute to the rise of sexual monstrosity in a culture:
1.  People who use sex to be rude, and
2.  People who refrain from speaking about sex to be polite.

The first kind spread abusiveness and hatred *very* directly, and as rude people dream of dominating others, those who have used sex rudely have mixed the rape impulse directly with sexuality.  For rape it must be remembered is foremost a crime of *dominance*.  Rudeness is of a kind with it, though generally less severe; rudeness and rape both express the drive to dominate others and make them suffer against their will.

The sin of the second kind is less obvious, and more pernicious.  People who accept the framing that sex is rude have firstly normalized the dominance of the rape impulse as their first step in what they call virtue, and they then proceed to *quell transparency in society*.  Sexual abusers require opaque sexuality, precisely because what they do is so universally acknowledged to be awful.  Societies that are politely not talking about sex also don't talk about sexual histories, which is very much to the benefit of people who cannot survive the exposure of their sexual history.  Sexual monstrosity thus thrives in environments which accept that sex is rude and then avoid rudeness by suppressing apparent sexuality.

There exists a third way that develops society's sexual ethics without force: polite sexuality.

Sexually ethical cultures are transparent *and* polite about sex.  There is no need of harshness in preserving the truth of affection between people.  If information flows freely, people who would do horrible things can't *hide*; their peers and victims reveal them.  That revelation happens in polite sexual communities and is empowered by respecting sexuality.  It must be remembered here that information barriers are not only legal, but also social; rudeness and coldness both impair the free flow of information.

I wish I'd met more polite sexuality as an adolescent, instead of meeting an opaque and awful community that obligated me to perform sexually for them and then hated me for withdrawing.  I met people who used sex to be rude, and I met people who politely refrained from speaking about sex; those were a well of trauma.  Yet I did also meet people who exemplified polite sexuality; I still did not *like* sex, but I have no *grievance* against those, and nor did they force me to participate.

I am a pacifist, and I was very trustingly obedient.  Had all I met been honest, I would have been safe.

I found a very major error in the sexual ethics expounded in The Ethical Slut.  Page 277, on voyeurism.  "If the participants are aware of your presence, you're too close."  My problem with that is, having voyeurs of which I wasn't aware was what drove me out of exhibitionism.  I was intuitively drawn to overt expression, but I understood it reflexively as a mutual thing.  If someone isn't *in* the scene, and hasn't gotten permission from its participants, they should not *see* the scene.  Getting creeped on made me permanently unwilling to be sexually exhibitionistic... a decision that I made while still an adolescent, most of two decades ago.

It's a bad page in general.  It talks about the badness of talking in play spaces, but my own experiences were hell for myself and others to a very great extent because I couldn't find any talking connections.  I could only find sexual connections, so that's what I believed friendship to be.  I didn't like sex, so I didn't like friendship, but it was slightly better to be "friendly" (aka sexual) than alone.  I knew I felt hated every time I tried to talk about stuff that I consider exciting and cool (my adolescent fixation was economics; I was an egalitarian capitalist), but nobody was sympathetic to that (even libertarian leftism was unacceptable 'authoritarianism', and despite my libertarian politics I was pressured hard to stay obedient on threat of being considered authoritarian if I talked too much).  I had nobody else to interact with, and no safe connections in my life, so I knuckled under and put out.  I put out as much as I could, which wasn't much given how much it depressed me to have my mind devalued by sexual objectification.  That depressed low productivity deepened my isolation.

I'm not really under the illusion that I found good, safe sex-positive spaces.  I now believe that I found spaces where it wasn't really acceptable to say 'no'.  I found people and places where nobody could understand why I was constantly fading away from and evading sex-based creative collaborations.  They just decided I was erratic, devaluing me; once again seeing only sexual value, the people around me decided that I had *negligible* sexual value, and of course that was something I should feel bad about rather than an indication of unhealthy relationships.

I didn't want to be the unpaid whore.  Ethically, I'm not even against whoring, but I wasn't getting *paid*.  I couldn't see any route to get paid for the work.  My presence was being required, or else, and I had nobody willing to protect me.  Nobody believed in my value for anything but sex, and the result was that I was severely devalued.  I had gotten into that mess while wanting to be helping transhumanism; I'd been told transhumanism needed cybersexual services.  Oops.

I want to say that my husband was with me through some of that, but he actually cozied up to a swathe of the culprits, which he has never acknowledged nor apologized for, though he has consistently and quietly frayed bad connections over the years.  He has *actually* clarified to me that he does *not* believe he needs to apologize to me for telling me lies.  So... yeah, being married didn't help, he wasn't there for me, and he has overtly self-identified as someone who is not capable of standing against injustices.  I'm pretty much never going to be protected in my home life.

I got through what I went through by falling back on my fanatical pacifism, my faith in reason, and my belief in long-term trends towards justice.  Yet I wish that the "sex-positive" spaces had faced more social difficulty in telling me to shut up, because that was *why* they ended up collaboratively sexually exploiting me.  The anti-talking rules in those spaces meant that I was effectively barred by bad actors from reaching out to people who were good actors.  By personal experience, I think that sometimes people who only want to hear dirty talk are missing that someone in the room is a prostitute being trafficked.
