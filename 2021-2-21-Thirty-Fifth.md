From my understanding of human sexuality, there are two fundamental factors which can contribute to the rise of sexual monstrosity in a culture:
1.  People who use sex to be rude, and
2.  People who refrain from speaking about sex to be polite.

The first kind spread abusiveness and hatred *very* directly, and as rude people dream of dominating others, those who have used sex rudely have mixed the rape impulse directly with sexuality.  For rape it must be remembered is foremost a crime of *dominance*.  Rudeness is of a kind with it, though generally less severe; rudeness and rape both express the drive to dominate others and make them suffer against their will.

The sin of the second kind is less obvious, and more pernicious.  People who accept the framing that sex is rude have firstly normalized the dominance of the rape impulse as their first step in what they call virtue, and they then proceed to *quell transparency in society*.  Sexual abusers require opaque sexuality, precisely because what they do is so universally acknowledged to be awful.  Societies that are politely not talking about sex also don't talk about sexual histories, which is very much to the benefit of people who cannot survive the exposure of their sexual history.  Sexual monstrosity thus thrives in environments which accept that sex is rude and then avoid rudeness by suppressing apparent sexuality.

There exists a third way that develops society's sexual ethics without force: polite sexuality.

Sexually ethical cultures are transparent *and* polite about sex.  There is no need of harshness in preserving the truth of affection between people.  If information flows freely, people who would do horrible things can't *hide*; their peers and victims reveal them.  That revelation happens in polite sexual communities and is empowered by respecting sexuality.  It must be remembered here that information barriers are not only legal, but also social; rudeness and coldness both impair the free flow of information.

I wish I'd met more polite sexuality as an adolescent, instead of meeting an opaque and awful community that obligated me to perform sexually for them and then hated me for withdrawing.  I met people who used sex to be rude, and I met people who politely refrain from speaking about sex.  Yet I did also meet people who exemplified polite sexuality, and I have no *grievance* against those.  I was a pacifist, and very trustingly obedient; had all I met been honest, I would have been safe.
