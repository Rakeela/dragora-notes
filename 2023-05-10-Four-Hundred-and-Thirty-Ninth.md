78,487 words on the file.  I'd like to say I'm jumping right in, but it's 10:15 and I've been up for nearly three hours.

79,296 words on the file.  809 words of progress.  11:37.  I've got Cassette Beasts on my mind for some reason.  I'm going to take a break and play that for a while.

13:09.  What a grindfest!  Trying to level all the cassete beasts takes fight after fight.  I don't think that helped me build up inspiration at all.  At least the game is open about its cultural sources.  It's a nice little window into folklore.

79,740 words on the file.  1,253 words of progress.  13:56.

13:59.  I'm reflecting right now that the cookie I ate this morning was magnificent.  The "decadent" line of cookies carried by the local grocery store are giant examples of what they are.  Their smores cookie is a double chocolate cookie with marshmallows embedded in it.  It's the best marshmallow-embedded cookie I've ever had.  The marshmallows are melted into the cookie as a sticky goo.

14:03.  I just tried a tequila and cola for the first time.  The tequila is fine.  The diet cola is fine.  The mixture was bad.  I drank it for the tequila, but it's surprising how much worse that was than a rum and cola.  I think of the hard liquors as similar, but I guess they aren't entirely interchangeable.

14:21.  80,044 words on the file.  1,557 words of progress.  Quota finished.

14:28.  80,052 words on the file.  1,565 words of progress.  Just tweaking things.

21:25.  I'm never getting back those hours.  Stellaris is kinda disappointing.  The current update messed up my save, but that's not the big issue.  The big issue is that it takes so long.  There was a momentary excitement when the Contingency broke open, but I took them down without letting them expand.  Now I'm just waiting to win.  Most of the galaxy is vassalized to me, the entire galaxy save two stagnant ascendancies is joined up in a single federation, and my score lead is unassailable.  I've won, but I have to wait out the clock to officially win.  I disabled all my mods to play an achievement compatible game, and now I want that Victorious achievement on my account.

I'm also bothered that one of the AIs is busted.  It's trying to do a synthetic ascendancy, but its populations are stuck assimilating.  Forever.  It has like five functioning robot populations in its entire empire and the synthetic assimilation project has been totally failing for decades.  None of the other empires seem to have attempted any ascendancy at all, which is disappointing.  They're not that complex from a player perspective.  I want the AIs to be capable of them.

21:52.  80,480 words on the file.  1,993 words of progress.  I was stressed about thinking I couldn't figure out where to pick up tomorrow, so I decided to work through something that was blocking me tonight.  Tomorrow's writing should be easier because I wrote a few hundred words more tonight.

23:11.  7.5 miles.  1,287 kcal.  26,176 steps.  5 hours, 32 minutes, and 44 seconds.  Average speed 1.3 mph.  Bedtime!
