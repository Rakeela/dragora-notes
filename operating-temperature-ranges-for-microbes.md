# Operating Temperature Ranges for Microbes

This is a subpage for [[exogenous-mitochondria]].

If the operational temperature range for microbes were adequately defined, it could be possible to predict which mitochondrial engineering projects are most feasible.  High-rate mitochondria produce greatly increased amounts of heat, which of itself can destroy cells.  If the relationship between the amount of heat produced by mitochondria and its... were clarified...  God I'm sleepy.  Zzz.  Push the microbes towards their highest operating temperature.  Maybe study how they behave at that level, rework them to tolerate it, then push their metabolic pressure higher still...  boil the world with hot algae...
