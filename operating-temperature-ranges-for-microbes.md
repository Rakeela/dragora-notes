# Operating Temperature Ranges for Microbes

This is a subpage for [[exogenous-mitochondria]].

If the operational temperature range for microbes were adequately defined, it could be possible to predict which mitochondrial engineering projects are most feasible.  High-rate mitochondria produce greatly increased amounts of heat, which of itself can destroy cells.  In order to use mitochondrial engineering to increase bioreactor output, the optimal temperature of the microbe also has to change...  or... does it?  Maybe tampering with the optimal temperature of the microbe only makes it inappropriately more survivable outside of the lab.  Would it suffice to keep my hummingbird algae bioreactor in refrigeration?
