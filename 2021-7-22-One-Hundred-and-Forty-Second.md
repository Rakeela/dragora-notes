Omelas relies on a system of perfect policing.  The child of Omelas is a boast to the entire city: good or evil, nobody can violate the system of the laws of Omelas.  The child cannot be rescued or protected.  No such offense can go uncaught.  The only way someone can ever effectively protest the city's treatment of this child is by departing it.

As in all other ways, Omelas is a paradise, so it catches all the other petty offenders.  The purse-snatchers get caught, the randomly violent people get caught, the vandals and the killers get caught.  There are no petty tyrants in Omelas.  Surely this is correct in a utilitarian sense!  They are providing more happiness for everyone this way.  Good or evil, none can violate the law of Omelas.

My first round of chive seeds have been planted.  This is just a test grow to try to overcome my total inexperience at farming.  We'll see if the seedlings sprout; if they don't, we'll see if I can learn why they didn't.  I need a certain basic level of skill in order to produce the plant mitochondria research that is my eventual objective, and I don't think I've got it on native talent.

I do feel like I just got a lesson in why religion survived throughout history.  The seeds are so small as to be immaterial themselves.  I would drop them into the rockwool, and in nearly every case I instantly lost sight of the seeds.  I just have to believe that they're there and will react appropriately to the conditions they find.

I also feel like I ought to be working a whole greenhouse.  Putting in a few seeds just doesn't feel like real work.  Maybe it's part of a path to having a real greenhouse environment?  Everloathing Agritechnologies will want that.

Will the seeds really sprout?  What about the one bit of rockwool where I accidentally dropped in three, will those plants be okay?
