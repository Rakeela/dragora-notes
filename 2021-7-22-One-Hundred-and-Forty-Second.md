Omelas relies on a system of perfect policing.  The child of Omelas is a boast to the entire city: good or evil, nobody can violate the system of the laws of Omelas.  The child cannot be rescued or protected.  No such offense can go uncaught.  The only way someone can ever effectively protest the city's treatment of this child is by departing it.

As in all other ways, Omelas is a paradise, so it catches all the other petty offenders.  The purse-snatchers get caught, the randomly violent people get caught, the vandals and the killers get caught.  There are no petty tyrants in Omelas.  Surely this is correct in a utilitarian sense!  They are providing more happiness for everyone this way.  Good or evil, none can violate the law of Omelas.
