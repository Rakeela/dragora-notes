# Vat Meat

Vat meat is edible tissue analogous to that which could be harvested from an animal, but which has been produced via control of cellular processes separated from the rest of the animal.  Vat meat evades the question of the ethics of meat consumption (even cannibalism) quite entirely, since it was never linked to any sensorimotor complex and therefore cannot suffer.

This is a subset technology of [[ontogenic-control]], and it is within the [[transhumanist]] category.
