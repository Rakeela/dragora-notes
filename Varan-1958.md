#Varan-1958

Date First Watched:  2022-08-21
Dates Rewatched:  Never

Supposedly, this movie was butchered in the American version, so it can only be really watched in the original Japanese.

It's kinda nice to get back to a black and white movie.

The humans pestered this monster until it lashed out, and then they attacked it a whole bunch.  WTF.  They could've left it be in its lake.  It would've just stayed there.  Why all the military response?  I hate the humans in this movie.  They're too militant and they should've been peaceful.

I got bored watching ineffectual military actions.

I really like Varan's design, except for the implausibly small wingflaps.  No creature could fly on those.
