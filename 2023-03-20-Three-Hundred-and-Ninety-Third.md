Morning weigh-in:  249.0 pounds

I can't get Kistaro to understand the importance of extending my diet through the weekend.

I was struggling to clean the screen on my treadmill display when I accidentally double-clicked the button.  So for my first session of walking, I took 9,561 steps, burning an estimated 470 kcal, crossing 3.0 miles, and taking 1 hour, 47 minutes, and 50 seconds.  I walked at an average pace of 1.7 mph.

After an additional 3 hours and 29 minutes of walking, I got beset by a depressive sensation.  This foul mood was marked by a strong desire to rest.

I pushed myself for a short stretch of 4 mph jogging.  That's really hard!  I sweat a ton doing it.

I wonder if calories-in/calories-out ideas encourage people to lose weight by making them exercise more, and more exercise makes them resent eating.  I wonder this, but I know it to be false.  Compensatory hyperphagy actually sets in when people exercise more.

11.8 miles, 1,611 kcal, 30,000 steps, 4 hours, 27 minutes, and 22 seconds.  Average speed 2.6 mph.  Added to the previous tally that's 14.8 miles, 2,081 kcal, 39,561 steps, and 6 hours, 15 minutes, and 12 seconds.
