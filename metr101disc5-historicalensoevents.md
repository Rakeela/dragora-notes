# Metr101disc5 HistoricalENSOevents

I'm unhappy about this assignment, because I'm starting it the day after it was due.  Still, the subject itself is interesting, in an Aleicree's-my-favorite kind of way, so I'd still like to do the work.

The assignment is to study strong ENSO events and their global impacts.  The following five years are given as examples of strong El Niño or strong La Niña oscillations:
1. 2014-2016 (El Niño)
2. 1997-1998 (El Niño)
3. 1982-1983 (El Niño)
4. 2010-2011 (La Niña)
5. 1998-2000 (La Niña)

The assignment is to prepare brief answers for each of these:
    * What event did you choose?
    * What was the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) number (-3 to 3) for DJF of the last year of the event?
    * What were two global impacts (such as on economies, livelihoods, crops, or cyclones)?
    * How might predicting ENSO events be important in the future in terms of economic, social, and/or environmental impacts?

Source policy does not require full academic citations for this, but does requiring including links to any sources utilized.  Copy-and-paste engagement with websites is forbidden for this assignment.  Directions complete.

I picked the '07-'98 El Niño event.  The 1998 DJF value was 2.2, suggesting strong warming.  The oscillation pattern on this looks surprisingly chaotic.  A quick web search for "1998 el nino effects" (sans quotes) turned up an interesting source for this (Care.  (1998, June 28)  El Niño in 1997-1998: Impacts and CARE's Response.  Retrieved 2/5/2021 from https://reliefweb.int/report/world/el-ni%C3%B1o-1997-1998-impacts-and-cares-response).  This looks like it might be a wholly sufficient source itself.
