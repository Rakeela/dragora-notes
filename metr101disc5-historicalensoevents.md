# Metr101disc5 HistoricalENSOevents

I'm unhappy about this assignment, because I'm starting it the day after it was due.  Still, the subject itself is interesting, in an Aleicree's-my-favorite kind of way, so I'd still like to do the work.

The assignment is to study strong ENSO events and their global impacts.  The following five years are given as examples of strong El Niño or strong La Niña oscillations:
1. 2014-2016 (El Niño)
2. 1997-1998 (El Niño)
3. 1982-1983 (El Niño)
4. 2010-2011 (La Niña)
5. 1998-2000 (La Niña)

The assignment is to prepare brief answers for each of these:
    * What event did you choose?
    * What was the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) number (-3 to 3) for DJF of the last year of the event?
    * What were two global impacts (such as on economies, livelihoods, crops, or cyclones)?
    * How might predicting ENSO events be important in the future in terms of economic, social, and/or environmental impacts?

Source policy does not require full academic citations for this, but does requiring including links to any sources utilized.  Copy-and-paste engagement with websites is forbidden for this assignment.  Directions complete.

I picked the '07-'98 El Niño event.  The 1998 DJF value was 2.2, suggesting strong warming.  The oscillation pattern on this looks surprisingly chaotic.  A quick web search for "1998 el nino effects" (sans quotes) turned up an interesting source for this (Care.  (1998, June 28)  El Niño in 1997-1998: Impacts and CARE's Response.  Retrieved 2/5/2021 from https://reliefweb.int/report/world/el-ni%C3%B1o-1997-1998-impacts-and-cares-response).  This looks like it might be a wholly sufficient source itself.

This focuses entirely on negative effects.  I'm a little confused by that, to be honest.  Shouldn't weather at this scale be a natural ambivalence?  I did a web search for "does el nino do anything good?" (sans quotes) to see if there were any reports of positive effects.  Instead I've happened upon discussions of coral bleaching.  Sheesh...  Are we going to lose all the sea coral at the next El Niño?  If only we had some kind of scheme to interfere with solar radiation absorption at sea, hah!  Ah, but alas I do not rule the world...  I wonder if there's any biome that could grow both coral and mangroves.  The mangroves might shade the coral, if so.  Perhaps some other kind of coral symbiote plant could be engineered?  I'd rather we not lose all the coral reefs on Earth in the intersection between global warming and normal temperature fluctuations.  Not only are they kind of pretty, their skeletons are pure sunk carbon.  Anyways, the link with the info about coral bleachins is here: (Thompson, D.  (2016, Mar 2)  El Niño: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  *Weather from WeatherOps*  Retrieved 2/5/2021 from https://blog.weatherops.com/el-nino-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly).


Chasing this lead with a search for "was there a coral reef die-off in 1998" (sans quotes), I found this: (Aronson, RB.  Precht, WF.  Toscano, MA.  Koltes, KH.  (2002, Jun 1)  The 1998 bleaching event and its aftermath on a coral reef in Belize.  *Marine Biology*.  Retrieved 2/5/21 from http://www2.cedarcrest.edu/academic/bio/jcigliano/MFEC/Bleaching_1998.pdf).  This claims that the strong El Niño of 1998 causing the first mass coral mortality in the central lagoon of the Belizean barrier reef for the last 3,000 years.

I'm really feeling that coral symbiont idea here.  I think I've found my subject of discussion - I can probably only slot a sentence for a blue sky coral symbiont proposal, but just focusing on coral is likely to be unusual.  It might get people to fear a coming El Niño oscillation, heh.  In the nearer term than coral symbionts, I wonder if we could spread reflective tarping over sensitive coral during hot days.

I wish I weren't in pain.  I already took naproxen, and pain is still distracting me from my studies.

I haven't come up with a way that predicting ENSO events might be important.  I could continue focusing on coral.  I think that coral-coral-coral attitude is pretty good here, because I think that specializing the essay is more likely to produce novel thought than drifting back generalist on the last question.  If society does come up with some kind of protection program for coral, knowing the likelihood of an ENSO oscillation could make sure that protection system is ready in the right places at the right times.


...I think I'll go with that.  I have sufficient sourcing for it already.  My next segment will be the draft space, but although I do intend to finish this today, for some reason I'm nervous about my next quiz in environmental science  I want to take a break from this task to spend a while studying.

First draft:

In 1998 for the DJF period, the Oceanic Nino Index was 2.2, which attests to a strong positive El Niño fluctuation, as this measure goes to +3 at most.  This corresponds to a 73% of the highest measurable score on the Oceanic Nino Index.

Looking up global impacts from El Niño, I found many complaints about fluctuations in precipitation causing droughts in some places and flooding in others.  Northern Africa was afflicted by flooding which was believed to be related to El Niño, resulting in widespread damage to agriculture and infrastructure as well as increases in disease rates.  A predicted drought in South Africa never materialized, yet predictions of it were taken seriously, leading to changes in which crops were planted in the region and an increased interest in water conservation.

A third effect upon which I would most like to focus (as I believe it may be timely for the upcoming probable shift to a new El Niño period) is the possibility of coral bleaching.  The 1998 El Niño coral bleaching was the first mass coral death in 3,000 years within the Belizean barrier reef's central lagoon.  The warmed waters of El Niño intensify stresses to coral in the warmed areas, potentially costing humanity a source of both beauty and carbon sinkage (as the accumulation of coral upon the seafloor amounts to sealing carbon dioxide away in stone).  

El Niño predictions provide information about upcoming temperature and precipitation patterns.  This can be utilized to adjust economic policy in a preparative fashion.  Continuing my concern for coral, I think it could also be used to forecast coral hazard levels in coming seasons.  I believe humanity should construct new methods of preserving conditions for the health of coral reefs.  In my high-tech fantasies, this involves symbiont plants engineered to spread their leaves wide across the water when water temperatures have risen beyond what is healthy for coral, shading the vulnerable coral from temperatures they can't survive.  In a proposal for something that might be practical in the current year, I wonder if local and regional governments could send people out with reflective tarps on predicted hot days so that the water doesn't heat up enough to kill the immobile coral.

I'm not going to work too hard on trying to perfect this one.  I'm just going to post it in this form.
