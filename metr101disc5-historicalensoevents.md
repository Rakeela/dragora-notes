# Metr101disc5 HistoricalENSOevents

I'm unhappy about this assignment, because I'm starting it the day after it was due.  Still, the subject itself is interesting, in an Aleicree's-my-favorite kind of way, so I'd still like to do the work.

The assignment is to study strong ENSO events and their global impacts.  The following five years are given as examples of strong El Niño or strong La Niña oscillations:
1. 2014-2016 (El Niño)
2. 1997-1998 (El Niño)
3. 1982-1983 (El Niño)
4. 2010-2011 (La Niña)
5. 1998-2000 (La Niña)

The assignment is to prepare brief answers for each of these:
    * What event did you choose?
    * What was the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) number (-3 to 3) for DJF of the last year of the event?
    * What were two global impacts (such as on economies, livelihoods, crops, or cyclones)?
    * How might predicting ENSO events be important in the future in terms of economic, social, and/or environmental impacts?

Source policy does not require full academic citations for this, but does requiring including links to any sources utilized.  Copy-and-paste engagement with websites is forbidden for this assignment.  Directions complete.

I picked the '07-'98 El Niño event.  The 1998 DJF value was 2.2, suggesting strong warming.  The oscillation pattern on this looks surprisingly chaotic.  A quick web search for "1998 el nino effects" (sans quotes) turned up an interesting source for this (Care.  (1998, June 28)  El Niño in 1997-1998: Impacts and CARE's Response.  Retrieved 2/5/2021 from https://reliefweb.int/report/world/el-ni%C3%B1o-1997-1998-impacts-and-cares-response).  This looks like it might be a wholly sufficient source itself.

This focuses entirely on negative effects.  I'm a little confused by that, to be honest.  Shouldn't weather at this scale be a natural ambivalence?  I did a web search for "does el nino do anything good?" (sans quotes) to see if there were any reports of positive effects.  Instead I've happened upon discussions of coral bleaching.  Sheesh...  Are we going to lose all the sea coral at the next El Niño?  If only we had some kind of scheme to interfere with solar radiation absorption at sea, hah!  Ah, but alas I do not rule the world...  I wonder if there's any biome that could grow both coral and mangroves.  The mangroves might shade the coral, if so.  Perhaps some other kind of coral symbiote plant could be engineered?  I'd rather we not lose all the coral reefs on Earth in the intersection between global warming and normal temperature fluctuations.  Not only are they kind of pretty, their skeletons are pure sunk carbon.  Anyways, the link with the info about coral bleachins is here: (Thompson, D.  (2016, Mar 2)  El Niño: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  *Weather from WeatherOps*  Retrieved 2/5/2021 from https://blog.weatherops.com/el-nino-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly).


Chasing this lead with a search for "was there a coral reef die-off in 1998" (sans quotes), I found this: (Aronson, RB.  Precht, WF.  Toscano, MA.  Koltes, KH.  (2002, Jun 1)  The 1998 bleaching event and its aftermath on a coral reef in Belize.  *Maringe Biology*.  Retrieved 2/5/21 from http://www2.cedarcrest.edu/academic/bio/jcigliano/MFEC/Bleaching_1998.pdf).  This claims that the strong El Niño of 1998 causing the first mass coral mortality in the central lagoon of the Belizean barrier reef for the last 3,000 years.

I'm really feeling that coral symbiont idea here.  I think I've found my subject of discussion - I can probably only slot a sentence for a blue sky coral symbiont proposal, but just focusing on coral is likely to be unusual.  It might get people to fear a coming El Niño oscillation, heh.  In the nearer term than coral symbionts, I wonder if we could spread reflective tarping over sensitive coral during hot days.

I wish I weren't in pain.  I already took naproxen, and pain is still distracting me from my studies.

I haven't come up with a way that predicting ENSO events might be important.  I could continue focusing on coral.  I think that coral-coral-coral attitude is pretty good here, because I think that specializing the essay is more likely to produce novel thought than drifting back generalist on the last question.  If society does come up with some kind of protection program for coral, knowing the likelihood of an ENSO oscillation could make sure that protection system is ready in the right places at the right times.


...I think I'll go with that.  I have sufficient sourcing for it already.  My next segment will be the draft space, but although I do intend to finish this today, for some reason I'm nervous about my next quiz in this class.  I want to take a break from this task to spend a while studying.
