8 AM and I'm taking painkillers.  2 tylenol, 2 naproxen.  This stuff feels like poison.  I wonder if it affects the longevity of my organs.

9 AM and I can't get comfortable.  My neck hurts, my elbows hurt.  My back is just... uncomfortable.  My arms, too.  And my face.  There's nothing I can do about it.  I want to lay down and try to sleep away the discomfort.  I want to eat something carbohydrate-laden.  Everything else tastes bad.  I need to be working on my writing, but I can't bring myself to do it.

11:20 AM.  Still no writing.  I'm depressed and hungry.  I guess today isn't working out so far.  I think I've eaten as much as I permissibly can.  I guess I could eat some more cheese.  Cheese is unlimited on this diet.  Bleh though.  It tastes musty on its own.  Even cheeses that aren't moldy taste a bit musty.  I just ate a spoonful of mascarpone and it. tastes. musty!  Bleh!  Bleeeeeeh waaa!

11:30 AM.  I weighed myself.  My weight has gone down for three days in a row.  I have keto bread, so last night's dinner was a grilled cheese sandwich.  It tasted pretty good.  Cheese doesn't need a lot of help to become edible, but it needs help.  I ate a whole avocado this morning.  It didn't taste very good... for an avocado.  Oh my god avocado is pretty good at base and waaaaaay better than cheese.  I also ate a slice of keto bread with sugar free sunflower seed butter on it.  That didn't taste very good either... for sunflower seed butter.  Oh my god sunflower seed butter is pretty good, too.  Everything is better than cheese.  But I really want a cookie and I can't. Have.  That.  I have keto candies.  Kistaro said to eat the keto candies at one per month, but that's ridiculous.  They're the nearest thing I have to a totally palatable food.

11:35 AM.  I've dragged out my treadmill.  This should help get my metabolism up.  I'm not eating a keto candy right now.

I read up about non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recently.  If I understand correctly, it's the result of the liver continuing lipogenesis while the body is not using the fat it produces.  Diets that increase the proportion of the metabolism using fatty acids should therefore reduce NAFLD.  Not that I have NAFLD, but I'm at risk of eventually developing it.

Something to remind myself of is that although relative metabolism slows down with increasing weight, absolute metabolism still increases.  I was also one day more dedicated this week.  I started avoiding carbs on Sunday instead of on Monday.  This is day 3, not day 2.

8:35 PM.  I feel flattened (exhausted).  I've been unable to keep writing.  My head just feels totally empty and vapid.

9 PM.  I ate a brownie to give myself energy to think with... and it worked!  That empty-headed sensation had been making me groan with discomfort, and it faded away once I ate something sweet.

9:50 PM.  I'm still feeling rejuvenated from a single brownie.  I think I may have been suffering from "keto flu" today.  That means I have to push back into it and push right through it.  Weekend breaks are likely to rebuild my glycogen reserves too much; I think I should avoid them.

10:25 PM.  The 15g of sugar in the brownie shouldn't be too bad.  Some people pursue "low carb diets" that still call for more carbs than I ate today.
