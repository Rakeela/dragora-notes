8:56.  Starting off today with my two soft tops.  I'd eat one now and one later when I get hungry, but I kinda want later hunger to push through to ketosis, so I'm just eating both now.

10:19.  No writing yet.  Just recording that I also ate (just now) a "Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Brookie".  The saltiness is actually rather appealing.  It's different.

10:34.  One of the paragraphs in Kura and Kaire bugs me.  It tells an important worldbuilding detail, but showing would be more effective.  It's located in a spot where expanding the story to show the detail would be troublesome, requiring more extensive rewrites.  I think I can do a little better nonetheless.

10:36.  21,269.  1,268 words on the chapter.  

11:07.  21,552.  1,553 words on the chapter.  283 words of progress.

11:16.  21,619.  1,552 words on the chapter.  350 words of progress.  I added a missing gryphonism to an earlier chapter.

12:11.  21,975.  1,894 words on the chapter.  706 words of progress.  My brevity limits keep stressing me.  I feel like there's an infinite amount of story to write and I have to compact it!

12:15.  I stopped briefly to read a few more pages of The Wearle.  Grah!

13:05.  22,661.  2,580 on the chapter.  1,392 words of progress.  Hah, that's very nearly 'quota', but of course the quota is a minimum and definitely not an objective.  I'm a little disappointed that I have just about run out of chapter.  I have to bring it to a close within 420 words.

13:21.  22,861.  2,780 on the chapter.  1,592 words of progress.  I'm chewing on the conclusion of the chapter still.  220 words remain in the limit.

13:42.  23,076.  2,995 on the chapter.  1,807 words of progress.  Chapter complete!

14:47.  I got distracted watching Kistaro play a video game.  Tears of the Kingdom.  Zie's doing the water temple.

14:49.  I want food, but I have no justification for it.  The acquisition of the soft top cookies fills out my basic planned eating for the next five days, so I can't even buy something for tomorrow.

18:41.  Okay, I have spent too long sitting on my butt watching Kistaro play a video game.

19:12.  23,044.  0 words on the chapter.  1,775 words of progress.  I trimmed chapter 6 a bit while rereading it to prepare for writing chapter 8.

20:25.  It has been pointed out to me that one of my characters is super-questionable.  I think I'm leaving that in.  I'll explore the point in the next chapter.  I think I'll know what I was referring to if I reread this log later...

20:28.  23,056.  1,787 words of progress.  Not a huge amount of productivity, but kind of an important day in terms of the evolution of the story.

21:29.  I have been drinking "Major Melon" Mountain Dew lately.  I am not a fan.  However, I can definitely say that the best can in the pack is the one I'm drinking right now.  Things taste better when I consume them after sundown.

22:28.  Bad night.  Bugger my diet, I'm just going to eat cookies.
