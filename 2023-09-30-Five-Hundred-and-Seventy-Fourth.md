18:55.  I have been empty-headed and tired all day long.  I've thought of lots of stuff, but nothing productive.  Nothing even very sociable.  I guess I made a little progress on my latest book?  But wow, I ought to be devouring books if I'm to make something of that.

18:57.  Anyway.  I have ideas.  They probably suck, but I have them, so I should at least try to make quota.

19:02.  57,274.

19:49.  3,243 words on the chapter.  58,141 words on the file.  867 words of progress.

20:38.  I got distracted with stuff I usually do in the morning.  Maybe I would've been more productive today if I'd done my usual morning stuff in the morning.  58,159.

20:42.  58,287.  Chapter complete.  I am not sure if I am able to write any more tonight.
