11:32.  Writing isn't a priority today.

13:09.  Let's look at my writing, nonetheless.

13:31.  Whoops.  Forgot to record my starting word count.  23,056.  23,559.  Wait.  This can't be right.  I've only written like a hundred words.  My word counts are messed up!

13:35.  All of my chapter word counts look good.  I must have done more writing yesterday than I recorded.  Yes, I believe that's right.  I started in on chapter 9, but failed to record doing so in my daily logging.  I'm 508 words into chapter 9.  Do I credit that to today's work, or do I modify yesterday's tally?  I think modifying yesterday's tally is more appropriate...

13:39.  Yesterday's concluding word count was 23,469.  That means I actually wrote 2,200 words yesterday.

13:40.  23,559.  90 words of progress.

14:07.  23,828.  359 words of progress.  I added to one of my earlier chapters, and now I have a conundrum.  It's a little over 3k words now.

14:13.  I trimmed the troubling chapter to exactly 3,000 words.  I'm going to credit myself with 3k words of editing today.  23,799.  330 words of progress.

14:41.  23,807.  338.  I got stuck.  I'm introducing a new character and totally blanking out.  I need to characterize the kobolds more, so I'm introducing another character to represent the mine better... and I got nothing.

15:10.  23,926.  675 words on the chapter.  457 words of progress.  I'm not sure I'll make quota today.  I don't have any great ideas for this chapter.  I want to be writing Kaire.  Sometimes I find that I want to be writing Kura when I'm writing Kaire, and vice versa... this is one of those times.

19:21.  I have been taking a day off from fluid intake.  I don't feel too bad, but the sheer tiredness surprised me.  That may be because this is also perforce a day off from caffeine.

19:52.  One thing that shocks me about abandoning fluid intake is the sheer boredom.  I really realize the extent to which I was drinking fluids out of boredom.

20:05.  24,065.  814 words on the chapter.  596 words of progress.  Argh, I want to be done with this Kura chapter.

20:57.  24,508.  1,257 words on the chapter.  1,039 words of progress.  Maybe I'll make quota today after all.

21:42.  24,540.  1,289 words on the chapter.  1,071 words of progress.  Ugh.  I'm starting to get sleepy.  I don't think I'll hit quota today.
