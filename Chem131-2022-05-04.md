15.4 Chemical Properties of Monosaccharides

Sugar alcoholes such as D-sorbitol, d-xylitol from d-xylose, and d-mannitol from d-mannose are used as sweeteners in many sugar-free products such as diet drinks and sugarless gum as well as products for people with diabetes.  (The examples is given of D-glucose hydrogenating to...  Not finished in time.)

Monosaccharides, found mostly as cyclic forms in solution, have small amounts of the open-chain form present that can undergo reactions.  They have an aldehyde group with an adjacent hydroxyl that can be oxidized to carboxylic acid by an oxidizing agent such as Benedict's solution.  (The example is given of D-glucose oxidizing to D-gluconic acid)

Sugar acids (carboxylic acids) are produced from the oxidation of the sugar aldehyde as CU^2+ (from Benedict's solution) is reduced into CU+.  (The example is given of D-Glucose oxidizing to D-Gluconic acid.)

A carbohydrate (in its open-chain form) that can reduce another substance is called a reducing sugar.  Reducing sugars include the monosaccharides glucose, galactose, and fructose.  Benedict's reagent gives a brick-red precipitate with reducing sugars.  (The example is given of D-Glucose oxidizing to D-Glucose acid with the reactant 2CU^2+ and also producing CU2O as a product.)

Fructose, a ketohexose, contains a ketone group, which usually cannot be oxidized.  It can be oxidized in a basic Benedict's solution when a rearrangement occurs between the ketone group on C2 and the hydroxyl group on C1.  It is then converted to glucose, which has an aldehyde group with an adjacent hydroxyl that can be oxidized.  (The example is given of a rearrangement between D-Fructose here labeled ketose and D-Glucose here labeled aldose.)

The reduction of the carbonyl group in monosaccharides converts an aldehyde group to alcohol producing sugar alcohols, which are also called alditols.  (The example is given of D-Glucose reducing in the presence of a Pt catalyst into D-Glucitol, which replaces the HC=O aldehyde at the top of glucose with another CH2OH group.)

The sugar alcohols are named by replacing the ose ending of the monosaccharide with itol.  They include D-sorbitol, d-xylitol from d-xylose, and d-mannitol from d-mannose.  (The image is given of a sugar-free gum.)

15.5 Disaccharides

Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk and milk products.  It contains the monosaccharides galactose and glucose.

A disaccharide consists of two monosaccharides linked together.  It is formed when two monosaccharides combine in a dehydration reaction.
 * Monosaccharides Glucose + Glucose = Disaccharide Maltose
 * Glucose + Galactose = Lactose
 * Glucose + Fructose = Sucrose
The most common disaccharides are maltose, lactose, and sucrose.

Maltose is a disaccharide also known as malt sugar.  It is composed of two d-glucose molecules.  It is obtained from the hydrolysis of starch.  It's used in cereals, candies, and brewing.  It can be found in both the alpha and beta forms.

Maltose is linked by an alpha-(1->4)-glycosidic bond formed from the alpha-OH on carbon 1 of the first glucose and the -OH on the carbon 4 of the second glucose.  (The image is given of two copies of alpha-D-Glucose becoming one alpha-Maltose with an oxygen covalently bonded to both where the two had hydroxyl groups near each other.  The OH group is highlighted and labeled "alpha anomer".)  (Commentary:  The teacher added something about hemiacetals and acetals that I didn't understand.  Target for further study?)

Lactose is a disaccharide of beta-D-Galactose and alpha- or beta-D-Glucose.  The bond in lactose is a Beta-(1->4)-glycosidic bond because the -OH group on carbon 1 of beta-D-galactose forms a glycosidic bond with the -OH group on carbon 4 of a D-glucose molecule.  (The example is given of Beta-D-Galactose and Alpha-D-Glucose bonding across their hydroxyls to form alpha-Lactose.  Since the alpha anomer and the beta anomer are bonding, the resulting alpha-Lactose is offset rather than having the two molecules directly next to each other.)  (Teacher's Commentary:  Something about the glucose side of alpha-Lactose being a hemiacetal that can open and close.)

Sucrose, or table sugar, consists of alpha-D-glucose and beta-D-fructose.  It has an alpha,beta-(1->2)-glycosidic bond between carbon 1 of glucose and carbon 2 of fructose.
