15.4 Chemical Properties of Monosaccharides

Sugar alcoholes such as D-sorbitol, d-xylitol from d-xylose, and d-mannitol from d-mannose are used as sweeteners in many sugar-free products such as diet drinks and sugarless gum as well as products for people with diabetes.  (The examples is given of D-glucose hydrogenating to...  Not finished in time.)

Monosaccharides, found mostly as cyclic forms in solution, have small amounts of the open-chain form present that can undergo reactions.  They have an aldehyde group with an adjacent hydroxyl that can be oxidized to carboxylic acid by an oxidizing agent such as Benedict's solution.  (The example is given of D-glucose oxidizing to D-gluconic acid)

Sugar acids (carboxylic acids) are produced from the oxidation of the sugar aldehyde as CU^2+ (from Benedict's solution) is reduced into CU+.  (The example is given of D-Glucose oxidizing to D-Gluconic acid.)

A carbohydrate (in its open-chain form) that can reduce another substance is called a reducing sugar.  Reducing sugars include the monosaccharides glucose, galactose, and fructose.  Benedict's reagent gives a brick-red precipitate with reducing sugars.  (The example is given of D-Glucose oxidizing to D-Glucose acid with the reactant 2CU^2+ and also producing CU2O as a product.)

Fructose, a ketohexose, contains a ketone group, which usually cannot be oxidized.  It can be oxidized in a basic Benedict's solution when a rearrangement occurs between the ketone group on C2 and the hydroxyl group on C1.  It is then converted to glucose, which has an aldehyde group with an adjacent hydroxyl that can be oxidized.  (The example is given of a rearrangement between D-Fructose here labeled ketose and D-Glucose here labeled aldose.)
