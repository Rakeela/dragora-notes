Good amaretto is the alcohol I can't permit myself.  I bought some bad amaretto recently, and it was so wretched it made me wonder if my tastes had changed.  I bought some good amaretto to remind myself what it was like, and nope.  My tastes hadn't changed.  The bad amaretto was just that awful.  The good stuff, on the other hand, is some of the only alcohol that tempts me to overindulge.  It's just so tasty!

My mental health has slightly improved in a relevant metric: using my treadmill no longer drives me barmy.  Yay!  I can get more exercise during the day with this tool.

I'm soon to return to school, and I suppose I ought to talk about that while I'm journalling.  I'm returning to classes on Monday.  I've got chemistry class and math class.  My math class has its textbook listed as "TBD", which is very frustrating as the class begins so soon.  I don't know what to expect going into class without a textbook.

I've also been working on Theoma.  I've got one fully complete manuscript that I ought to link, because it's still freely available for now.  If anyone reads this, feel free to put some comments on my disasterpiece, which I call The Tachanigh-Kelkaith.  Find it here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KwwsWa5KvYlG4M7JTLgxQuKNkFCVPC7f_liNUXcqljA/edit?usp=sharing

I've been working on the sequel as well, and I feel that my writing in the sequel is not as good as my writing in the original.  I want to build a book series called Praoziu's Dynasty!  It'll describe the founding and growth of Nidrio through the eyes of dragons near to the land god Praoziu.

I wanted to get the first draft of the sequel done before I started classes again, but that doesn't seem to be happening.  My skill at writing endings is pretty weak.  I may even write a better ending than I wrote to The Tachanigh-Kelkaith.

I've been playing Cultist Simulator lately for inspiration.  It's a grim, awful world, but it presents a sort of narrative causality of reality based upon its arcane principles.  I feel that something similar could be operational in Theoma, so I've been using it to help me create my own system of magic in my own setting.

One thing that fascinates me in Cultist Simulator is that you can increase your passions in that game through studying Glimmerings.  What are Glimmerings?  Can I do that in real life?  Can I have more passion, more creative skill, more insistent efforts at creativity!?  I want it!  One thing that can create Glimmerings in Cultist Simulator is "Study Sentimental Literature", so I'm linking this post to my new favorite book series, [[Gryphon-Insurrection]], which made me laugh and cry and connect intensely with its characters.  It's a sentimental literature to me, I think.  I don't know how it can help me with writing skill, but I feel certain that if I love it so much, it must have something to teach me.
