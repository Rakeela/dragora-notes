Whoever hacked all my accounts is imbecilically petty.  I have a category of games in Steam marked as "Ignore", and whenever I look away from the window for long enough, it always gets popped open.

I really did get chased after by stalkers after I stopped putting out cybersexually.  I expect they're enraged at me for "lying" about their "actual" reasons, but...  hey, they picked a hell of a timing window.  I've been a lifelong liberal.  I don't hate the people I cybered with, but I was an ideological kid, that got me beaten, I was then an ideological adult, etc.  

So now I can't play (f'rex) Nova Drift without the game glitching around to show off what happens to "liars" like me.  That's why I left a note about Vellos on the review for it, because he's one of the people to whom I'm a "liar".  Lots of games "glitch" distinctively ever since all my computers got hacked, and the people who chase after me with gaslighting hatred are... not really liberal, nor really honest.

I've been pretty honest.  I wish I'd had that reciprocated with honesty.
