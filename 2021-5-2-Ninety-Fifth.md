#2021-5-2-Ninety-Fifth

I have been entirely sick today.  I have spent much of the day hardly able to move, with my head full of unclear and useless thoughts.  I played Stellaris for a while, which I'd say is the most impressive thing I've achieved, and even that was eventually too draining to continue.  Practically, I answered one easy math question of tomorrow's homework, and redried something that was already dry.  There are wet clothes in the washer as I started a load and never had the energy to move it over.

Exhaustion and pain, all day today.  I felt like I slept very well, and I woke up feeling good.  I proceeded to start my day with two Lara bars and a Huel bar, and I've felt terrible ever since.

The Huel bar is too common to be a culprit, but the Lara bars are a goodly dose of fructose.  I don't like fruit!  Maybe there's some sense to that.  I'm thinking I should swear off Lara bars and in the morning eat no fruit save bananas.  Starting my day with some combination of protein, fat, and nothing has a much better track record.

Last night in the evening, I thought to myself that I should consider fasting today.  Had I done that, one of two things would have been true today.  Firstly, if it was my dietary choices that ruined my energy today, I would not have made the same choices.

I met one of the transhumanists who previously sexually exploited me, today.  He rose up friendly-like yesterday, and was friendly again today.  He apologized, but today as well he described himself as deathly drained and out of fucks to give.

It sounds like karma hit him hard for misusing me.
